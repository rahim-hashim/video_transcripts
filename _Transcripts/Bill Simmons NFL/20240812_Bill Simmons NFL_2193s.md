# Five Favorites: Fantasy Football Targets | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [August 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=0.0s)]
*  So on Thursday's podcast, we premiered a new segment called five favorites. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=0.24s)]
*  Joe house was here for that and it was spectacular. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=4.16s)]
*  We brought in Anthony to Bundo. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  He picked his five favorite NFL futures house. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=7.8s)]
*  You had low expectations, surpassed all of them. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=10.28s)]
*  Correct. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Well, just because I thought you were going to try and speed rhyme us through [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=13.4s)]
*  on these, these five picks, but thank God the pod father knows, let the thing [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=17.28s)]
*  breathe, we went double the amount of time you gave us. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=21.36s)]
*  It was wonderful. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=23.740000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=24.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=25.44s)]
*  It's same way when we dinner and you decide to get the second entree. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=25.72s)]
*  I let it breathe. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=29.56s)]
*  It's like, okay, fine. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  We'll get the veal chap. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=31.32s)]
*  Craig Horlbeck is here. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=32.64s)]
*  He produces the rewatchables with me. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=33.68s)]
*  He just hosted the dodge ball pod dodge ball podcast, a movie that I did. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=36.12s)]
*  I liked and didn't like when it came out. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=42.36s)]
*  I wrote a kind of half-assed I like this, but everyone in my theater [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=44.0s)]
*  was stone kind of review of it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=47.36s)]
*  But I think you were sick of Ben Stiller in 2004. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=48.8s)]
*  I, when I was 10 years old in 2004, I had no, I was not [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  oversaturated with Ben Stiller. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=54.72s)]
*  So I love it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=55.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  Well, that's the thing about the rewatchables. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=57.88s)]
*  You never know. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=59.56s)]
*  Like hardball becomes a belated classic. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  You know, the re the replacements, a movie that was like truly terrible [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  in the theater and now it's like, I love the replacements. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=66.92s)]
*  I'm glad it's on. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  You just don't know. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=69.76s)]
*  Craig's also on our fantasy football podcast, which is going to become relevant [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=70.52000000000001s)]
*  in a second and he's on the town as well. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=73.76s)]
*  Our excellent Hollywood podcast. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  All right, Craig, your assignment. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  Five fantasy targets, your favorites. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=79.72s)]
*  And we're going to go in reverse order from five to one. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  We are four weeks away from the start of the season. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=88.36s)]
*  The five guys you were staring at and you're in the same position that I was [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  in for years when I had my column way back when, when I would write fantasy [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=96.04s)]
*  football, which was controversial on page two back in the day, people were like, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=100.28s)]
*  you're writing entire fantasy football columns. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=103.48s)]
*  And I put all my sleepers and my stay aways and everybody in my league would [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  read the column and then I would just get completely F so you're in the same boat [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=109.12s)]
*  with that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=113.08000000000001s)]
*  So it's almost like you have to accept it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=113.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  I mean, we're doing a ringer fantasy draft later today and I, you're just [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=116.04s)]
*  going to steal all the players that I did give you right now. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=121.08000000000001s)]
*  I can't wait to do it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=121.84s)]
*  Uh, all right. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=123.12s)]
*  Your number five in reverse order, your fifth favorite target of the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=123.72s)]
*  2024 season is, uh, Derek Henry on the Ravens. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  Look, I just turned 30 last week and I feel great. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=131.88s)]
*  And now I'm convincing myself that 30 is just a number and there is no age [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=134.28s)]
*  cliff for 30 to 25, 30 to 25 modern medicine. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=138.16s)]
*  So every year I never draft Eric Henry because I think it's going to be the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=142.44s)]
*  year that it ends, that he falls off the cliff and he never really does. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=145.2s)]
*  And last year on the, on a terrible Titans team, he was still a top 15 guy. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=148.44s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=152.72s)]
*  He was 16, but still they were a bottom five offensive scoring, terrible [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=153.0s)]
*  O line and he had no room to run. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  Now I would argue he's in the best situation of his career in Baltimore. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  Since Lamar has been a quarterback in Baltimore, the Ravens have averaged the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=163.44s)]
*  most yards per carry in the league and they're number one in yards before [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  contact it's because everyone's afraid of Lamar, which gives all these guys [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=169.44s)]
*  room to run. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=173.36s)]
*  It's why Gus Edwards and JK Dobbins averaged six yards of carry. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  And now if you would say, Oh, well, you know, Lamar in the red zone, Derek [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=177.60000000000002s)]
*  Henry's not going to score as many touchdowns as he typically does. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  The Ravens don't use Lamar in the red zone. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  They want to keep them healthy. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=185.64000000000001s)]
*  They don't give him a fourth of the carries that guys like Josh Allen or [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  Jalen Hertz gets. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=190.8s)]
*  No touch push with Lamar. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  Not with Lamar. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=194.28000000000003s)]
*  And it's, it's easy to see because Gus Edwards last year had 13 touchdowns and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=195.12s)]
*  now we're upgrading to Derek Henry. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=199.84s)]
*  So to me, Derek Henry is discount Jonathan Taylor this year. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=201.56s)]
*  And I think, I think he's a first rounder. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=205.28s)]
*  Discount Jonathan Taylor house. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=207.76s)]
*  Your reaction. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=209.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=210.24s)]
*  I kind of love it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  Um, but before I give my full breakdown, I just want to say, speaking of staring [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=211.76s)]
*  at guys, I mean, every time I get on with, with Craig, his, his handsomeness, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  it just comes through. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=220.84s)]
*  He like, he gets better. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=221.76s)]
*  He talks about turning 30. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=222.6s)]
*  He gets better with, with age. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=224.16s)]
*  If sorority would put his box on, we could do ringer only fans. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=225.48000000000002s)]
*  This is like, talk about a full set of handsome, but speaking of handsome, I [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=229.4s)]
*  love this Derek Henry pick and it's exact. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=234.92s)]
*  So there is no touch push with Lamar Jackson's cause he's got a tiny touch. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  He's a skinny dude and they don't want him up in that muck. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  Anyway, what you want is the big bull and that's Derek Henry. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  That's a guy you could trust. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  You know what he won't do at the goal line and what Baltimore can count on. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=251.95999999999998s)]
*  He ain't going to fumble the football, trying to get across the line. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=255.44s)]
*  They have a middle of the road offensive line in Baltimore. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=259.48s)]
*  That's fine because Derek Henry can cover up a lot of that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=264.32s)]
*  So notwithstanding whatever you might get from him in terms of rushing yards, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=268.08s)]
*  you're always going to have those goal line situations. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=273.16s)]
*  And you know, Craig said it 13 TDs. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=276.56s)]
*  That is nothing to sneeze at. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=279.64s)]
*  You know, I was doing a whole bunch of football work the last five weeks, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=282.56s)]
*  including fantasy tears, which I do every year, which is a key podcast for you guys [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=286.6s)]
*  when you're doing the show. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=291.36s)]
*  And I went back and I looked at my fantasy tears for running backs from two years ago. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=292.8s)]
*  Running backs are now like porn stars. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=297.6s)]
*  Like you go back and look at like the 2000, the 2022 AVN awards and it's just [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=299.6s)]
*  a slew of actors and actresses and two years later, it's a completely different [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=305.44s)]
*  slew of actors and actresses. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=308.88s)]
*  The names change. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=310.04s)]
*  Like Damien Harris, I think was in my third running back tier two, three years ago. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=312.12s)]
*  I don't even know if he's in the NFL anymore. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=316.36s)]
*  So who's Derek Henry? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=318.28000000000003s)]
*  Lisa Ann? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  I don't... [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=319.32s)]
*  Is Derek Henry? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  He's just survived, but I noticed him. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=322.92s)]
*  I noticed McCaffrey and this is, we're talking like three years ago. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=326.04s)]
*  And now you think like how fast it changes where you guys did your tears and [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=329.56s)]
*  Breece Hall and B. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=333.6s)]
*  John Robinson at the top. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=335.04s)]
*  A chain caused the 15 minute conversation and none of those guys existed three years ago. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=337.04s)]
*  But it's just funny that Henry, we're wondering, does he still have it? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=343.04s)]
*  And he's 30. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=346.44s)]
*  It's not like he's 45. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=347.04s)]
*  There's usually a four year cycle with running backs and we are at the beginning of a [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=348.36s)]
*  new four year stretch. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=352.28000000000003s)]
*  It's yeah, Breece Hall, B. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=353.16s)]
*  John Robinson, Jonathan Taylor. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=354.32000000000005s)]
*  A lot of people love Jumeir Gibbs, but I just think Henry is in the freak category. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=355.8s)]
*  Like he's in the LeBron camp where he's different. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=363.40000000000003s)]
*  We have to judge him on a different curve than everybody else. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=365.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=368.52s)]
*  And this has been the case since he was like 15 years old. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=368.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  He was playing high school football and just demolishing people. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=372.52s)]
*  He's always been the biggest guy. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=375.08s)]
*  He's still the biggest guy. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=376.68s)]
*  That matters. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=379.4s)]
*  The case for it is this is like almost like when the Patriots got Corey Dillon in 2004 [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=379.56s)]
*  when Craig was like 10 years old. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=385.52s)]
*  But this guy that had kind of been buried on bad teams and people still thought the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=387.71999999999997s)]
*  pedigree was there, but we weren't quite positive. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=391.96s)]
*  And then Corey Dillon was just awesome. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=394.03999999999996s)]
*  On the Pats and the fact that Lamar just doesn't get running touchdowns. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  I like it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=400.59999999999997s)]
*  I saw no real signs of attrition with Henry last year. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=401.12s)]
*  I agree with Craig. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=403.96s)]
*  Like he's had bad quarterbacks and a bad offensive line. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=404.64s)]
*  So it was even hard to say like how unstoppable he was, but I like that one. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=407.76s)]
*  That's, I think it's a fair one. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=412.4s)]
*  I don't know who he's competing for, for touchdowns running wise. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=414.52s)]
*  Who's like the backup in ball. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=418.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=419.71999999999997s)]
*  It's, he's going to get him if he's healthy and he's going to be healthy. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=420.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=423.08s)]
*  I would not be surprised if he had 15 touchdowns this year. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=423.32s)]
*  I don't think anybody would. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=425.8s)]
*  Do you, do you have a chain is one of your five or no? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=427.92s)]
*  I don't on this list. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=431.24s)]
*  Is it yours? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=432.48s)]
*  No, I wanted to tell house they, they had a huge argument about a chain in the, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=433.76000000000005s)]
*  in the running back tears podcast that I ended up texting the guys about where [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=438.76000000000005s)]
*  a every year there's a guy who just, you're jealous of somebody else takes them. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=443.16s)]
*  If you take them, you know what the stakes are. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=448.8s)]
*  And I compared them to the veal chop. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=450.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=452.92s)]
*  Every year there's a veal chop guy when you're at dinner and somebody [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=454.04s)]
*  orders the veal chop and it's a 50 50 order, depending on the restaurant. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=457.84s)]
*  You just thought if it's a blind restaurant that you've never been to, and [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=462.04s)]
*  somebody gets the veal chop and it's not you and you're like, I hope the veal chop [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=465.0s)]
*  sucks because if the veal chops good, I'm going to have so many regrets. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=469.36s)]
*  Or if you order it, you're like, I'm super hungry. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=472.16s)]
*  I probably should have gotten the steak. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=475.16s)]
*  It's a safe bet, but the veal chop might be awesome. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=476.72s)]
*  I'm just going to roll the dice with the veal chop. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=479.64s)]
*  And that's basically a chain this year. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=481.44s)]
*  He will either be incredible or it's going to be week four. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=484.0s)]
*  And you're like, oh my God, he had seven carries for 20 yards. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=488.4s)]
*  What happened? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=491.44s)]
*  He like twists his knee and he's out for eight weeks. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=491.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=494.6s)]
*  And you're like, like, how did he go for $39 in my league? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=495.2s)]
*  That's my concern with Karen Williams. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=499.6s)]
*  That that's the twist. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=501.4s)]
*  That's another one. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=503.4s)]
*  That that's the one. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=504.24s)]
*  Well, how many small injuries and medium sized injuries does he had already? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=505.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=509.72s)]
*  He's not a big guy and they just drafted Blake Corum out of Michigan. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=510.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=513.2s)]
*  And the question with somebody like that is, can he have 280 carries? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=513.76s)]
*  Is he going to be there in a week? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=518.56s)]
*  14, 15, 16. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=519.64s)]
*  Henry has the pedigree of we know he's going to be there. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=521.28s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=523.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=524.04s)]
*  Your number four guy is. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=524.28s)]
*  This one's a little more controversial. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=525.88s)]
*  I'm really like putting my reputation on the line for this. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=527.24s)]
*  This is definitely a sleeper. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=529.1999999999999s)]
*  This is not like a top 20 guy. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=530.64s)]
*  I love Josh Palmer on the chargers this year. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=532.72s)]
*  I feel like I am alone on a mountain top shouting Josh Palmer's name. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=535.64s)]
*  I know in your head, you're like, Oh, Josh Palmer, what is he like? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=539.8800000000001s)]
*  27 years old, fifth round pick. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=543.0400000000001s)]
*  He's actually 24 years old and he was a third round pick. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=545.12s)]
*  And now Kenan Allen and Mike Williams are gone in LA. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=548.44s)]
*  And now Josh Palmer is easily the most experienced receiver on this team. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=552.0s)]
*  Everyone other than Palmer is either a rookie, a bust, or has never [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=556.1600000000001s)]
*  played with Justin Herbert before. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=559.8800000000001s)]
*  And if you look at all the other guys on the team, only two have [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=561.6800000000001s)]
*  caught a touchdown from Justin Herbert. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=565.2s)]
*  One is Simi Fahoko, who has one catch in his career and it was for a touchdown. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=566.52s)]
*  And the other is Quentin Johnson, the first round bus from last year at a TCU. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=570.8s)]
*  So we're calling him a bus just cause he had one bad year. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=574.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean, he can't even crack the first team in practice right now behind DJ chart. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=577.4s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=581.6s)]
*  And I mean, the coaching staff has no ties to him. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=583.04s)]
*  It's not like his competition is incredible and he can't, he still [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=586.96s)]
*  can't break the first team. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=589.68s)]
*  Palmer's got nine Tatsuns over the last three years. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=591.16s)]
*  And if you look at him last year, he was banged up. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=593.48s)]
*  He was on pace for a thousand yards while playing with Keenan Allen. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=595.6s)]
*  And now Mike Williams and Josh Palmer and Keenan Allen are gone. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=599.4000000000001s)]
*  And my rule in fantasy football, I've decided I don't draft wide receivers [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=602.6400000000001s)]
*  for shitty quarterbacks. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=606.7600000000001s)]
*  Like I just won't do it. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=607.8000000000001s)]
*  It's not fun. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=609.44s)]
*  It's like the arrested development line. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=610.12s)]
*  Like I have the worst fucking attorneys. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=611.5600000000001s)]
*  Like I'm just not doing it if you have a bad quarterback. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=613.0400000000001s)]
*  And I think we all need to admit that Josh Palmer's a quality player and him [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=615.72s)]
*  going outside of the top 150 and drafts is ridiculous. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=619.6800000000001s)]
*  I think he's going to be the leading wide receiver on the chargers. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=623.36s)]
*  So the people that would foil that would be McConkey if he turns out to be good. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=626.24s)]
*  Who's hurt right now, but I do like McConkey, but that's really it. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=631.16s)]
*  He's a rookie and he's hurt. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=635.04s)]
*  DJ, DJ Chark. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=635.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=637.4s)]
*  Uh, yeah, it's a good point because if it's a bad quarterback, odds are nobody [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=638.28s)]
*  will get the yards and the touchdowns. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=644.2s)]
*  But if it's an above average quarterback or a good quarterback, the [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=646.68s)]
*  yards have to go somewhere. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=650.44s)]
*  How many guys have we seen over the years end up with 1200 yards? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=651.64s)]
*  And I'm like, wait, that guy and like 1190 yards, he sucks. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=654.56s)]
*  How did that happen? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=658.4s)]
*  The Harbaugh, Greg Roman offense, they were together in San Francisco and [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=659.36s)]
*  everyone's like, well, they're just going to run the ball all the time. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=663.3199999999999s)]
*  They're not going to throw. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=664.84s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=665.64s)]
*  They're still going to throw a little bit in those touchdowns, those [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=666.6s)]
*  Niners years, Michael Crabtree and Anquan Bolden and Vernon Davis. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=669.76s)]
*  So it's guys were all putting up solid fantasy years and we're just ignoring [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=672.6s)]
*  every everybody who catches passes on the chargers and I, and it's just because [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=676.24s)]
*  Josh Palmer is irrelevant and unsexy. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=679.56s)]
*  Well, the other piece with that is, um, I I've actually liked Josh Palmer [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=682.36s)]
*  and games that I've watched. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=686.6s)]
*  Josh Palmer is good. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=688.68s)]
*  He's one of those guys. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=689.88s)]
*  If he's on the fantasy wire, you need to give him the extra look. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=690.84s)]
*  Where do you stand house? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=693.12s)]
*  Where do you stand on the chargers offense and people scoring touchdowns on it? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=693.88s)]
*  I know this one's dicey or house. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=697.48s)]
*  So I I'll be okay if you don't like this one. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=698.72s)]
*  Well, it's, it's not that I don't like it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=700.72s)]
*  Where are we supposed to take them? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=702.56s)]
*  What's the right price that that will help me understand it. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=704.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=707.5600000000001s)]
*  Is he like an $11 guy? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=707.76s)]
*  Like in the second tier when people are paying like 17 bucks to get whoever. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=710.08s)]
*  And you feel like you can kind of get him. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=716.5200000000001s)]
*  You'll be able to get him for less than 10 bucks right now. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=718.44s)]
*  If you, in terms of like rankings, he's going outside the top one 20, sometimes [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=720.48s)]
*  one 50, I think that's insane. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=723.88s)]
*  He should be going into the top 75 top. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=726.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=728.2s)]
*  Any number one receiver with a good quarterback at least should [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=728.36s)]
*  top eight quarterbacks. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=733.2s)]
*  Sure. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=734.24s)]
*  But you bring up a different point off of that point, which is Herbert, who I [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=734.96s)]
*  think used to be somebody everybody loved having on their fantasy team and. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=739.88s)]
*  You know, we'd go for bigger bucks for quarterback auctions and you'd be a higher [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=744.56s)]
*  draft pick, but people seem to be terrified of him. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=748.3199999999999s)]
*  He's hurt. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=751.36s)]
*  It's got the planner, planner, fashion thing. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=752.28s)]
*  He's got the hardball offense. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=754.92s)]
*  Is he even a fantasy starter this year? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=757.3199999999999s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=760.0799999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=761.52s)]
*  He's not going to run a lot. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=762.48s)]
*  I think they're going to be like bottom five in the league and passing. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=763.44s)]
*  Oh, I think the team is going to be good and it's probably going to be better [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=766.24s)]
*  overall and real football, but no, I don't think he should be a time. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=769.08s)]
*  Can I throw a quarterback set you guys and tell me if you would take Justin [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=773.84s)]
*  Herbert over them, just in fantasy. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=777.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=779.2800000000001s)]
*  Oh, let's do that. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=779.8800000000001s)]
*  Bryce Young. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=782.5600000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=783.96s)]
*  You would take him over Bryce Young. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=786.9200000000001s)]
*  I would. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=788.5200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=789.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=789.7600000000001s)]
*  I want to answer it correctly. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=789.96s)]
*  I would take Herbert over Bryce Young. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=791.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=793.0400000000001s)]
*  Trevor Lawrence. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=793.24s)]
*  I'd rather have Lawrence. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=795.04s)]
*  Me too. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=796.04s)]
*  Jayden Daniels. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=798.76s)]
*  Jayden Daniels easily. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=800.32s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=801.8s)]
*  I feel like I need to recuse myself. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=802.84s)]
*  I have too much invested. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=805.48s)]
*  What do you mean recuse yourself? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=807.5600000000001s)]
*  Why can't you just answer it honestly? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=809.6800000000001s)]
*  Because Baker Mayfield? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=811.84s)]
*  Baker Mayfield? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=813.44s)]
*  No. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=814.12s)]
*  Herbert's better. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=814.92s)]
*  So he's somewhere between Jayden Daniels and Baker Mayfield. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=816.92s)]
*  I have him 14th. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=820.36s)]
*  Would you rather have him or Rogers? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=822.36s)]
*  Oh, that's close because I think both teams aren't going to throw a ton. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=825.04s)]
*  Probably Herbert. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=831.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=833.0s)]
*  That's close. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=833.36s)]
*  I would be fine if you wanted Rogers. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=834.32s)]
*  Would you rather have Deshaun Watson or Matt Ryan who's no longer in the league? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=836.84s)]
*  It's close. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=843.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=844.28s)]
*  Deshaun Watson, a lot of upside. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=845.0s)]
*  Look, the Deshaun Watson that won that game against Baltimore in Baltimore in [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=847.12s)]
*  that fourth quarter by essentially running. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=853.0s)]
*  I think that version of the offense is there if they can protect him. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=857.1999999999999s)]
*  They didn't ask him to throw the ball more than 10 yards down the field over [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=862.4399999999999s)]
*  that entire stretch and they kicked Baltimore's ass. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=867.48s)]
*  They out physicaled them. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=870.16s)]
*  So if that's the version of Deshaun that becomes the blueprint for [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=872.12s)]
*  Cleveland this upcoming season, I don't hate him. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=875.32s)]
*  And that's all we need to hear from Deshaun Watson's defense attorney, Joe House. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=879.44s)]
*  Well, he didn't play any more games after that because he got hurt. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=884.08s)]
*  That was the last game, but his last, he went out on a high. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=887.2800000000001s)]
*  I like the Josh Palmer one. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=890.44s)]
*  I'm in on that one. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=891.5600000000001s)]
*  It is one of those things that where I feel like when we get closer to opening [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=892.5200000000001s)]
*  day and somebody really pumps him up and all of a sudden somebody's spending [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=895.84s)]
*  $16 for him in your auction. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=900.5600000000001s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=902.44s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=903.12s)]
*  I don't think anybody gives a shit about Josh Palmer. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=903.48s)]
*  No one's going to say a word when you draft him. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=905.28s)]
*  And I think he'll start for you all year. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=906.9200000000001s)]
*  What did the Danny say about this? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=908.32s)]
*  Danny Kelly is, is, is with me and high. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=910.8000000000001s)]
*  This is against me. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=912.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=914.5600000000001s)]
*  Is Josh Palmer who who's better to target in that offense? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=915.2s)]
*  All kidding aside, will this Lee or, or Josh Palmer? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=919.04s)]
*  I think it's Josh Palmer. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=922.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=923.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think so too. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=923.6800000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=924.64s)]
*  Third pick is, um, I don't know if I'm just being a contrarian because [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=925.4s)]
*  everybody else is out on this guy. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=930.92s)]
*  And sometimes I just tend to zag, uh, but I'm into Christian Watson, the [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=932.76s)]
*  receiver on the Packers who everybody's completely out on. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=936.56s)]
*  And I think he's one of the biggest steals of the year. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=939.56s)]
*  Everybody. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=941.52s)]
*  What did I do? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=942.04s)]
*  I'm going to raise my hand right here. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=942.76s)]
*  What happened? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=944.52s)]
*  I hate this is all sports hate and fantasy, but I fantasy fucking hate his guts. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=945.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=950.96s)]
*  He killed me last year and I traded for him and then he immediately turned it on. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=952.64s)]
*  I was so mad. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=956.04s)]
*  I traded him to you. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=957.0s)]
*  Well, I know I got him. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=958.68s)]
*  Oh, this is the time to buy. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=960.0s)]
*  Let me tell you why. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=962.04s)]
*  I think he's discount Mike Evans. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=963.12s)]
*  I really do. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=964.6s)]
*  This is exactly the situation you want in fantasy. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=965.68s)]
*  He's an affordable number one guy in the offense. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=968.84s)]
*  The offense is very good. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=971.56s)]
*  He has an elite quarterback, great play caller. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=972.72s)]
*  I think we're just overthinking all of this. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=975.72s)]
*  Everybody's in love with Don Tavian Wicks and Jayden Reed, who I think are all good [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=977.16s)]
*  players, but when Christian Watson was actually on the field and playing, it was [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=980.84s)]
*  clear that he was the number one option. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=985.6s)]
*  He led the team in targets and end zone targets and Ariards. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=986.88s)]
*  He played eight, nine games last year and in those nine games, he led the [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=991.12s)]
*  league and end zone targets. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=994.04s)]
*  Like this, this guy's, do you remember his rookie season? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=995.64s)]
*  He had eight touchdowns and I had him that year. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=997.76s)]
*  Yeah, no, he was kind of electric. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=999.88s)]
*  He reminds me of Drake London where these guys in fantasy who don't actually [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1002.08s)]
*  produce, but they become sexier picks than maybe the value is. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1007.0s)]
*  And with the Watson thing, we just haven't seen him stay on the [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1011.12s)]
*  field for an entire season. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1013.24s)]
*  And also I really, I worry about how good their receivers are. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1015.6s)]
*  Like maybe it's one of those teams that just, they have four good guys. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1019.6s)]
*  Maybe there is no number one receiver on that team. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1023.2s)]
*  Is that possible? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1025.32s)]
*  It's possible, but usually the cream rises to the top. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1026.48s)]
*  And with him there, we have like a sample size of last year. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1029.32s)]
*  He was clearly the number one guy when they were all on the field. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1032.44s)]
*  He just had his hamstring issue and it was the same thing. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1035.0s)]
*  Kamara had, I don't know if you guys remember that from last year. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1037.6s)]
*  He had like, basically his legs weighed different amounts. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1040.32s)]
*  Chris Watson's muscles in his legs are very imbalanced. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1043.6s)]
*  And he realized that this off season, one leg was 20% stronger than the other [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1047.4s)]
*  leg and Kamara had the same issue. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1051.52s)]
*  And it's why he kept pulling his hamstring over and over. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1052.8s)]
*  And now he's claimed that they're only 6% apart and he's fixed it. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1054.92s)]
*  And he's been healthy all camp and he looks great. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1057.8s)]
*  So I think this is why Craig, this is why Craig, it's one of the top fantasy [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1059.92s)]
*  football podcasts, because we talk about leg weight percentages, 6% feels [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1064.04s)]
*  like it's in the right ballpark. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1068.4s)]
*  What are we going to say, house? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1070.1200000000001s)]
*  Just that I lived through this with Keenan Allen two years ago when I [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1071.28s)]
*  bought him for $42 in our auction league and the mother effer pulled a hamstring [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1075.24s)]
*  and never like showed up and then came back last year and was effing dominant [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1079.68s)]
*  the whole season so much so that I think he helped, you know, somebody, uh, you [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1084.8s)]
*  know, finished very high in our league. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1090.0s)]
*  The Christian Watson proposition makes so much sense because he is their vertical [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1092.52s)]
*  game, he stretches the field. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1096.32s)]
*  He's the guy that gets the most out of what Jordan love is best at to me, which [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1097.8s)]
*  is getting the ball to F down the field with accuracy. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1102.1599999999999s)]
*  Watson's a beneficiary of it. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1105.12s)]
*  I like this. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1106.56s)]
*  Where do we take them though, Craig? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1107.28s)]
*  What's the right price? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1108.84s)]
*  Where are we getting it? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1109.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1110.6s)]
*  What tier? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1110.7199999999998s)]
*  What tier? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1111.24s)]
*  You haven't done receiver tiers yet. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1111.6799999999998s)]
*  So is he, what's he like tier four, tier three? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1113.28s)]
*  Yeah, right now the great thing about him is he's incredibly affordable. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1116.28s)]
*  He's going like 80th overall right now. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1119.36s)]
*  And meanwhile, like Nico Collins is going in his, in the thirties. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1121.76s)]
*  And you tell me what is the major difference? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1125.24s)]
*  Yeah, but Nico Collins plays football every day. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1128.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1130.6s)]
*  Fair. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1130.9599999999998s)]
*  But you were talking about, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1131.9199999999998s)]
*  Nico Collins stays in the field. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1132.6399999999999s)]
*  There's one. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1133.52s)]
*  I mean, but you were like, oh, there's a million right receivers in Green Bay. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1134.3999999999999s)]
*  Who, you know, how many balls is Christian Watson going to get? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1137.56s)]
*  Well, Nico Collins is going up against Stefan Diggs, Tank Del. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1140.1599999999999s)]
*  No one seems to care about that. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1143.36s)]
*  And yet there's much less competition in my opinion in Green Bay with [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1145.56s)]
*  Christian Watson, you get them 50 spots later. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1148.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's pretty good. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1152.12s)]
*  I'm, I'm on Watson. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1153.3999999999999s)]
*  I like it. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1154.36s)]
*  Well, house loves Green Bay. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1154.7199999999998s)]
*  I feel like house is. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1155.84s)]
*  Green Bay could, could be every year there's a team that could really just [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1157.76s)]
*  kill people from an NFL future standpoint, from a division bed standpoint, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1161.9199999999998s)]
*  from wind total standpoint, from fantasy standpoint, they're being treated. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1166.52s)]
*  Like they are, you know, one of the great offenses of the 2020s, the [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1170.9199999999998s)]
*  way we're all talking about them. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1175.24s)]
*  And I include myself, cause I think they're going to be really good. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1176.36s)]
*  And I'm just wondering like how disappointing it could get. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1179.1599999999999s)]
*  Uh, that's fair. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1184.04s)]
*  I mean, what you want to do is, is like, you want to find those [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1184.8799999999999s)]
*  offenses that are going to take the big leap in fantasy. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1187.04s)]
*  If you were able to predict the Texans ascension last year, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1189.08s)]
*  you would have won your league. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1193.6399999999999s)]
*  And so it's like, you know, we were doing that with, we were doing that [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1194.56s)]
*  with Atlanta for like three years in a row and we were paying 25 bucks for [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1196.84s)]
*  Kyle Pitts. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1200.68s)]
*  Yeah, we're doing, we're back doing it one more time. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1201.44s)]
*  But yeah, sometimes it's not an offense you expect that ends up being the offense. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1204.0s)]
*  I just think it's weird that everybody's in love with the Packers. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1208.04s)]
*  Everybody thinks they're a top five team. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1210.52s)]
*  People have them as a Superbowl contender and like there's nobody on their team [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1212.32s)]
*  getting drafted in the top 40 in fantasy. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1215.6s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1218.32s)]
*  That's fair. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1218.6399999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1220.08s)]
*  We're down to the top two. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1220.52s)]
*  Who do you have in the number two spot? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1222.76s)]
*  Uh, I've, I've never said this in my life, but I'm betting on the jets and I, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1224.56s)]
*  I love Garrett Wilson. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1228.28s)]
*  I think it, I think he's going to be one of the best wide receivers in the league. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1230.12s)]
*  I have him as my third wide receiver off the board. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1233.56s)]
*  I genuinely do not see a scenario in which he's not a top five guy, unless he [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1236.28s)]
*  gets hurt. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1240.1999999999998s)]
*  I just don't see it. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1240.84s)]
*  Well, wait, wait, wait, unless he gets hurt, what if Rogers gets hurt? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1242.1999999999998s)]
*  Or should I say when Rogers gets hurt? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1245.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't see a non injury related scenario in which he's not a top five guy. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1247.28s)]
*  So I understand if you're worried about that, but to me, he's clearly one of the [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1252.04s)]
*  best wide receivers in the league. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1256.9199999999998s)]
*  I mean, he was fourth in the NFL and targets last year, and yet he had a [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1258.1599999999999s)]
*  terrible fantasy year because he was catching passes from Zach Wilson and Tim [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1261.1599999999999s)]
*  Boyle four and a half yards down the field. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1265.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1268.4399999999998s)]
*  The judge is all they can muster. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1268.6399999999999s)]
*  I do my, the player rankings that I do that really helped me like figure out [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1270.6799999999998s)]
*  the team and the future and all that stuff. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1274.88s)]
*  And he was the toughest one to figure out all the receivers. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1278.1200000000001s)]
*  Cause I had like as Alphas, Jefferson and Tyreek, I think they're just at the [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1280.8400000000001s)]
*  top, like that third, I had them for five pointers and then I had Chase and Adams [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1284.96s)]
*  and Lam and AJ Brown and St. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1290.24s)]
*  Brown as the four pointer guys. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1291.96s)]
*  And I really wanted to put Wilson in that group, but it's more a Rogers thing [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1294.96s)]
*  than a Wilson thing for me. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1299.72s)]
*  I don't know if I trust Rogers to stay healthy. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1301.3600000000001s)]
*  I think from a talent standpoint, if you just switched Wilson with any of those [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1303.9199999999998s)]
*  teams, I feel like he, I just feel like he'd be in that conversation. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1308.84s)]
*  I'm with you. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1312.1599999999999s)]
*  I think from a talent standpoint, he should be in the top four. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1312.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1316.9199999999998s)]
*  I don't, what are, like, what do we expect from Rogers? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1317.52s)]
*  I know that's been a big topic, but what are, like, what's, what are the tea [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1320.1599999999999s)]
*  leaves saying? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1323.28s)]
*  Well, if you, if you draft Tyreek Hill, you got to deal with two is health. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1324.28s)]
*  I mean, you always got to factor that in with a lot of guys, but to me, I just [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1327.8799999999999s)]
*  think this is the biggest upgrade at quarterback in the history of the NFL, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1331.72s)]
*  probably. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1335.56s)]
*  And I can list you a million stats as to why last year was such a disaster. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1336.44s)]
*  I don't know if you're, do you remember week one when Rogers got hurt and Zach [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1340.4s)]
*  Wilson came in and he actually threw a touchdown to Garrett Wilson, but Wilson [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1343.6000000000001s)]
*  had to like intercept his own pass. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1346.68s)]
*  He like tipped it to himself. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1349.4s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, the Jets moved for 11 touchdowns last year in the entire season. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1351.48s)]
*  11. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1355.28s)]
*  Give house here, give house here inside the five stat. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1356.08s)]
*  Oh, for Breece Hall. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1359.84s)]
*  Uh, the Jets, the Jets were the only team in the league to not give their running [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1361.2s)]

*  They were the only team and running back. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1367.84s)]
*  That's just all the running backs in the team. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1370.56s)]
*  They did not have a carry for the one yard line and Breece Hall had one [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1373.36s)]
*  carry inside the five. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1376.52s)]
*  All year. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1379.1599999999999s)]
*  That they'll hack it, baby. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1380.3999999999999s)]
*  So I love it. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1382.8799999999999s)]
*  But yeah, also it's basically just Garrett Wilson. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1384.96s)]
*  Mike Williams is there. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1387.52s)]
*  He's coming off an ACL. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1388.44s)]
*  He's older. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1389.52s)]
*  And if you go back to all of Roger's receivers, there's a good stat that anytime [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1390.52s)]
*  a Roger's receiver has seen over 140 targets in a year, they have not finished [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1394.6399999999999s)]
*  lower than fourth at wide receiver. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1398.8799999999999s)]
*  Jordy Nelson, Craig Jennings, DeVante Adams. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1400.8s)]
*  And I think Garrett Wilson's going to see 140 targets. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1403.92s)]
*  And I think he's better than all those guys. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1406.12s)]
*  Maybe not to Vonte Adams. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1407.72s)]
*  It's to the problem with Garrett Wilson is he's going to be treated in that. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1408.6s)]
*  In that real estate bracket with Jefferson and Tyreek and Chase and AJ [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1413.32s)]
*  Brown and Lam, I think. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1418.12s)]
*  I think he's either the fourth or sixth, fourth, fifth, sixth receiver taken in [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1419.36s)]
*  any draft price wise or in a draft. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1425.08s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1428.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1429.12s)]
*  I think, I think in some drafts he'll go in the second round. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1429.68s)]
*  I think you could take him in the first. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1431.6399999999999s)]
*  Any last Garrett Wilson thoughts, house? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1435.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, you just have to be an all in person on the jets and I kind of am. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1438.3999999999999s)]
*  I've got some exposure. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1443.36s)]
*  O-line's way better. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1445.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's way better. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1446.56s)]
*  And the, the, you know, um, the, what they, what they did, uh, defensively [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1448.3200000000002s)]
*  as well, I'm just, I just think they're going to be able to control both sides [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1454.4s)]
*  of the ball and I, I like the jets. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1458.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1461.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't know what food item Garrett Wilson would be in this scenario. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1461.76s)]
*  Oh, he's, he's a delicacy. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1464.8000000000002s)]
*  Cause he's not the, he's not the veal chop. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1465.96s)]
*  It's more, it's a really high end seafood. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1467.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1470.6000000000001s)]
*  Rare, a rare sushi item. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1470.8400000000001s)]
*  We should have just done that as a podcast food items compared to. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1473.4s)]
*  It's not too late. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1477.24s)]
*  I'm here for it, baby. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1478.96s)]
*  I had the Tiki barber as the Rubin 20 years ago, where you, it's, you just know [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1480.56s)]
*  the Rubin's going to be good. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1485.96s)]
*  And if you don't order it, if somebody else at the table orders it and you're [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1487.08s)]
*  like, fucking a, the Rubin looks great. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1490.72s)]
*  Why didn't I get the Rubin? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1492.3600000000001s)]
*  It's so reliable. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1493.4s)]
*  Cut me a corner of that thing. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1494.3600000000001s)]
*  Who's the Rubin running back this year? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1495.88s)]
*  Is it Derek Henry? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1497.52s)]
*  Oh, that's not bad. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1500.16s)]
*  Every year you're like, eh, I don't know. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1501.88s)]
*  And then it's week one and he has 180 yards. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1503.76s)]
*  There can be Jonathan Taylor. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1506.04s)]
*  Sure. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1508.28s)]
*  I don't trust him. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1508.4s)]
*  I didn't, I don't, I don't like what happened with him last year. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1509.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1511.72s)]
*  It's time. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1512.0s)]
*  Craig's number one fantasy target for 2024. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1513.48s)]
*  Who is it? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1518.48s)]
*  Cooper cup. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1519.56s)]
*  I love it. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1521.8s)]
*  I felt this way. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1522.64s)]
*  I felt this way even before Puka Nakua got hurt, even though Puka is supposed [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1523.96s)]
*  to be ready and back for week one. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1527.16s)]
*  But right now you can get Cooper cup around or two later than Puka. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1529.12s)]
*  And I just think that's wrong. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1532.28s)]
*  I know he's had the injuries the last few years, but he's so [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1533.68s)]
*  affordable right now and he's healthy. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1536.84s)]
*  And I think he's incredibly slept on last year. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1538.8s)]
*  He heard his hamstring twice before the season started and then [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1540.68s)]
*  hurt his ankle again mid season. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1544.08s)]
*  And he like half got healthy at the end of the year. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1545.72s)]
*  And over those last six weeks, him and Puka were both top 10 guys at the position. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1548.88s)]
*  And I just, cups a maniac about health. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1553.32s)]
*  Puka's already hurt. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1555.24s)]
*  Puka was working out with cup this off season and was throwing up every day [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1556.48s)]
*  because Cooper cup works out so hard. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1559.36s)]
*  I'm like, well, he's 31. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1561.44s)]
*  He's not 37. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1563.28s)]
*  He's two years removed from winning the triple crown. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1565.1200000000001s)]
*  And this offense is only going to go to Puka and Cooper cup. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1567.76s)]
*  And I I'm completely trusting the connection between Stafford and cup. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1570.96s)]
*  I think the Rams are going to be really good this year. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1574.72s)]
*  And I basically, in my opinion, I'm getting the same old Cooper [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1577.0s)]
*  cup for like half the price. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1579.84s)]
*  And he's also hit that age, which has been happening with fantasy football [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1583.0s)]
*  ever since we started playing fantasy football where guys become boring to take. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1586.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1591.4s)]
*  Especially when they hit their thirties. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1591.72s)]
*  Tina Nguyen last year was perfect example of that. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1593.24s)]
*  This was Marvin Harrison forever. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1595.28s)]
*  It was like, ah, I've had Marvin Harrison. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1597.6s)]
*  Then he would go for eight bucks less than he should have gone for. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1599.28s)]
*  And all of a sudden you're like, oh shit, you know, who's the top four [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1601.88s)]
*  receiver again, Marvin Harrison. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1604.96s)]
*  Um, the Cooper cup reading about him this year, he's hitting a lot of the [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1606.6s)]
*  check marks of the guy who's just like last year was the year from hell. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1613.08s)]
*  I'm never letting that happen again. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1617.08s)]
*  I'm an absolute fucking maniac this off season teammates talking about. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1619.24s)]
*  I've never seen the look in his eye. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1623.2s)]
*  Like I've seen this year, like, it's been a lot of that people like, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1625.04s)]
*  holy shit, he's a man possessed. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1628.1200000000001s)]
*  So I, I always liked that stuff too. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1630.44s)]
*  I will say with fantasy and with real and with any sport, I almost think [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1632.8s)]
*  we need a new name for pulled hamstring. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1637.8400000000001s)]
*  It should just be like gunshot wound. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1641.88s)]
*  Like it's, it doesn't sound dangerous enough for what it is. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1645.2s)]
*  And you only get, it just happened to my daughter. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1648.56s)]
*  Like you, you have a hamstring and it's like, yeah, it should be four to six weeks. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1650.64s)]
*  It's not, it's basically like somebody took an elephant gun and shot you in the [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1654.0s)]
*  leg and it's never the same for months. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1657.3600000000001s)]
*  We can, we always say you pull the muscle. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1659.92s)]
*  What it really is, is a tear. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1661.8000000000002s)]
*  We should be saying torn hamstring. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1663.0800000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1665.2800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1666.0400000000002s)]
*  There's no such thing as a, as a hamstring pull toward the muscle and it takes [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1666.2s)]
*  forever and you can't come back from it because when you come back, you just [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1670.4s)]
*  keep making it worse and you keep making it worse and it never recovers or gets better. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1674.0800000000002s)]
*  I support strong language like severed, severed hamstring detached. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1678.6s)]
*  I mean, detached probably, I don't know. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1683.76s)]
*  Hamstring, ax wound. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1685.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1687.12s)]
*  It just needs to sound more dangerous than it is, but yeah, he was never the same. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1687.32s)]
*  And then finally last, I don't know, six weeks started to look more like cup. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1691.4399999999998s)]
*  But at that point, Naku had passed him. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1696.32s)]
*  I have some slight concerns about the Rams because I think they were better [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1698.12s)]
*  than people realized last year. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1702.4799999999998s)]
*  And I thought they were discount Detroit for really the last two months of the [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1703.8799999999999s)]
*  season, especially in what they got from Williams at running back and some, some [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1708.76s)]
*  stuff went right for them last year. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1713.6s)]
*  And I'm just these top heavy teams. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1715.1999999999998s)]
*  It's just takes like two guys going down and all of a sudden, like your season [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1718.0s)]
*  spiraling out of control, but fundamentally it's a fun, it's a fun one. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1721.4399999999998s)]
*  Plus you're betting on pedigree. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1725.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1727.52s)]
*  I'm not playing for sixth place. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1727.6799999999998s)]
*  Like if it all blows up, it all blows up. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1728.84s)]
*  You know, I'll take my. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1730.8s)]
*  Here's the reason for cup and, and it's supportive of, of, of what both of you are [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1731.76s)]
*  saying. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1737.1599999999999s)]
*  I also think that the Rams are prepared to take a step back. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1738.08s)]
*  It's on defense. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1742.1999999999998s)]
*  It's on defense because Aaron Donald is irreplaceable. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1743.3999999999999s)]
*  They grabbed two Florida state, um, defensive linemen, and that's awesome. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1747.04s)]
*  Like great team building, great job by them, but the sheer, uh, vacuum that is [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1752.24s)]
*  left by Donald not being there, it's going to expose, they had two rookies last year, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1758.24s)]
*  you know, accumulate most of the sacks, most of the pressures because Aaron [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1764.24s)]
*  Donald's is occupying for human beings. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1767.68s)]
*  All it was. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1770.16s)]
*  So I think the defense is, is, you know, their, their front seven is like a, a [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1771.2s)]
*  bottom 10 front seven, their secondary is in the same class. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1776.56s)]
*  So what that means is the Rams are going to be playing from behind. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1780.3600000000001s)]
*  And if they're playing from behind and Cooper cup is going to be a prime target. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1783.2s)]
*  And as long as Matthew Stafford is healthy, then I like this idea of, of [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1787.6000000000001s)]
*  cup, this resurgence, this, uh, let's get them back to the top year. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1792.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, like two years ago, cup was going like fourth overall in your drafts. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1797.3600000000001s)]
*  And now he's going 40th. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1801.72s)]
*  He's the same guy. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1803.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1805.3600000000001s)]
*  Once like the eight plus Lister receivers start going off the board, the value [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1806.1200000000001s)]
*  guys, those guys that, especially in the auctions, the guys you can grab for like [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1811.64s)]
*  15 bucks, nine bucks, 12 bucks, couple probably go, I think by the time we get [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1815.52s)]
*  to the season, people will probably. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1820.64s)]
*  Stip this out a little bit better. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1822.6s)]
*  There's been some Rams offensive line stuff already though. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1823.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1826.04s)]
*  As in bad stuff or good stuff. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1827.24s)]
*  I thought that was like some shaky stuff in the preseason and the training camp. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1828.84s)]
*  And they've already had a couple injuries. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1832.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1833.88s)]
*  And, but McVay has continued to reinvent himself. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1834.32s)]
*  McVay is the best coach in the league, in my opinion, he from the offense, they [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1837.28s)]
*  were running three years ago is like completely different from what they're [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1841.48s)]
*  doing now. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1843.6s)]
*  They've completely switched up the way they run the ball. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1843.9599999999998s)]
*  They're going to be like way heavier this year, more tight end, two tight end [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1846.28s)]
*  sets, they were used to be 11 personnel completely. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1848.84s)]
*  So I think it's just going to be Puka and cup on the field with two tight ends a lot. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1851.76s)]
*  Who is your number one stay away for 2024? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1856.28s)]
*  That's actually going to get highly drafted or bought. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1859.6399999999999s)]
*  Who's your, who's on your DND list? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1863.1999999999998s)]
*  Jamar chase. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1867.7199999999998s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1869.7199999999998s)]
*  I don't want anything to do with the Bengals and Joe Burrows wrist. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1871.32s)]
*  Joe, you can add Joe Burrow that list as well. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1874.1999999999998s)]
*  I, I, I'm with Craig. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1876.52s)]
*  He's not allowed to practice three straight days in a row. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1878.1599999999999s)]
*  He's not allowed to throw the football three straight days in a row. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1883.8s)]
*  Heifetz has been joking about this. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1886.36s)]
*  He's like, I will draft Joe Burrow when he throws a football for five straight days. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1887.6s)]
*  Yeah, that seems like a fair request. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1892.4399999999998s)]
*  He, he ain't wrong. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1894.04s)]
*  There's no quarterback or pitcher in the history of sports that has suffered the [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1895.48s)]
*  same injury Burrow has it's only lineman. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1899.52s)]
*  Where do you stand on Caleb? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1903.6s)]
*  Uh, I think I'm, I'm a little bit in on Caleb. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1906.12s)]
*  We were talking about teams like trying to find this year's Texans. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1908.1999999999998s)]
*  I think, I think the bears are in play there. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1911.0s)]
*  I think they have a sneaky, good offensive line. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1913.76s)]
*  I think they have a sneaky, good defense. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1915.76s)]
*  Above average offensive line and some weapons. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1917.28s)]
*  Oh, I mean, he has the best supporting cast of any rookie since I don't know when. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1919.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1924.8799999999999s)]
*  Did you watch hard knocks this week? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1925.36s)]
*  No, I actually haven't yet. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1927.04s)]
*  How was it? [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1928.08s)]
*  I'm not going to say I want to have this conversation with you again. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1929.1599999999999s)]
*  After you've watched hard knocks. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1932.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1933.84s)]
*  I have an opinion. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1934.4399999999998s)]
*  I'm not going to say, I'm not going to say anything. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1935.6799999999998s)]
*  I just want you to watch. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1937.6799999999998s)]
*  That sounds ominous to me. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1938.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1938.9599999999998s)]
*  It doesn't have to be ominous. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1939.24s)]
*  It could be I'm all the way in. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1940.6s)]
*  It was incredible. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1943.1599999999999s)]
*  This dude is a born leader. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1944.48s)]
*  They're a bad ass. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1946.1599999999999s)]
*  April Flus is a genius. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1947.6799999999998s)]
*  Wait till you see his daughters. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1949.28s)]
*  It's going to be a wonderful experience. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1951.1999999999998s)]
*  Or it could be, this is going to be a train wreck. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1953.84s)]
*  He's a midget. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1956.8s)]
*  Uh, his accuracy is questionable. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1957.8799999999999s)]
*  It could go either way. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1960.6399999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1961.9199999999998s)]
*  But check out. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1962.52s)]
*  Check out coach coach April Flus' daughters. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1963.4399999999998s)]
*  That's all. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1965.56s)]
*  Now I have only fans. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1967.12s)]
*  I have the giants on my DND list this year. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1968.8799999999999s)]
*  And I, I, I'm fully aware of all the neighbor stuff that's happening. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1972.04s)]
*  I've seen the clips. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1975.1999999999998s)]
*  He's incredible, but that's almost more of a reason that cause neighbors is going [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1976.04s)]
*  to be in the higher real estate camp. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1980.84s)]
*  And I just don't trust dimes at all. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1983.0s)]
*  And, um, I'm staying away from the entire team. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1984.84s)]
*  Like I said, avoid all wide receivers with shitty quarterbacks. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1988.4399999999998s)]
*  There's nothing worse than just praying that if your guys open your quarterback [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1991.4s)]
*  can even get him the ball. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1994.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, and plus the shitty quarterback can hurt the receiver. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1995.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1999.24s)]
*  But I've been leading him over the middle so he can get annihilated. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=1999.8000000000002s)]
*  Correct. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2002.88s)]
*  Talk me out of it. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2003.16s)]
*  My DND list player. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2003.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2005.88s)]
*  Travis Kelsey. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2006.52s)]
*  I agree with it. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2008.64s)]
*  I mean, he's basically said I only care about January. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2009.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2013.2s)]
*  They're keeping him on ice because he completely took off last year in the [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2013.52s)]
*  playoffs he did, he hurt his ankle in his knee early on in the year. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2016.52s)]
*  But so he, I think he kind of took his foot off the gas. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2020.52s)]
*  I think the chiefs really want to win this. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2023.5600000000002s)]
*  I think they are set on this is their year. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2025.4s)]
*  They're going to give everything they have this year to win this third [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2028.0400000000002s)]
*  Superbowl in a row and then Travis Kelsey might retire. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2030.16s)]
*  So I don't, he's not my number one tight end off the board. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2032.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2036.8400000000001s)]
*  But look, I mean, even a Travis Kelsey year, that's an eight out of 10. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2037.0800000000002s)]
*  He's still a top three guy. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2041.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2043.0s)]
*  Can I polish off one last fantasy take before we go? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2043.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2046.88s)]
*  Tight end boom. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2047.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2049.64s)]
*  There used to be a time when there was like two good tight ends and then five [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2050.7999999999997s)]
*  guys you could live with. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2055.3599999999997s)]
*  And then if you didn't, now you're in the eight, nine, 10 camp. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2056.56s)]
*  And all of a sudden you just have this dude who's going to get 47 catches for [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2059.64s)]
*  540 yards and four TDs and you just want to trade for one of the expensive fed ends. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2063.52s)]
*  There's so many options this year. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2068.7599999999998s)]
*  You even think like somebody like Musgrave on green Bay. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2070.7999999999997s)]
*  Like I liked that guy when he was out there and he was healthy. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2073.08s)]
*  Uh, Njoka was awesome last year. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2076.0s)]
*  Kincaid on Buffalo, Friar Muth on Craig Steelers. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2078.24s)]
*  McBride was a stud. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2082.68s)]
*  Hockinson, Andrews, people like, uh, Andrews is back up in Baltimore, Laporta, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2084.72s)]
*  Kelsey Kiddle, like to me, it's like the, the, the days of I need to get an [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2090.64s)]
*  awesome tight end, I'll spend 20 to 25 bucks. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2095.88s)]
*  Like those days are over. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2098.48s)]
*  You don't need to do that. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2099.44s)]
*  In my opinion. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2100.32s)]
*  I agree. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2101.24s)]
*  I mean, like Brock Bowers, the rookie out of Georgia is like the best [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2101.92s)]
*  tight end prospect ever. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2104.6s)]
*  And he's not even the top 10 guy out of drafts. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2105.72s)]
*  So I just see that the Raiders released their first depth chart for offense. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2108.44s)]
*  And they just, they're going full 12. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2112.16s)]
*  They're like, here's our four tight ends and here's our four receivers. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2114.7599999999998s)]
*  And they were just like, this is who we're going to be this year, guys. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2118.2799999999997s)]
*  Just FYI. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2121.0s)]
*  So Bowers and Maier are going to start and play big minutes. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2121.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2125.32s)]
*  All these tight ends. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2125.6s)]
*  I, we were talking about it on the fantasy show. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2126.64s)]
*  It's like, all these guys are freak receivers now. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2128.72s)]
*  And it's like how we were comparing it to NBA. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2131.24s)]
*  It's like all these big guys started learning how to dribble and [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2133.08s)]
*  shoot like 10 years ago. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2134.96s)]
*  And it's kind of the same way now with all these tight ends. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2136.36s)]
*  It used to be like, there was a couple of freaks who were like wide receivers [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2138.16s)]
*  and blockers, and now most of them are just pseudo wide receivers. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2141.44s)]
*  It's like every tight end now, Kyle Pitts is a receiver. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2144.72s)]
*  I'll tell you who I'm not taking. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2149.04s)]
*  Travis Kelsey. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2150.4s)]
*  Kyle Pitts is, Kyle Pitts is on my lifetime DND. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2151.08s)]
*  He really, really hurt my feelings. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2154.2799999999997s)]
*  I thought about putting him on this list. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2156.4s)]
*  He's close. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2157.7999999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2158.48s)]
*  Never again. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2159.44s)]
*  Never again. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2161.24s)]
*  Can't do it. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2162.04s)]
*  I think I spent 30 bucks on him two years ago. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2162.56s)]
*  His stock will never be lower. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2166.16s)]
*  Well, he's not going to be on my team. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2168.16s)]
*  All right, Craig, listen to the Ringer fantasy football show. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2169.96s)]
*  It's an excellent podcast. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sldsWuKdc&t=2172.2799999999997s)]
