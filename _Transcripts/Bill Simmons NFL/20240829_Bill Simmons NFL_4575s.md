# NFC OverUnders with Cousin Sal  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [August 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXYnpTEt3EU)
*  Alright, Sal. Here we go. You've been dreading this all summer.
*  The NFC East for the annual
*  Bill and Sal over under podcast.
*  We'll start with Philadelphia. This is the most defensive. I was thinking about it. This might be the most I'm rooting for the Cowboys since the
*  Romo years. I'm so defensive about this Cowboys team and the the love for the Eagles and
*  Alright, we can get to it. I just don't know. Let's start with Dallas then even though they have the second best odds because that's stupid
*  So many people were betting their under during the summer that it went from ten and a half to nine and a half
*  They made history. I can only remember like three times in the last 20 years the over under for a team
*  They actually had to move it. They never want to move it
*  They always want to keep the juices. The masses are asses as Thomas Jefferson or someone important like that once. Did he say that about sports betting?
*  I don't remember him being a big gambler
*  Over now nine and a half wins which has some juice on it minus 144 for the division there plus 175 conference 8 to 1
*  playoffs
*  196 to make it minus
*  plus
*  158 not to make it number one seed plus 800
*  You can go for the year from hell for the Cowboys under seven half wins alt adjusted plus 320. Let's do that
*  Why would you do that last year? They're 12 and five
*  Yeah, and then the playoff started and they turned into the Cowboys the last 48 to 32. Okay got the green bay thing going
*  We're doing over unders. All right, we're doing
*  Regular season see if Dallas wins 10 games you win knee-over
*  Sign me up
*  Sign me up. There's games awesome means playoffs
*  36 wins over the last three years you're going 12 12 and 12 now all of a sudden you're gonna go under
*  Why because the Eagles are better like we signed our blue chipper CD lamp. That's the scariest player in the division
*  Maybe in the conference if McCaffrey's hurt. I love what they're doing Mike Zimmer's the DC
*  You know and I get it people are freaked out because it's been 21 years since you've had a repeat winner
*  But I don't understand all this hatred for Dak. He puts up 4,200 4,500 yards
*  How many would they want in the row at home like 16 games or something crazy and in the in the regular season?
*  16 straight at home talk me out of this. I don't know why you know, I don't know why we're going on there
*  You think there's hatred for Dak?
*  I would I would say it's gone the other way and he's been quietly the most overrated quarterback in the league
*  Quietly overrated. Yeah, because he doesn't win playoff games. We usually try to judge our quarterbacks by that
*  We gotta figure out what we're doing it. We're doing over unders are we doing what happens in?
*  Regular season that we didn't think also why don't you go this crazy about Lamar? Well, you love the Ravens the month
*  It's the same situation and January really Lamar's 10 points at all
*  58 and 19 is the starter Dak was second in MVP votes last year. Like what let's look people are dumb put them up there
*  So the case for it you got a new rookie left tackle
*  Gaitan mm-hmm. You have high-end talent you could argue you might have the best receiver in the conference
*  Mm-hmm, and the best defensive player in the conference, right? You have a franchise quarterback
*  That's about it I'm out of a matter of positives negatives you have the worst running backs in the league now
*  I know we've discounted the running back position and we should you know, it's like we we can find anybody
*  Go after our punter too
*  If you want you have the Pats backup running back as your starter from 2023 now is your starter Z go it
*  Blans out for eight weeks. That wasn't great. Not great six to eight weeks
*  But for those quarterbacks are not great and those for six weeks, but go ahead Dak
*  Contract fiasco. I'm gonna say that's you never solved it and you some of the dumbest caps based stuff
*  I think we've seen the last ten years with this team where it's like
*  We don't you're just telling me how great that is then why didn't your guy give him a contract
*  Well, we get him after his leg injury. So I don't know why like yeah
*  But the way it's structured the cap hit for him this season is like suicidal, right?
*  Like it's it's almost as bad as like Denver getting rid of Russell Wilson and just taking the hit
*  All right, you're not deflecting any of it Jerry over pays
*  But it's a little bit of a problem when you got a quarterback a wide receiver and an edge rusher who want to be the
*  Top who are you to make a hundred and fifty million?
*  They all want to be the top paid at their position. So what do you what do you kind of have to do here?
*  Doesn't seem sustainable. I
*  Was saying on the pot a couple days ago that I do think we're gonna look back at this cap era where people are paying
*  Yeah, three guys crazy amounts of money and being like well we got to and I think the the returns on it are gonna be pretty
*  Dicey because you just you're taking away so much from other positions to pay the three dudes. There's more stuff
*  I don't like
*  Mike McCarthy lame Ducks has there been a lamer duck season you the owner
*  Comes out and says like yeah, I kind of like people in a contract here puts a little pressure on him
*  Like he's poo pooing the possibility of a and you have Bella check near Mike Vrabel just looming
*  Over the entire season the moment things go wrong, which you know, you're at Cleveland week one. It's a it's a
*  Not that hard first four weeks at Giants on a Thursday night and then kicks in with at Pittsburgh Detroit
*  Bye week at San Fran at Atlanta. It's always home Philly. They always on Houston
*  It's a lot of good games always teams gunning for them
*  Oh, you got seven seven nine one o'clock afternoon game. Yep
*  Including two Thursdays tough stretch in mid-october. I agree gets a little easier near the end
*  I'm going under okay. I'm sorry. I'm leaving Kyle. Take my microphone
*  I'm so insulted by this. I really am and it's not it's less with Dallas
*  I have one team coming out of this division and it's not Dallas
*  All right. I have there are other divisions. I like more. It's not you. It's me. Okay
*  I just I think you're worried about the wrong things who cares if it's Rico Dowdle or like a running back
*  What's the threshold if you get?
*  Like he's not gonna get two touchdowns in 400 yards a running back now
*  If he if he or she gets 800 yards and six touchdowns
*  female running back lots of female look at your team
*  800 yards six touchdowns is the threshold like why are we going crazy is Barkley?
*  There's any running back scare you other than McCaffrey you you literally have you have one skill position guy plus Jake Ferguson
*  Yeah, but the but your second third receivers among the worst in the league
*  You're running back hundred yards no matter what probably worse than the league offensive line is in the worst shape
*  It's been this decade right it's like a B minus now used to be like an a sure a or an a plus
*  Yeah, be that's a is gone B minus is probably fair
*  defense
*  The Lawrence Parsons combo got that still D back should be good other blends out. I
*  Don't Zimmer for Quinn
*  I think he's more suited for this defense to to look over it the last time we saw the defense they were getting absolutely
*  Video-game torched right by the Packers, so why why are they better?
*  What's what's different? Why will you love the Ravens despite their pitiful playoff performances?
*  But when we do over unders we have to crap all over the Cowboys. I'm so defensive
*  I'm so defensive as you know I'm a narrative guy. Yeah, I've been accused of it over the years
*  Yeah, it feels
*  Lame duck McCarthy guys looming you know going right. I just use a lame duck glass. I just don't like the vibe all right
*  Bet under watch what happens well. I am taking the end of this well
*  Don't go crawling to me for money when that happens. Don't you dare do it?
*  Philadelphia there over is 10 and F wins. Oh yeah Dallas used to be 10 and F wins until so many people bet it
*  They had to adjust it
*  Minus 148 so juice on the over division minus 140 which has been they were plus division right was that
*  Wasn't Dallas the favorite for a little while yeah, and then it flipped
*  Oh, he's the favorite now like the AFC's minus stranger for the playoffs
*  You can get him plus 450 for the one seed and I completely agree
*  It's been too much of a shift toward Philly people throwing away
*  You know what happened down the stretch last year 11 and 6 they lost six of their last seven they got killed by Baker Mayfield
*  Mm-hmm the chemistry was so bad ESPN
*  Didn't even wait till the week usually it's a week of the new season when they write the whole piece about all the bad chemistry
*  They didn't do that. They did the serrani-hertz giant feature about it two weeks ago. I
*  Like some of the stuff they did I
*  Think they're better like they brought in Fangio who I you know their coaching situation last year was pretty grim on both sides of the ball
*  Say Kwan Barkley
*  Angry the Giants gave up on him they flipped reddick
*  Who's holding out now and seems like a like I got on the nose with that dudes doing and they brought huh from the Jets
*  I don't know why the judge just didn't keep puff, but that was that was good
*  spent a bunch of
*  free agent money and capital on D backs and strengthen that and
*  Their offensive line. I know they lost Jason Kelsey, but it's still a good offensive line
*  It's still massive and I think hurts was hurt last year. That's the other thing I gen it I had him
*  I had hurts futures. I had him on both fantasy teams that dude was not fucking healthy for the last two-thirds of the year
*  Then I well I can't say anything but you know, but they lost six out of the last seven I get it
*  But I also took Jacksonville in our AFC part and they died too down. I appreciate that
*  I'm just saying and their GM is the best in the game. He really does he plays his Jedi mind tricks
*  They got they got the receiver out of Washington. They got Dotson for nothing
*  They knew when to get rid of reddick who might not play football again as you may have awesome receivers
*  Barkley is good for them. Barkley's a top six running back. Okay, like I never like the score from the three-yard line
*  Anyway, it doesn't matter with the tush push. I want to have a lot of time. You're gonna say he's injured
*  I want to know why they went one and six down the stretch and if you listen to Jason Kelsey and some of these guys
*  Interviewed that you read between the lines. They're like these teams figure this out, right?
*  49ers figured us out the zero blitz kills hurts, you know, yeah
*  We're kind of kind of showing our our plan right there to them. They went, you know, they had a weird
*  I know the loser and the Super Bowl is supposed to drop off a little bit, but it didn't work that way
*  They had such a good first half and then it eventually kicked then it kicked in. It was weird
*  They went from 70 sacks to 43. They weren't the defensive force that they were
*  I think ten and a half is way too high much like it is with Cincinnati
*  I'm going under here and I don't think they make the playoffs and I know I know I'm biased it
*  So how about this? I think we're both right?
*  I think one of these teams doesn't make the playoffs and I'm gonna say it's Philly and you say
*  I mean, I think it's Dallas doesn't make you think Philly doesn't make all right
*  We're both right good, but I think one team comes out of this division
*  One of these teams is gonna be a letdown one of these teams is gonna be the one every year
*  There's a first take team where first take starts and it's the thing on the bottom is like can Philly sees it be saved
*  Right what's wrong in Dallas and it's gonna be one of these two teams and I just don't know which one it is
*  All right. I told you which one it was if you want listen, it's fine. I think it's gonna be your team
*  I don't know what the Saquon I'm so down on running backs, but they just don't scare me
*  You hear like Saquon's coming to town. Like I don't know. Would you?
*  Say we've never we're going from seeing Saquon with terrible quarterbacks and no offensive line to Saquon with a good office
*  Is it good? I mean add this Juergens is replacing Kelsey's at like 45 snaps at center
*  I get it, but this center and I know Jason Kelsey was awesome and he was the leader of the team
*  He was basically ordering people around. I know how good he was. Yeah, but the center position
*  It does seem like the center gets hurt and they're like they've moved the left guard to center and they're still fine
*  Like yeah, I it's both important and unimportant depending on the team
*  I refuse to believe that just cuz they don't have Jason Kelsey the Eagles offense gonna fall apart
*  Yeah, like they have two awesome receivers. Mm-hmm
*  They have a top six running back and their quarterback two years ago was one driveway from winning the Super Bowl
*  Okay, unlike your guy. I don't know what to say my guy doesn't make it
*  But the Eagles scored nine points in a playoff game and everyone's like no no, they're back. They're gonna win 12 games
*  All right
*  Well one thing we can agree on neither of us probably like the rest of this division
*  I really really wanted to get Washington into the playoffs as one of my playoff teams
*  They fit all the criteria new coach theory. They had the run Rivera be enemy combo just legendary bad coaching
*  They brought in Dan Quinn who's not new rock me, but he's competent and better and you had him and he's solid
*  Jaden Daniels
*  Seems like he's gonna be able to play right away 24 years old. There's some good bets with him
*  Yeah, I think he's six to one to be offensive rookie of the year and Caleb's plus 120 and you know
*  They might they might have a good offense
*  They're over six and a half. I
*  Feel pretty good about going over on it
*  Playoffs plus 310 is where where I got off the train
*  They're four and 13 last year and it just seems realistic to me. They had a lot of draft picks new coach
*  Jaden Daniels over Sam Howe who's a turnover sack machine
*  They had a couple lines they got added Wagner and Luevo
*  Their turnover differential last year was minus 14, which was the absolute worst and the biggest thing is the organization
*  New owner comes in brings in Adam Peters and a whole bunch of people
*  They actually like are trying to care about the right things unlike last year where it was like just the poison factory
*  Yeah, so the vibes will be good. I like the poison just don't think they have enough talent
*  They have to rename the stadium the poison factor. Yeah, I just couldn't get there from a talent standpoint. They don't uh
*  Like if you're just looking at like kick-ass guys and even let's say Daniels is a kick-ass rookie QB. Yeah, McLaurin's good
*  Josh Allen Luevo Wagner. It's it's not a long list. I just don't think they have enough talent to make the playoffs
*  I like the over I had to take a chance on someone and I did it with the Raiders in the AFC
*  This is my playoff team in the NFC. I know Joe. Hey, I try else hates my team
*  I know and I just think Jaden Daniels gonna be so good
*  I'm gonna take that six to one to an offensive the rookie of the year and I'm right sitting right here
*  Gave out the offensive the rookie of the year last year. So I'm gonna hit it again. It's a great bet. It's
*  It's one of those we look at stuff that it's like we talked about Jacksonville in the AFC thing where it's just like people just
*  Aren't on it and there's been so much Caleb buzz and he's on hard knocks. He's the number one pick
*  Oh my god, what an incredible situation like Bryce Young last? Yeah, same thing and day and even if he's good Daniels might be even better
*  He is a special talent bill
*  This is a very special kind of talent and I think with Cliff Kingsbury in there
*  Yeah, offensive coordinator not head coach bring him in there. I think he's right there
*  He has three road games Daniels in his first four. So it's gonna be a little bit of a learning curve
*  But they're winnable Tampa Bay Giants Cincinnati and Arizona. I think they're gonna be the team like what's going on with Washington
*  This is our G3 all over again. He better be careful. I was running all over the place
*  Yeah, that kind of thing took a couple guys away from the Cowboys are gonna be productive
*  So Armstrong and Fowler and they're playing dimes. They're playing dimes twice. Yeah playing Watson
*  Bryce Young Russell Wilson Levis
*  Carr and Baker Mayfield so the case against them and why I didn't want to take them is their defense on
*  Paper what they were last year
*  There's no scenario where if you're if you're saying who are the four worst defenses in the league not the conference
*  Washington has to be mentioned and
*  I just don't think their defense is good enough to get to ten wins
*  But the fact that they play a bunch of like crap or mediocre quarterbacks would help them
*  I just don't think they have the defense the offense. I think I think their destiny is gonna be the red zone team
*  They're gonna be super fun
*  Cornel have an awesome year Daniels have some scrambles and that's kind of yeah who they'll end up being
*  I guess I think they win these coin flip games more than they lose them
*  So but you're right that past defense was bad. I think they allowed 35 touchdowns the defenses
*  I don't know who has a worse defense
*  Like honestly who has a worse defense?
*  It's Arizona Arizona's not great. Yeah
*  Giants might not be great Tennessee. Maybe I mean, yeah
*  One of the first ones mentioned so they're at Tampa week one and then home Giants week two and
*  If they could somehow beat Tampa then they're going at since a week three a team that I like less than you
*  But there's a kid they'd have to add Arizona. No, I don't like since it neither of us like since yeah, right? Yeah
*  Yeah, so that I think they were first three games
*  I think they would have to go three and one coming out of those first four. Yeah to realistically be that's gonna
*  Have teams all their Philly Dallas games are later
*  They have
*  Philly week 11 at Philly week 12 home Dallas and then week 16 Philly
*  Twice last year and they always seem if they like to play them but
*  Yeah, I just I didn't see enough talent on their side. I bet we agree in the Giants. They're over a six and a half
*  I don't know why it's six and a half. I can't really come up with any reasons
*  Plus 116 if you want to go over minus 142 for the under worst record plus 850
*  You could go under four and a half wins adjusted plus 235
*  Last year six and eleven they allowed 85 sacks. They somehow had the worst offensive line
*  Yeah in the division when Washington's offensive line was getting their quarterbacks almost killed
*  they traded for Brian Burns and one of the weird trades of the year where they
*  Paid a second rounder to get him and they could have just signed somebody in free hc if they wanted to pass rush and
*  They added neighbors who I think everybody loves but he has a bottom three quarterback
*  In the league. Yeah
*  Danny dimes with the veto is the backup still there and they lost Barkley. I
*  Don't see any scenario where this team gets to six wins
*  Seven we agree on this one. Did you watch the hard knocks the Giants one? I
*  Didn't I liked it better than the Bears one even I know it went back to March and everything
*  But you see the inner workings of the front office and everything and it was fun
*  How they tried desperately to trade up with the Patriots to get that, you know, I'm glad you brought this up
*  They wanted a quarter how don't turn the tick-tock camera
*  What I was on I was on some threads about this because they offered the Pats
*  First second and third rounders in 24, right?
*  But then in 25 to right and that was their offer
*  So maybe the Pats could have even gotten like a second rounder in 26 or something
*  It's a pretty big haul man because you think sure they could have they could have gone down to six and let's say they took
*  They took one of the left tackles late them or all and I forget who is available, right?
*  It's just like all right
*  At least now we have our franchise left tackle
*  Then they went out one of the top picks in the second round one of the top picks in the third round
*  But then going forward for this year
*  You'd have the Giants number one pick and the Giants would have taken Drake may who wouldn't been able to play this year with no
*  Offensive line right right and then you have the top three pick plus the Pats were gonna be bad plus
*  plus two top picks in the second and third rounds like
*  The moral is Drake may better be fucking good because that was that was a lot
*  And you have a sign pile on that you're gonna want to do there. It is the same pile ons right over there
*  I love Drake may but he may and he better be good because that was like to be able to have two first-round picks from
*  The Giants plus two seconds and two-thirds. That's a shit. Loach. Oh Shane
*  You could tell how disappointed he was when the Patriots like no
*  We're good where we are and then then the neck whole next episode is convincing themselves that Danny Dimes is their man all
*  That Danny Dines. Yeah, he did it two years ago. That's what I love most about it, but yeah, you're right
*  I mean Dable lost 50 pounds. That's good. No, he did it. I don't some some people
*  I just like when I like heavier day. I don't like skinnier table. Yeah, I thought he I just like fingers angry and fat
*  Yeah, the main thing though. I really do think he's gonna be terrific like I'm in I'm all in but it was just it did make me
*  Yeah, make me blink. It's a lot. Yeah, it's a lot. They're passing up. But yeah, you're right
*  I I almost I don't know if I'm the last holdout with the Danny Dimes this good thing
*  I don't think that he's good, but I did want to blame the offensive line more than normal
*  You know because it was so atrocious for so many years and that's why the neighbors pick was kind of a waste I think
*  They they don't know what they're doing the Giants. Yeah, that's a that's a that's a at least a big part of it
*  What is your favorite prop from the NFC East?
*  Cowboys highest-scoring team 10 to 1 I won with it. Wow, they hit last year one with it last
*  So the case for it is they play the Giants in Washington four times
*  Which might be two of the worst defenses in the league and right I actually looked at that
*  They got like 170 points from those four games, I think our 172 crazy. Yeah, yeah
*  Yeah, I think there's only like three or four teams that can win this so they get 10
*  Wow, so this I mean this is gonna be a bigger fantasy year for Rico Doudel and
*  My god, I'm cooked and I thought and Zeke Elliott would kill for Dalvin cook you would kill for him
*  What other 2018 running backs can get why do you care about running? Can you get Tomlinson?
*  What's he doing?
*  You know our our concession stand guy is new too, I mean what what what do you care?
*  Running backs. Yeah, they never mattered who needs they have mattered. They don't any who needs anybody on a third and three
*  Okay, we my favorite
*  prop of all these props. Yeah is
*  Giants under four and F wins plus 235. Hmm
*  Rahim has been on this for a couple years that
*  The alt unders and the alt overs if you like a team really like them
*  If you really don't like a team really don't like them and just get two to one or three to one odds on it
*  Yeah versus just like banging. Well, I have a couple more later that qualify that too
*  But I don't see it the Giants fans hate Danny dimes
*  Yeah, they're gonna have no running game at all and neighbors by week five if he's even still playing because god only knows there would
*  You know dime sends one over the middle. Here's another one
*  Because you brought it up earlier plus 12 turnover ratio. That's probably not gonna continue for the Giants another reason they should be no way
*  All right. Well, we're not aligned again. We only have three divisions left to find some common ground moving on to the NFC North
*  Leading with the Detroit Lions, they're over unders ten and a half
*  juice on that minus 132 they are plus 130 to win the division which is kind of shocking because I thought they'd be a minus
*  plus 550 for the conference
*  12 to 1 for Super Bowl plus 480 for the number one seed plus 950 for best record
*  If you want to go 12 plus wins plus 152 if you want to go 13 plus wins
*  Plus 240 there 12 and 5 last year. Look at all the bold Wow
*  Look how much like I love the Lions me too. This is bad
*  I mean we could disagree on everything except I think we have the Lions winning the next six Super Bowls or something
*  So are the Lions better than last year when they were 12 and 5 I would argue yes the poor to healthy
*  The poor missed big chunk of the middle. What he missed a couple games. He's playing hurt
*  I forget but now he's healthy Gibbs is back. They signed DJ reader
*  They tried to beef up the D backs
*  Drafted some cornerbacks and just really tried to take care of that
*  Not a lot of weaknesses and then on top of it
*  14 out of 17 indoors, yeah, then play three outdoors games and only two cold weather. So it's all lined up for them
*  You go and then I'll go all right
*  Well, they were 12 and 5 last year and some people think they should be 13 and 4
*  I guess there was some shenanigans in that Cowboys game. I don't the game you cheated on
*  I don't remember it but let's let's give them
*  I mean if they won 13 and it's ten and a half
*  You're really gonna think they're regressing and I don't think they are they can't Campbell's team is built
*  Perfectly, right? So when you put the ball on the field, it might be different
*  But you said they had only those two cold weather games. They start Rams Tampa Bay at Arizona Seattle
*  Yeah, I don't think you have it written down but the last
*  Undefeated team I think is like seven to one or something looked at that like the Lions air five and one in prime time last year
*  They're not afraid of anyone. Yeah any situation Goff is still gonna be underrated. Like you said, they improved the secondary
*  I just like this team a lot. I really do they got the Alabama kid
*  They traded up in the first round Sewell's a top offensive lineman Ag now is a top center
*  They bring Zyler in top 12 guard
*  Yeah, I had their O line ranked this top top five O line and I think that's you have them go in the Super Bowl because I do
*  So I did some research on this I was trying to find some Lions doppelgangers
*  The 2024 Lions because they went 12 and 5 they had a three win jump from the year before right?
*  They won two playoff rounds and then they lost the conference
*  title game to Sam stupid 34 to 31 so came to him closest away, so other other teams that fit that profile
*  The 2019 Chiefs went 12 and 4 plus 2 they were one seed lost that stupid game to the pass
*  The D4 game the next year 12 and 4 2 seed won the Super Bowl. So there's one
*  the 2012 Seahawks
*  First year of Russell hustle and bustle
*  11 and 5 plus 4 wins that year
*  Five seed lost that tough one in round 2 to Atlanta where they took the lead and then Atlanta had the field goal at the end
*  Next year 13 and 3 one seed won the Super Bowl
*  Year before San Francisco 13 and 3 the first Harbor year plus 5
*  Two seed lost that really tough game in round 2 to the Giants by 3 next year
*  11 4 and 1 2 seed lost the Super Bowl to Baltimore the game we went to the blackout game
*  They are down 3 inside the 5 so they were right there, but they were right there
*  And then the last one I had this is a weird one, but the O's 05 Bears
*  11 and 5 plus 6 2 seed lost to Carolina around 2 like that crazy game 29 21
*  And then the next year 13 and 3 once he lost the Super Bowl to Indy 17 to 29
*  Because they lost I put their score first, but so the case would be the teams that you did your homework
*  The teams that jumped yeah, and then had a tough playoff loss
*  But not too damaging and then came back strong and not a Super Bowl loss because the Super Bowl lost because that's a different category
*  But they got the taste but now they're right. I had a tough game
*  But they got the taste but now they're right I have them winning everything and the play the whole thing
*  I think they win the Super Bowl interesting have the bills over the Lions
*  But I have the Lions over the Houston Texans in the Super Bowl is my Super Bowl pick
*  and
*  I love it
*  Everything went their way like even Ben Johnson staying right their offensive coordinator who?
*  Who did a great job, and it's like well. They're definitely gonna lose him now that'll suck
*  They're gonna lose him and Aaron Glenn guess what they didn't lose either of them. They kept their awesome coordinators
*  So you have them and Campbell this is probably a top four coaching staff that I think they have the fewest holes
*  That's that's the thing that's what I kept coming back to do and they can score and they lose
*  It's fine, then what if Jameson Williams is good, right?
*  So I'm all in I love the only thing that worries me about this team is just that Green Bay's in the same division
*  and whatever Green Bay ceiling is but
*  We're gonna know pretty early because they have the Rams at home on a Sunday night
*  Home Tampa at Arizona and then home Seattle heading into a bye that feels like 4-0
*  Yep at Dallas week 5 that'll be the game of the week at Minnesota
*  home, Tennessee
*  Possible 7-0 heading into at Green Bay at Houston week 9 week 10
*  And I think I think there's a chance there's 7-0 heading into those. I love it. I'm trying to find that
*  You know last
*  Undefeated team thing. It's gotta be 7-1 or better
*  So to your point about the Lions the last undefeated bet they have the best odds on Fandl plus 650
*  Niners are plus 750 eagles 10 to 1 Chiefs 10 to 1 Miami 12 to 1 Bengals 14 to 1
*  Still good. I'm just typing that down on that. That's a great one. Let's get on a flight to Arizona
*  That in you know the other thing I
*  Was trying to think as you know I've said it before in the pot. I'm a narrative guy. Oh, yeah
*  It's the most fun if the Lions are really good and actually have a chance to win the Super Bowl
*  It'd be fucking amazing. They've won anything since 1957. It's kind of why I put the bills on the other side
*  So it's like a no no no see this. That's a crafty handicap. Yeah, I'm not a narrative guy
*  I'm I would never hear that yes, but maybe you are deep down in one of my good friends is a narrative guy
*  So I I've learned a lot
*  Narratives so Lions bills yeah three like we almost got it last year
*  Lions bills like four weeks after the new president takes office
*  It feels like the this could be the end of the world that could be it
*  I'm gonna buy some soup today
*  Soup and some chef priority ravioli that lasts for three years better bet that to holy macro
*  Hold on to your fucking seats Lions bills. I wish I had picked that I have Lions Texans
*  It'll probably end up being Lions chiefs, but
*  But yeah, I think this Lions teams really good night and
*  Honestly, they probably could have won the Super Bowl last year. Yeah, if they somehow steal that Niners. Yeah, yeah
*  Ridiculous. All right, let's talk Green Bay
*  Over is nine and a half wins the most suspicious over under on either side of the conference. I have no idea
*  Why isn't this ten and a half Vegas own last year?
*  They started two and five and then they went seven and three down the stretch finished nine and eight that includes one of the worst
*  losses of the year that Bryce Young game that I think all of us got annihilated. Yeah, it was the one good Panthers game, but
*  Some of their odds plus 200 for the division plus 800 for the conference minus
*  158 for the playoffs which feels like that's a nice one to throw in a parlay with somebody else
*  I find it hard to believe there wouldn't be a playoff team. You can go 12 plus wins for plus 250
*  Last year they beat Dallas in round one lost in round two to San Francisco by three a game
*  They probably should have won. They're better at safety. They signed McKinney. They drafted a couple people new defensive coordinator
*  They're gonna have better injury luck. The injury luck was terrible last year. It's a young team that has a lot of talent
*  They did lose Aaron Jones. They added Josh Jacobs, but very young
*  I think there's seven receivers make as much as CD land and I think they have the most popular
*  four person wide receiver core
*  Most popular well just like people are in on the Packers receivers Watson and Dobbs
*  Yeah, and people like they like those dudes the case against them is everybody likes them. Mm-hmm
*  And that's really it. Yeah, that's it. It's like it seems too easy
*  They played so good. It was so hard to get an interception out of that guy last year. Yeah, it was like
*  18 touchdowns one interception over those last seven games, but I do want to say this
*  October 29th 2023 the Vikings beat them 24 10 love is 24 for 41
*  There's one of those games where we threw one interception
*  But could have had four if you could what were the live odds on Jordan love becoming the highest paid player in football history
*  Six months later. Yeah. Yes from there like he's good. I like this team
*  I'm betting them over but how many games you have to win to be the highest paid in history
*  He won ten games. Can you win five games and be the highest paid ever? So this is really good
*  It's very I know it's very strange. I don't see a lot of holes either. They start in Brazil against Philly
*  Indy at Tennessee and Minnesota
*  Can I test drive a theory for you about that Brazil game? Sure
*  And I was thinking of doing this for the Tuesday pod before the season starts
*  Because you know in fantasy we had the DND do not draft less. Yeah
*  I'm gonna I think I'm gonna do like a little mini manifesto for myself of just things
*  I'm not allowing myself to do this year and one of them is to just not bet on any of the overseas games. Oh
*  Brazil London
*  Germany, I think I'm just out. I think it's it's too random too many weird things happen
*  I never feel good about it the time zone and something's always weird about it and I'm never like oh
*  Man I'm so glad I bet that London game that was so much fun. It's never fun. It always sucks. It's always weird. Yeah
*  And I might just be out do you I you don't like this because you'll bet on anything
*  No, you're betting on Korean tennis this summer. How dare you you weren't you weren't been on Korean tennis Korean little league team
*  But no not tennis now. What are we we kind of did this with the Thursday night games, right?
*  We're right out of not out out but not the only thing where I settled on those Thursday games was putting them in
*  Kind of mild teases. Yeah to try to get a jump on the week
*  But not not to have too much on it right too stupid. Yeah, I remember that one game when fields just went bonkers
*  There was one Thursday night game. It was like fields his best game of the year
*  He just looked like he was Lamar across from Josh Allen
*  Yeah
*  There's a million examples and that seems to happen like eight times a year on Thursday night
*  We're just one team or the other just doesn't show up, but that's that's my point
*  I think the Thursday nights are more wonky than the at least everybody's on regular rest
*  That might have been my next manifesto thing is I might be out on Thursday nights unless it's like some sort of tea
*  That's fine because it's three days rest that makes sense
*  But I don't know the I don't think I'm not betting anyone after their biggest win of the year anymore
*  Yeah, when somebody goes in it's like, oh my god, and they're doing the interviews today. I'm out. I'm not betting them
*  I'm gonna make a list. I do think though it's overstated with the flying
*  Overseas and everything like because the planes are super nice. Okay, the only thing I take from
*  Philly flying to Brazil is Jaylen Hurts is definitely getting a nap on a Tuesday
*  What's wrong with that? Like he's definitely asleep on the plane for a few hours. So it's not a negative
*  Yeah, they're in these massive charter planes
*  so
*  This is an interesting one because Green Bay in week one that Brazil game on a Friday night
*  So there's all kinds of reasons not to bet it and I know I'm gonna bet it
*  But I do feel like that's gonna be the over usually the overreaction games on a Sunday and when we do the pot on Sunday
*  Nights and it's like, oh, here's the overreaction game this happened and what do we believe in this or not?
*  It's gonna be on a Friday this year because whoever loses that game is gonna be the overreaction team
*  Right if Green Bay loses like up told you mm-hmm young team not gonna happen
*  Same for Philly if Philly blows it and it's probably not gonna be close right which will lend more to it
*  It'll be like 38 to 10. Yeah
*  That's what we should do. I'm minus nine and a half both ways
*  they have a couple hard stretches in their schedule that made me nervous to like they have
*  They have four prime time in a row starting. Well, they have week seven week eight week nine Houston at Jacksonville home Detroit
*  I don't love that but then they go week 11 at Chicago home San Fran
*  Thursday night home Miami Thursday night at Detroit
*  Sunday at Seattle
*  Monday night home, New Orleans, that's fucking weird
*  foot like they don't play a normal Sunday afternoon game for
*  Five weeks. Yeah, it's a lot for this kid. I don't like I mean is the highest paid in the history of sports
*  Should be able to turn around I didn't mind who they lost in free agency Aaron Jones savage
*  And they really did need they've needed yeah, they needed a
*  Better defensive coordinator so they did that I'm just writing down lock for that
*  I'm locking in Green Bay over nine and a half. Okay, Chicago
*  Sexy a sexy overpick over is eight and a half wins so much juice on that
*  It's minus 160 which I think is the most juice of any of these overs sounds right division plus 340 playoffs plus 104
*  You could go 11 plus wins plus 210 you can zag the other way do under six and a half wins plus
*  320 they added Caleb Williams and they added the first and ninth picks in the draft the doons a and Caleb sure they
*  added Keenan Allen
*  They have three really really high-end receivers
*  Running backs are worse
*  Pass rush 100% worse. So is there a pass rush? No that
*  Offensive line not great. I
*  Couldn't get there
*  You went under yeah, I went under Wow. We must be the only ones we agree
*  Too many people on it and that's next. It's a fixed line boy
*  I'll take the plus money all the time totally
*  Right. I mean one was a rookie
*  What was the last time a rookie quarterback was expected to be over 500 or make the playoffs?
*  What'd you say to make the playoffs was even? Yeah, pretty much. Yeah, I
*  Don't see it. He could be eight and nine and have a good year, right and they have
*  They have the staff is kind of easy
*  Yeah, but then that all of a sudden like from week 13 on at Detroit on a Thursday night
*  Yeah at San Fran at Minnesota on a Monday night three weeks in a row. Mm-hmm
*  Right as the QB hitting the rookie wall part of the season home Detroit right after that home Seattle on a Thursday
*  So they go home Detroit home Seattle four days later, and then they finish at Green Bay
*  That's a fucking gauntlet
*  I mean that's that feels like one and five to me so they would have to be six of final eight against the division
*  Yeah, that's that's a lot. Yes, and then they have some other like all of their road games at Houston at Indy
*  They're playing the Jaguars in London at Arizona. I
*  Don't see it. I like to for them to go nine and eight. I would be really impressed
*  I really wanted to get there with them because I needed a new playoff team and I just couldn't yeah new offensive new defensive
*  Coordinator just a lot of new pieces coming in and out and I don't think they're ready
*  Like the the fans are more excited than the team's gonna be good. I think right and what do we know about Iber fluce?
*  What have we seen that got anyone excited? He's okay. I don't know
*  I think like he's seems like he's fine if you want to talk about I think here's a better bet
*  For him to win coach of the year is 10 to 1 because if they make the playoffs what you get for even odds
*  Whatever, but Iber fluce they make the playoffs. I think he's gonna win
*  Coach of the year and he'll have gone from three wins to seven wins
*  Right to ten or whatever eleven so
*  That to me is a better bet if you're pro bears, but I'm just not I loved
*  Jim Harbaugh 10 to 1 they're both 10 to 1 right? Yeah, cuz that's like if the charges make the playoffs he's winning
*  Yeah, it's it's a wrap
*  Minnesota is seven and a half plus one thirty four if you want to go over on that they're begging you do it
*  They're under for seven up is minus 168 which I think is the highest juice on and under
*  Worst under five and a half wins is plus 176 if you want to do that worst record is 13 to 1
*  So they added Aaron Jones. That's a positive because their running backs were bad last year
*  By the way the case on your doesn't matter if you have good running backs
*  Look at Minnesota's running backs last year like they were awful. They killed them
*  Here's how they're worse. They had that Jordan Addison DUI thing that I think he might even get suspended during the season
*  Yeah
*  terrible terrible cornerbacks like the probably the worst cornerback situation in the conference and
*  then you know, they drafted JJ McCarthy with a top-10 pick and
*  I like the pick and it seems like he was doing well, but he got hurt
*  So now you're getting nothing. Yeah, you have this season where you get a top-10 pick. You get nothing from it
*  I don't like that and then cornerback their quarterback Sam Darnold who's just not good at football
*  Yeah, so to me this is an easy under I mean the offseason
*  Mojo McCarthy injury their third round pick died, right?
*  They had two DUIs one for Addison one for one of the coaches
*  They had a torn ACL for offensive lineman even this like Brian Flores stuff like the last couple weeks
*  We do it. That was like just weird stuff cursed all over the place
*  Which is weird because two years ago they won every one score game with cousins
*  So you would think the curse was gonna move around. This is just a lot to overcome
*  I don't know why you'd be expected to go get them to eight games, which is plus money if you go over
*  Yeah, that makes sense. Plus 134 for eight. Yeah, I'm going under here
*  They also led in forced fumbles last year something that goes back and forth every year. So
*  And they call Kevin O'Connell KOC. I don't know if you're alright with that
*  Is do they really they do? Yeah, we learned tape and I talked about that bullshit. Yeah, I know you got to call that out
*  So they have played London Jets in London, which is considered a home game
*  Would you see their first seven because they got that Giants they're at the Giants week one. Yeah
*  But then their home San Fran home Houston, then they're at Green Bay
*  Then they have to play the Jets in London
*  They get a bye week and then they have to play home Detroit at the Rams that could be either 0 and 7 or 1 and 6
*  I'm gonna recommend something that Giants Vikings game
*  Whoever loses that could be the worst or the last winless team. Mm-hmm
*  So jump on that. I think that's also around 10 to 1 someone there Giants
*  I'm gonna look that up while you give us your best NFC North prop. All right
*  Well, it's bears no playoffs it's not fun, but it's a minus 128 bears no playoffs
*  I just think there's more more in that division and offer
*  I don't think there's gonna be three but I do like our first to four
*  That's my favorite first to four in that division
*  Lions oh, that's our favorite bet. That's the best. What was that? We put that on the one six to one
*  So it has to go Lions Packers Bears Vikings exact order six to one
*  Yeah, so I'm not as confident in a one or four in any other division
*  I love the Lions coming first love the Vikings coming forth if you want to flip-flop the Bears and Packers
*  I don't recommend it
*  But I think that's seven to one so if you want to hit both of those and you me and Sal
*  I'm so you're Sal. Yeah. Yeah, he's a narrative guy. He's not a name guy
*  You you you be at house and hench. Yeah, we all jumped on that
*  We did a Detroit for the one seed. Yeah, that was five to one. We did a group bed on that
*  We've done pretty well in those group bets. Yeah
*  I'm fine with loading up on the trick is I think I think it's Super Bowl or bus for them
*  And I think they're ready for it. So okay last one this team by the way, New England five to one
*  Tennessee plus 750 Carolina plus 850 and Minnesota's plus 950. There's a lot of options
*  I don't think any of them are gonna win only two games
*  But I think everyone's gonna be right around that for win
*  You might be honest something with that Minnesota idea because they lose that Giants game go get it
*  They're not winning another game until week nine in the back. Yeah, they're not favored remotely in any of those games
*  That's a good one plus 950. All right, it's time for the NFC South
*  Sal have an announcement. Mm-hmm. The NFC South is back. Oh
*  You love this division. I forgot it hits back. It's so bad
*  This is an absolute all-timer of a train wreck
*  So least wins by a division the last five years last year NFC South 27 year before
*  2022 AFC South 23
*  21 was AFC South 28 which is pretty high actually
*  2020 NFC is 23 in
*  2019 NFC is 24. So the lowest number is 23 wins Wow for a division
*  And I think it could be in play with the with the NFC South
*  I'll do you one better or the same this will be if there's no 10 win team
*  This will be the first time a division failed to produce a double-digit win team three years in a row in the history of football
*  Wow, I mean the bigger question is could it produce a nine-win team? Yeah
*  We might have four under 500 teams
*  So the first one is Atlanta Atlanta's favorite to win the division of minus 145 and that's moved up, right? Wasn't it?
*  I think New Orleans was a little friskier before people realized that I can't wait. Well, they got Jude on they got a couple pieces
*  So they're over is nine and a half wins minus 142
*  They're 11 one for the conference
*  There were seven and ten last year and if you want to get frisky 12 plus wins is plus 240
*  New coach Raheem Morris, so they they're they do qualify for the new coach theory. They also qualify for the new quarterback theory
*  Yeah, because they went from Desmond Ritter was cut today. Yeah cut today
*  Yeah, see that's the thing with the Falcons and Jets the teams they had a quarter the guys had a quarterback last year
*  Either cut or third string. That's how bad it was
*  We'll see with cousins how he's moving they added Simmons and they added Jude on if you're gonna ding them on anything
*  They got nothing from the 24 draft
*  Like they spent the eighth pick on Penex got nothing out of it
*  Unless cousins gets hurt and their third round linebackers out for the year, right?
*  So only out of their draft where they had top eight picks in every round. They only ended up with one guy
*  What do they call it? Not the Milton Berle and just pull out enough to win?
*  But I feel like they're they're just toying with everything like yeah, we got this division
*  We don't even need a quarterback. We'll draft Penex right well, whatever we don't care about any of this stuff
*  We know we only have to win eight games to win and take it
*  So we have this is something we talked about with Raheem and JJ and house on our wise guys thread
*  They're minus 145 for the division
*  But it doesn't make sense to bet that until week four right because they start Pittsburgh
*  Which might have the best division the whole day in the the best defense in the whole league as we covered in the part
*  One at Philly and then Sunday night KC could be on three
*  They could be one and two or on three coming out of that and then it gets fucking easy
*  They have a really easy stretch from week four to week seven week 11 or week 18 is a cakewalk
*  I mean, it's a fucking cakewalk. They play nobody they have the easiest schedule in the league
*  Yep, so after that first three weeks we would recommend that's when you bet
*  Probably if they're one and two you'll get at least even odds right probably maybe 150 depending on what the other teams are
*  But you're right Fandl has 13 teams projected under eight wins. Atlanta plays eight of them
*  And so many bad quarterbacks name a bad quarterback. Atlanta's probably playing them. So I'm going under
*  Nine and a half wins is too rich for my blood
*  I don't think they can get to ten they feel like nine and eight eight nine and that's still gonna win the division
*  It might even be a case where
*  in week
*  17 week 18 they might have won the division already. Mm-hmm. They're locked into the four seed
*  It's like let's play Michael Penex for two games or you know, they're playing
*  I watch lose stupid games along the way, but yeah nine and eight is like I said plenty I think
*  Really good offensive line B. John Robinson who's gonna be the second running back taking any fantasy draft and then
*  We'll see with cousins
*  I am a little dubious of cousins and and I took Rogers as well as these older guys coming off and Achilles
*  I never loved cousins that much to begin with but cousins had before he got injured had 18 touchdown passes
*  It was the most in the league. Yeah, so you remember we were talking about how the Netflix show kind of gave him like a new
*  Mojo. Yeah, so we were going under with Atlanta and picking them to win the division
*  I think that's a first
*  Next one is Tampa Tampa over seven and a half wins juice on that minus 150 plus 290 for the division plus
*  152 to make the playoffs
*  Last year there are nine and eight
*  They beat Philadelphia and then they lost in round two to Detroit in a very very very close game
*  They lost Shaq Barrett and Devin weight. They lost their offensive coordinators down the Carolina coach their offensive lines a little better for the most part
*  it's a team that overachieved last year in a division that wasn't good and
*  Now the schedule
*  Which from week two to ten is among the toughest stretches of any team in there they play Washington week one
*  I couldn't get to eight wins with them. I have them under seven now
*  I think I have them at eight and oh no, I have them. Yeah, I do have a minute
*  So you have over here there's such a weird team aren't they you look at them?
*  Why should they have won nine games last year?
*  And why should they have beaten the Eagles and been a couple plays away from beating Detroit and they kind of have these same guys
*  You know, they tag Antoine Winfield. Yeah, we signed Levante Dave. It's all the same Mike. Yeah, well Goldstein Evans
*  They give Baker a hundred million dollars and it's like well, maybe he is a top
*  17 16 quarterback in the league to make the playoffs right there. I don't know what the defense will look like
*  They gave up 260 yards passing which was the most last year per team, but then they held the Eagles to nine points
*  So it's so strange, but you're right. They face all four
*  conference championship participants, so
*  It's brutal for the listeners. They're at Detroit home Philly at Atlanta
*  home Baltimore home Atlanta at KC
*  home San Francisco
*  That's all in the first ten weeks and then later they're at the Chargers and they're just a weird team at Dallas
*  So more primetime games. I don't know why but they do somehow their schedule is way harder than Atlanta's
*  Yeah, and it doesn't make a ton of sense to me
*  Also, they don't have a ton of talent like I'm under for them and I'm under for this next team, New Orleans
*  Over seven and a half wins pretty fair odds minus one. So you're over you're under everyone in division
*  Well, we'll get to go over Carol. So far. I have three unders in a row
*  Under six and a half wins all is plus 184 under five and a half wins all is plus 320
*  This is my favorite bad team
*  To go against I think they're gonna be an absolute train wreck they this
*  This combo of Dennis Allen who has the best worst coach fired odds or first coach fired odds. I think he's three to one
*  Derek Carr I was talking to somebody from New Orleans
*  Who lives there?
*  Do you realize how unpopular Derek Carr is with New Orleans fans like it like he's like public enemy number one
*  They can't stand him, right?
*  So their home games like they play their first game of the year is at Carol is home for Carolina, right?
*  It's like oh, we'll chalk that there want to know if they fall down three nothing and he throws a pick
*  They're gonna be booing the whole fucking game, right? Like they hate their car
*  So you have that and then you have Dennis Allen whose first coach fired odds are seven to one
*  So they brought back a coach QB combo that doesn't work
*  They lost Ram's act but they they spent their 14th pick on an old
*  Yeah on a tackle to try to replace him Dennis Allen career record 24 and 46. He's 22 and 49 versus the spread
*  I just I can't I just think they're gonna be awful
*  Yeah, but they were they were this last year and they were nine and eight, right?
*  And so right I have them over I get him right. I would not put a single dollar on this because you're right
*  I think the analysis starts and ends with
*  Dennis Allen Derek Carr combo and I don't even care what the other combinations are for a quarterback coach in a division
*  Did I calm Dennis Allen or Dennis Quinn keep it either way? I caught up Dennis Allen, right?
*  I thought about calling him Dennis Quinn. Who's Dennis Quinn?
*  People but there's buzz around this Clint Kubiak the 49ers passing coach
*  Yes gotten along well with car. So maybe things a little different cars. They have the 30s the schedule
*  They played one projected playoff team in the last six games and they start Carolina and at Atlanta
*  Dallas and Philly, I don't know. I just feel like if you're not Carolina you have a decent chance to get to eight wins
*  That's the other way to look at it. Well, they drafted Kool-Aid people like him. Yep, Kim Jordan's healthy
*  They added chase young. We'll see how many games he plays, right?
*  He's got he needs to kind of be great early chase you
*  I'm going we said goodbye to Michael Thomas. Maybe they'll be all right
*  I'm going hard under I'm intrigued by the under five and a half wins plus 320
*  Oh, and I think they're gonna suck and I also think this next team is gonna suck my fourth under in a row
*  That's right. I did the quadruple under you do that. Yeah, you're damn right. I can do it because if you add up
*  So Carolina five and a half
*  You were only seven apps or 13
*  Tampa is seven and a half. So now we're at twenty and a half and then Atlanta is nine and a half
*  So it's thirty and so it's 31 wins Vegas is saying the over under for this thing is 31 wins
*  I just read you all those stats. We've gone as low as 23 24 wins in a division
*  I just think we're going under with everybody. Let me ask him. Did you add up your wins and losses for I don't I think
*  Well, you're not a serious person. No, that's not psychotic
*  You can't have 20 more wins and losses no, but I think this division is gonna be the punching bag for everybody
*  That's where we're going so let's say Atlanta wins eight let's say let's I'll give I have them under two
*  I'll give you Atlanta nine and eight. I'll give you Tampa seven and ten. So now I'm at sixteen wins
*  I'm gonna give you New Orleans five wins about 21 and I'm gonna give you Carolina three wins 24 wins for the division
*  I'm calling it now Bill Stradamus
*  24 wins for the NFC South mark it down
*  You mark it down and look at the other conferences too
*  Exact exact wins for a division new bet Fando's never thought of that. You can do exact wins
*  Oh for a division. Oh, no, you could do it for each team. The NFC South will win 24 games
*  Wow, and so three years in a row under 10. Yeah, I'm with you. I don't well, here's the good news
*  New Orleans is gonna be awful. Here's the good news with the Panthers
*  They may get to keep their number one pick this year like they could have the worst record last year
*  They didn't get to pick it. They had to give it up
*  Well Panthers over under is five and a half. Yeah
*  Worst record is seven to one
*  Under three and a half wins alt is plus 340 if you want to get frisky last year there are two and 15 and
*  The only case for them winning more than two games is because the rest of the division is so bad, right?
*  They have new coach Dave Canales that nobody seems to believe they could they hired right?
*  Bounced around was offensive coordinator for Tampa and was like cool. Okay, they spent money on the O-line
*  Yeah, they drafted a receiver. They traded for Deontay Johnson. They drafted the get they added clowny which
*  Feels like a trade piece in week seven clowny for burns basically. Yeah, they lost burns. They lost Lubeau and you made the key point
*  they
*  The Bryce trade just depleted their picks
*  Yeah, they took all this draft capital and it just moved to Bryce Young a guy that we don't even know if it's he's a starting quarterback
*  Or not. This is a historically bad team. They've averaged five wins the last six seasons and they're paying three coaches
*  They're paying three and they saved the Bears the Bears were right
*  Nobody was more bummed out than Bears fans. They single-handedly rejuvenated an entire city and
*  They and for Bryce Young, I mean he was sacked and you said they spent a lot of money
*  65 sacks last year. Yeah and a 33 quarterback rating. I just don't I don't see it for them. They have zero prime time games
*  No one's expecting anything. Yeah, this Jonathan Brooks is already a little banged up there the running back from Texas
*  I wonder if that's the one game for week one though
*  Caroline at New Orleans and it's like car pick six
*  Shot of Dennis Allen
*  Announcers talking about well, you know their their car not exactly mr. Popularity around here
*  But his teammates like them hot seat
*  Yeah, hot seat car and then Dennis Allen split screen to the two of them on the sidelines Bryce young some fever
*  Carolinas want to know and then they don't win again. Yeah
*  I mean, that's the thing like how do you go over five and a half when they're not going to be favored in any game?
*  Are they fight for maybe home for Arizona? Maybe their favorite anyone who thinks they're gonna win six games is a lunatic
*  Okay, if you don't think they're gonna win six, yeah, that's like I got him under yeah
*  So I'm gonna say, you know, I think it wouldn't go six and eleven Carolina. No, it's like why don't go against us
*  What's our record when we agree?
*  Yeah, right
*  25 and 12 they traded
*  DJ Moore the ninth pick of last year's draft Jalen Carter the 61st pick of last year's draft Caleb Williams
*  Yeah, and a 20 25 second for Bryce. That is just a catastrophe
*  It's so bad. It's a tough French. It's right there. I know with the Vikings for unders. I also in my rankings. I
*  Only had them with two chip guys Brown or Brown horn. Mm-hmm. It's like a pink chipper. Yeah
*  So there you go the NFC South I'm going under across the board 24 wins South
*  So nobody has to win the division you have the Falcons winning though, maybe eight nine
*  They made Milton Berland and be like, I really need eight wins for this. It's so crazy
*  Yeah, but you're right wait on them because they might have a bad record after the first three. I have an interesting prop
*  Fandle is all over this stuff. I have to say and it's not just because they pay us in a flavored seltzer the cray
*  Chris Lindstrom first team all-pro guard plus 235. They have all-pro odds. Look at these
*  11
*  You're gonna love this all-pro first Christmas go get it Simmons. What what were the who are the receivers? I
*  Have to look now, but I mean
*  I think you're making this up. You just make that up this now. No, it's there
*  Few and you're making this up. What it was yesterday. What state are you in?
*  You know
*  We'd stay to California. No. No, what state are you looking at? What is it?
*  I always do Massachusetts so I can see my bets that I asked to choose it. Yeah. Wait a minute. Um, I'm not an idiot
*  I believe it. I swear I believe you we don't argue about it. Yeah, my favorite prop is
*  God so many for this division
*  Now I'm mad I can't find this
*  Oh
*  Man, I my favorite prop is the one I'm gonna make fan to create the over under
*  Of wins for this division and I'm gonna make them boost it and we'll go under well just bet all four under yeah
*  Yeah, but let's do maybe the over under is even higher than I thought
*  Maybe it's like 20 maybe maybe they'll make it 31 and a half for the division. No, well, so it's doing all under
*  Let's add so it's five and a half at seven. I did that already it added up to 31. Okay, sorry 20
*  Yeah, I don't think it did did it said it
*  Seven half five and a half
*  Yeah, oh people get there is to math to like it to middle-aged guys do math. I'm not a math. Yes podcast
*  I'm not narrative. I'm not math, but I know the Cowboys
*  All right, the NFC West we did the least wins last five years by division. Mm-hmm. You're the most
*  Last year AFC North 43 year before NFC East 43
*  NFC West 40 AFC North 38 NFC West 38 so last two years 43
*  This is my number one division. I like all the teams in it. Yeah, I think there's gonna be wins coming out of it and
*  You like to take your team out of it if you can only watch games from any division
*  Well, we have an attachment to this division because we they just fuck us over and over again with the schedule
*  It's just a fuck job attachment. Yeah, we've eleven early games and two late games
*  So it's like all right Arizona in the ramps. I guess I'm gonna study every play of this
*  But uh, but I do feel like we watch a lot of this and I enjoy every team in this division
*  Don't you I do I think I'd go AFC North though
*  If I had to not watch the Cowboys and just watch every yeah, but the AFC North has Deshawn and I don't want to watch Cleveland
*  I just don't want to watch Cleveland's offense. Okay, and I'm and I'm not sure I want to watch Pittsburgh's offense either
*  No defense. So I'm gonna start with San Francisco
*  They're over is 11 and a half
*  Plus 126 they're begging you to try to go 12 wins for them
*  Minus 158 if you want to go under they are minus 190 for the division. They are
*  One seed plus 490 best record 9 to 1
*  If you want to get super crazy and go all under eight and a half say they're gonna have a losing record for the year
*  That's plus 360 if you want to go the other way and say they're going 13 games or more. That's plus 235
*  Last year there at 12 and 5 they won two playoff games and then lost in the Super Bowl in overtime and the Super Bowl
*  Hangover is real south. I believe it
*  I'm under me, too
*  And it's really Super Bowl hangover I you called out McCaffrey hurt already Trent Williams hold out and that's and
*  Debo who really hasn't been like a super duper impact guy in two years and
*  pretty
*  Purty with some weird preseason stuff already and some picks and some and I don't need too many guys to be good
*  To be to get to where they are. I know that wasn't eloquent. No, I know they lose chase young they lose Eric Armstead
*  They lose Eric Kendrick's Jack Ken law Joseph day, but I think that calf injury is a real thing from McCaffrey
*  I'm staying away from them in any fantasy league. I'm not just saying that so that people on their bid
*  I'd you know can't have some hamstrings are terrifying
*  Yeah
*  No good and because it seems like they're coming back and they just don't for another month
*  I'm trying Williams just seems to always hold out. Right? This is a this is an issue for them
*  They have one of the worst rest schedules. I think in the light is number one. Yep
*  Yeah, I read that and who fog is coming back but not might not be
*  100% probably till like week five week six Green Law's coming back. They face all three teams
*  They met in the postseason. I think 12 is a lot, you know, you got
*  Two division losses you got Casey Dallas Rams Buffalo Chicago, Miami Detroit and not a bad team
*  Yeah, but 1112 is too many
*  The reasons to get excited I guess are they beeped up their pass rush a little bit
*  But that's really it it's the same team as last year with with a lot of salary cap decisions and probably the last year
*  With the purdy rookie contract and being able to have that advantage
*  You know, it's interesting if they lose that Jets game on Monday night in week one, which that lines dropped now
*  It's plus four and I was mad. I didn't bet it at plus four and a half, but I
*  Think the Jets can go in there and win especially with all this weird stuff with the Niners
*  Yeah at Minnesota week two and then at the Rams week three like there is like they could start out one and two and people
*  Wondering what's going on, but then they get the Pats home Arizona home
*  Yeah
*  There's a little bit of relief in there a little bit little bit later at Seattle home
*  NKC home Dallas week six seven eight and then
*  And then it gets hard again in the week week 11 week 12. Yeah, two Thursday two Sunday two Monday night games
*  You didn't mention this Brandon Stanley is the assistant head coach now
*  That make you laugh do I make you laugh
*  He's back he is back I did forget to mention that
*  Yeah, they they're another one that gets super weird at the end of the year where they have like the Sunday night game the Thursday
*  Monday night game like you know and they also had that big bulls that week after week combined with the Super Bowl hangover I
*  Hate their road games
*  You just go on down the line. They're just playing some really good offenses on the road, right?
*  They're at Miami. They're at Arizona. They're at Buffalo
*  They're a Green Bay even at Tampa at Seattle's maybe throw at the Rams Minnesota is the only bad road offense
*  They're gonna have their defense also is weird
*  They were like third in the league and points against with 17, but they were terrible on third down
*  We never we always talked about that last year
*  We always thought their defense was suspect the church should have beaten them
*  Right and then Casey was able to move the ball on them whenever they wanted I had them in my player rankings
*  They were second. They were 38 points and
*  They have good players all over the place and a great coaching pass rush
*  But but we're this year the McCaffrey thing is terrifying. Mm-hmm. Yeah
*  and I don't know where he goes in fantasy drafts and I don't know how he affects that over but
*  It has to be worth two wins. So alright, we're both under on them
*  But I still think they're probably 10 or 11 wins. Yeah, we don't think they're worse than 10
*  I don't think they could be terrible just just just by the name recognition if these guys stay healthy
*  LA Rams
*  over eight and a half
*  Juice on that minus 152. I think people just like betting overs
*  Division plus 330 a little tasty if you're really excited about San Francisco not being that great playoffs minus 105
*  Go 11 plus wins plus 225 there were 10 and 7 last year and barely lost to Detroit in a game
*  They easily could have won 24 to 23
*  they
*  They signed a much better batch of defensive backs
*  They spent money on their offensive line
*  But their left tackles out for at least week one. Yeah, Jackson
*  They lost Raheem Morris as defensive coordinator and then
*  What was the name of that guy they had he was the best defensive frontline guy of all time. What was his name Aaron?
*  Aaron Rodgers now is Aaron
*  Aaron Carter and Aaron Donald they lost that guy. Yeah, he's not on the team
*  No, and they're like now we're replacing we have some young guys, but it's like
*  So that was my hesitation with them and their schedule is really hard and they play a bunch of awesome offenses
*  But I still have it over so I have to get to ten wins coaching quarterback skill players receivers
*  It is tough to bet against McVeigh. It really is
*  I thought they were gonna be one of the worst teams last year and they always seem to have a rookie jump out now
*  Pookin the coup is a little banged up. Yeah Stafford to Stafford. That was my case last year
*  I was like this guy's got like spine surgery and everything
*  But if he makes it, you know, you got your boy Jimmy G as the backup
*  But you mentioned Jonah Jackson's out but he gets the most out of his players McVeigh and I do have them to win the division
*  And what'd you say plus 330?
*  Yes, so do you wait a week on that because they're at Detroit week one
*  So maybe you wait a week and then grab it
*  Yeah, I could wait but then the Niners are the jet right the Niners lose that might move anyway
*  Yeah, yeah Michael Floors a new OC Chris Schull is a new defensive coordinator
*  Just I'm a McVeigh guy now. It was really really me too last year was so inspiring and it was it was just
*  give him like six or seven good players and
*  Somewhat of a pass rush and just be able to block a little bit
*  Yeah, it's fun
*  And one of these rookies like I said always seems to step up Jared verse the Florida State the defensive end
*  I think that's my defensive rookie of the year pick. Oh, I like it. Yeah, so I'm definitely over for them
*  I'm intrigued by the
*  11 plus wins
*  Plus 225 but the juice isn't great enough, but I love the playoffs bet the playoffs
*  Minus 105 bet yeah, and I was trying to knock out
*  Three playoff teams because you know I tried to knock out the three in the AFC the three in the NFC
*  So in the AFC I knocked out Cleveland Buffalo in Miami. Those are my three and
*  then
*  in the in the NFC I
*  Knocked out Tampa and I knocked out Dallas
*  Hmm and I was gonna knock out the Rams as my third one because I didn't want to knock out
*  Detroit San Francisco Philly Atlanta Green Bay
*  I was like I got somebody's got a guy guess it has to and then I was like, you know what fuck it
*  So I only I only knocked out two. Yes. That's what I did. Yeah
*  I don't feel good about it because I know there's gonna be three but I'm not gonna overreact and just it's fine
*  You went under and all four NFC South nothing matters really that was great
*  That's gonna be remembered as one of the great Nick Wright is gonna be in awe of that. I can't wait
*  I can't wait for Nick Wright's feedback. I
*  I
*  Really like this next team
*  The Seattle Seahawks, man, I couldn't get there over seven and a half. Mm-hmm
*  They're plus 172 to make the playoffs
*  They're plus 210 for 10 plus wins
*  701 for the division and I had this as a healthy over hmm
*  I think at least nine and I'm not opposed to the 10 the plus 210
*  I really like this team easy schedule first couple weeks
*  They go Denver at the Pats home Miami and that could be a 3-0 coming out of the gates new coach theory
*  Kicking in full throttle with Mike McDonald to I thought did an awesome job with Baltimore last year
*  I you know, we're just watching on the couch
*  I never tried to go completely overboard with the coordinators unless it's like a Lou Amarillo that Cincinnati year
*  But like the stuff they were doing a Baltimore with all the injuries they had was nuts
*  Yeah, so he's going from Pete Carroll to him
*  They also have the three receivers. I think have to be in the running for best three receiver combo
*  Mm-hmm, and then they lucked out with that 16th pick they got Murphy
*  To just put you in the front of the line because everybody was taking offense and this guy just falls from
*  Basically eight spots this guy you can put right in it was exactly what they needed
*  Plus you think last year where they had JSN and they'd witherspoon two first-round picks are now in year two
*  Yeah, I just think they have a lot of talent. I like the team
*  I couldn't figure out how they got worse. I have the better and the worst and I was like
*  How did this team get worse? Just seems like they're plus healthy Kenneth Walker
*  A lot of people are in on like he might be awesome this year. I don't love I don't have a strong feeling on this
*  I did go under
*  Really? I have a hot take here. I think Pete Carroll was a very good coach. I watched Russell Wilson
*  Won all those years with him towards the end
*  Even last year a little fraudulent
*  They were nine and eight but got the most that like they had a minus 38 point differential at nine and eight
*  so like just kind of like
*  Figured out like this Mike McDonald might be good, but I don't know there were 31st and third down defense
*  I got a ways to go there five of the last I think but that was the problem with Pete Carroll last year
*  I think the defense he just couldn't crack the defense anymore. They used to be like especially
*  Oh, we not looking at backup quarterbacks enough
*  Like there were 66 quarterbacks last year and now you got Sam Howell and Gino's already got a little bit of a hip injury
*  Same how through for almost 4,000 yards last year what college?
*  Pro's you know that I know that is nuts. That's my favorite stat last year
*  I just think they take a little step back, but okay not crazy about it over for them and
*  then I have a
*  Arizona is
*  Our last team in the conference or division and I'm over for them to real it
*  Yeah, I did the four runners in the NFC South from the four overs and or three of four overs in the
*  NFC West over seven and a half plus 124 there's juice on that
*  Worst record there 16 and one there for 13 last year and had a nice feel good end of the year stretch
*  Offense is gonna be super duper duper fun
*  Kyler Murray healthy full season for him
*  Marvin Harrison
*  The I would say the most anticipated rookie receiver in 20 years from where he's being drafted in fantasy leagues
*  That's that yeah in the ESPN drafts is the highest rookie ever drafted I
*  Think high fits brought up a good point is it gonna be better than Pukka Nakua is it gonna break the record sounds great
*  Maybe he'll be even better than that and that would have to break records
*  They beefed up their D line including with the first round of Darius Robinson
*  They beat up their O line year two of Jonathan Gannon
*  You know what I was thinking well you go on Arizona. Why are you against them? I just think it's way high
*  I don't know think they're going from four to eight and I look just look at this schedule like I think they could lose
*  Five out of the first six they start at Buffalo Rams Detroit Washington at San Francisco at Green Bay
*  So you're confident and then I'm going I mean what are they gonna get out of that two and four?
*  That feels like two and four and then they have to get
*  Six and I can't do six and four the rest of the way six and six
*  I don't know I don't think they're getting there right there was such a weird team
*  They were four and thirteen, but they beat the Cowboys figure and figure those split the Rams games because they always do all right
*  They'll win in Carolina beat the Pats. That's three
*  They'll win one of those home games against Chicago and the Jets I
*  Just think that they're probably by the way the other thing with the NFC this year
*  We should have mentioned this earlier is the NFC has the extra home game right so they have the nine home games
*  Yeah, can they go five and four at home, and then yeah, maybe steel
*  They just have to steal three road games one of the weird things is like people pretend
*  This the Sean didn't play last year. I told you it was five and one Murray was three and five last year
*  He played half the season you know so I don't know maybe they're better
*  They did get better at certain positions, but they have back-to-back road games three times this year
*  I don't feel super strongly about it, but I feel like they can get to eight and then all right
*  I liked what I saw down the stretch last year, and I do think they have
*  They have I really like their offense and we didn't mention James Connor
*  I think their offense is gonna be hard to play they'll be fun usually those teams, but if you think like
*  How many bad teams are in the NFC?
*  Right the entire NFC South
*  Minnesota possibly Chicago if things don't work very well
*  Washington and the Giants
*  Maybe Washington definitely the Giants. That's half of the conference. Oh, yeah, right
*  So is the Arizona and no quarterbacks have gotten hurt yet, so yeah, you're right. I just don't like that stretch that first stretch
*  So what's your favorite prop? I'm going Fred Warner over one and a half interceptions
*  Interceptions are lucky, but he had four last year plus 126 gets his big mitts up there seems to corral on every three
*  I mean what page of Fando was that on like page 7 million look deep man. You got dig Fred Warner
*  Realize we're going that deep Jesus. I mean Rams to win the division. I think is maybe my
*  weirdest of all plus 330
*  yeah, I will say and I don't even know if I'm gonna bet it but I
*  Would say the
*  Rams division odds are probably the juiciest odds, but my favorite is the like the juiciest division odds of any division
*  We've done yeah, we're just like them being plus 330 just seems too high, but I think playoffs minus 105 is my favorite Rams
*  Rams for the place is not enough teams so I
*  Have for the for the playoffs in the NFC Detroit San Francisco
*  Philadelphia Atlanta is the four seed just put Atlanta in the four seed now
*  Yeah, just put them in concrete and then I have Green Bay
*  The Rams in Seattle as my three wild card games, and I have your team out have Washington Green Bay
*  See 49ers as the wild cards, okay, so you have Washington in the Seattle spot basically yeah, okay?
