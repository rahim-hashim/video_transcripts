# NFL Season’s Biggest Surprises With Peter Schrager  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [November 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EotlwLLOtY)
*  We are heading into week 12. There's a bunch of bye weeks. Thanksgiving's coming up. We're hitting that second stage of the NFL season.
*  We know who's good. We know who's not good. We know there's gonna be one surprise team coming. We have a sense of who the seven contenders are.
*  Biggest surprise for you after 11 weeks. You can say anything.
*  Thing you're most shocked by.
*  The Jets.
*  Right, you know the Jets. See, I feel like I picked the Jets to win the AFC East, but I also like was fully aware of this alternate universe where everything went wrong and that's what's happening.
*  All right. So that the just the fact that like I haven't bought into the hype over here. I live in New York. I grew up with all Jets fans like and I've never been one to say, well, this is the year, you know, they drafted Denzel Mims. This is the year, you know, they got Elijah Moore. This is going to be the year.
*  And then I fell for it. I've said you felt for it hard.
*  There's MVP Rogers videos of you on the Internet's.
*  Shameful. And that whoever runs that freezing takes or that old takes exposed like he has no he has no problem posting that every single time the Jets lose a game of me saying that Rogers is going to be MVP.
*  And we all have those.
*  We've got them out there. It's fine.
*  I will say this.
*  I felt so hard this year for the Jets because I looked at the AFC and I'm like, there's an opening here.
*  I didn't think Buffalo was going to be what they were.
*  I had a feeling Miami would take it down.
*  And I thought, you know, obviously New England.
*  I was like, this is the year there's a window.
*  The the seas are parting and the talent and the clip of us talking week one has gone viral again, has been reposted.
*  And I still don't regret what I said.
*  You go top to bottom on that roster.
*  The names are outstanding.
*  And I guess I got caught up in it and it's not fantasy football.
*  And there is something called chemistry.
*  And when you fire your coach five weeks into the season, that's not always going to be the greatest decision.
*  And at the end of the day, I felt for it hard and I hand up.
*  I fucked up. I was wrong.
*  Jets suck. And it's it's it's a shame because they're going to start they're going to try to rebuild this thing.
*  By the way, everything you just said, we we could probably just insert sixers like as a voiceover for every piece of that.
*  I fell for it. I didn't chemistry.
*  I didn't realize it was going to go sideways.
*  But we knew this was the risk with the Jets.
*  Rogers is old. Rogers coming off major surgery.
*  The Sun Reddick thing was weird.
*  Salah had never had a winning season.
*  They were trying to shoehorn this Rogers thing into the Jets.
*  They're the Jets. Bad things happen with the Jets.
*  I fell for it, too. I picked them over Buffalo.
*  And what we both of us missed is what Sal nailed before the season.
*  Yeah. What if this is the Josh Allen year and now it looks like it's the Josh Allen year?
*  He's your MVP through 12 weeks.
*  Josh Allen's your MVP.
*  And, you know, fantasy is so funny on these Sundays.
*  I know it's like he's he's looking it's shot and fraud almost like his tweet is so pressing it now that he did on the day, the Monday of week one.
*  Where he's basically like, just having it on record right now,
*  I think this Aaron Rodgers thing is going to be a massive failure and everyone's going to get fired at the end of the year.
*  The only wrong thing about it was it wasn't the end of the year.
*  It was before even Thanksgiving.
*  And he was right. So I was wrong on the Jets.
*  And, you know, I'll take my beating.
*  The thing that's been a pleasant surprise and I didn't see it coming was what we got in Pittsburgh.
*  And I think it's a really cool story.
*  And of course, they're playing as we record this, they're playing tonight.
*  And there's always weird things that happen on short weeks on Thursday nights.
*  And maybe they lose. Yeah.
*  Goofy weather, the whole thing overall, though, like if you told me that Russell Wilson was going to take a visit with the Giants,
*  was going to fly commercial to Pittsburgh, was going to sell his wares as a potential future hall of famer to these teams and say, who wants me?
*  And at the Denver Broncos, we're going to pay 95 percent of his contract this season, no matter who we went to because of what was already owed.
*  And he would be the one leading the Pittsburgh Steelers into Thanksgiving as the one or two seed in the AFC.
*  I would have told you you're crazy. So you could have told me I was crazy because I predicted all of those things before the season.
*  It's one of my best ones. Where's freezing cold takes on that?
*  Come on, maybe they should have smoking hot takes should be an alternate account of people just crushing preseason picks.
*  Where's that account? I met the guy who bronze, right?
*  And he's supposed to be negative.
*  Where's the positive positive stuff about the media?
*  Come on, the broads out, the broads out on social media.
*  That's every year.
*  That's like when my wife gets mad at one of her friends or something.
*  They're talking to her again. And then six weeks later, they're hanging out.
*  Twenty eight years on social media.
*  Now LeBron is out.
*  Yeah, it's too toxic.
*  The guy's name was Fred Siegel.
*  That's who does the freezing cold takes.
*  And I got that. He like reached out to me, came on Good Morning Football, did a book about I love this guy.
*  Now he's trying to murder my career.
*  It is everything that comes out.
*  Well, I think he's an equal opportunity murderer.
*  It's where he's where he's fashioned himself.
*  I got to say the most shocking thing for me is Buffalo.
*  It's I'm not shocked that they're, you know, going to get to 10 wins, because that was
*  if you were picking the Jets over them, I thought there's only going to be one AFC East playoff team.
*  And I just thought the Jets had more stacked their way than Buffalo in this goofy year they're having.
*  So Buffalo winning the AFC East and the Jets thinking not that surprising to me.
*  But Buffalo being good is surprising.
*  Yeah, I don't really fully understand it.
*  I don't know enough about like the mechanics of how you get a defense going that seems pretty flimsy.
*  And yet when you watch them like hats on the ball, sideline locked in really well coached,
*  really seems like they're across the board locked in, don't really have any weaknesses, which is crazy,
*  because they've had a lot of attrition, they've had injuries.
*  And I just don't fully understand it.
*  Like weird rookie receivers and young receivers or never did it before receivers,
*  a hodgepodge running game with a bunch of running backs.
*  I just don't fully get it.
*  They're so good.
*  And what they've done is they've like they've they've found ways to win games that they used to lose.
*  So that Chiefs game, of course, they've beaten the Chiefs three different times the regular season.
*  But like there was that window where it's like, OK, here comes Kansas City.
*  And after the third and one that they go to, they handed it to Ty Johnson for a one yard loss.
*  Yeah, bad play.
*  You're like, all right, fourth and two.
*  I remember last year in the playoffs, they trotted out the punt team
*  and they ran a fake punt with Demar Hamlin on fourth down.
*  And that one was justifiable in that they couldn't stop Kansas City.
*  Kansas City was going up and down the field.
*  I think Mahomes scored in five of six possessions like, all right, we did fine.
*  McDermott took a beating.
*  He became a punching bag.
*  Everyone made their jokes.
*  They had the courage to say, you know what?
*  Screw it. We're going for it again.
*  And if we fail and come up short and we lose, like we'll deal with it.
*  Wait a second.
*  Do you think that was courage, though?
*  Because sometimes I'm like, why are they doing this?
*  But usually I'm saying, why are they doing this when your quarterback's like James Winston?
*  Right. Or you're or you have like a rookie quarterback.
*  You're like, why are they doing this? They're not good.
*  They're up to they're up to.
*  I like I like it. I thought Romo Romo sniffed it out.
*  He's like, give the ball to Josh. Let him decide the game.
*  I was like, I actually agree.
*  Let him decide the game.
*  And of course, it works out.
*  And Josh is Superman.
*  And that's an amazing one of the all time.
*  Like that rivalry, that's a play that goes on the list.
*  If they kick the field goal and they've gone up five,
*  it reminds me a little bit of the floor against the Buccaneers and then
*  AFC championship and the championship game a few years back.
*  It's like we've got to stop them once and get the ball back.
*  They didn't want to do that.
*  And that that's with scar tissue from the year before
*  of not wanting to do that and getting burned on it with that fake punt.
*  So McDermid. But you know what?
*  That was it was a risky non risk because they had like a five game lead in the AFC East.
*  It's like like you lose that game.
*  It's like, all right.
*  So maybe we're going to be a three seed instead of a two seed.
*  Like, but it really wasn't was it a massive risk?
*  Like if the Ravens did something like that this week when they're seven and four,
*  you know, and it's a must win game against the Chargers, a little more,
*  a little higher stakes on that one than I think Buffalo.
*  Yeah, I also think it was a gift for for us in our world as a media,
*  because Kansas City wins that.
*  Then they have a three game lead over Buffalo plus the tiebreaker.
*  And it's like, all right, we've already got our playoff pictures wide open now.
*  Yeah. And and Buffalo is not going to suck.
*  Christmas Day games is like an AFC semifinals.
*  You've got the Texans and the Ravens and you've got the Steelers and the Chiefs.
*  So I think it was a huge game.
*  It was a huge win. And as much as Josh Allen downplayed it.
*  And I know a lot of people on Monday morning, our guy, Kyle Brant, was like,
*  as a Bill's guy, he's like, that was nothing like stop.
*  Like, don't make a big deal out of this.
*  It was a week 11 game in 100 years.
*  We'll forget about it. I felt the opposite.
*  And traditionally, I'm the chiefs guy.
*  I pick the chiefs to win every year.
*  And I've I've made a lot of bones in the playoffs.
*  And they're going on the road to Baltimore.
*  They're going to win. They're going on the road to Buffalo.
*  Less than they're going to win.
*  I thought that one.
*  I felt like Buffalo was the better team.
*  They were they were more dynamic.
*  They felt like they had more deep threats.
*  And, gosh, I thought they were better coach, too.
*  So I thought that was a big thing for Buffalo.
*  You agree with my theory.
*  That they kept Kelsey in the garage for that game.
*  The Ferrari, I heard you talking about that with Sal.
*  It felt like, let's let's not show all our cards in this game game by then.
*  The thing I was most concerned about the chiefs
*  and especially like listening to some pods and reading stuff
*  over the next couple of days after the game.
*  Their tackles might not be good.
*  Right. And they figured out a way to to kind of, you know, scotch tape shit together.
*  We've seen them do this a million times.
*  But it seems like both tackles aren't really any good now.
*  And I don't know if they can get something going from there.
*  But from an offensive line standpoint, this feels like the shakiest they've been.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  And look, the last time their tackles gave us those questions
*  was going to the Super Bowl against the Buccaneers.
*  And they didn't have they didn't have Fisher.
*  They didn't have Schwartz. And we're like, all right.
*  But they'll figure it out.
*  And then the Buccaneers, you know, obviously, it manhandled them
*  at the line of scrimmage and then we lost.
*  Where's freezing cold takes for that guy?
*  Multiple videos of us guaranteeing a buck Super Bowl win.
*  I don't see him digging those up.
*  Jesus.
*  Freddie Siegel.
*  Anyway, the the the other part of it is like, you know, they throw that
*  they try to get worthy involved early.
*  And I was like, it's a little bit of this being chippy, like, you know,
*  the bills traded us this guy, we're going to get we're going to get worthy involved.
*  And then worthy steps out of bounds when he has the whole field one foot.
*  And you're like, that's not chiefs football.
*  Like, that doesn't go that way.
*  So, by the way, that was Patriots football is what it was.
*  I've watched that all year.
*  Wide open guys stepping out of bounds.
*  Terrible blocking. Stupid strategies.
*  That's Pats football right now.
*  I get worried about the chiefs with that because their defense has led the way for them.
*  Their special teams has been awesome.
*  Now, but goes down and now the Spencer Schrader is going to have to make
*  a couple of big kicks. We'll see.
*  But like, who's scaring you besides my homes?
*  And you could say it's because, hey, when you need them,
*  Kelsey's going to go 10 for 120 with two touchdowns.
*  Maybe he hasn't been that guy.
*  I know a couple of big statistical games the last few weeks, but like,
*  I don't think Kelsey's doing like he was doing it a couple of years ago.
*  And then, you know, you're throwing the ball to Noah Gray and Justin Watson
*  and Juju like an Xavier Worthy is a nice deep threat.
*  But I just don't know if this chiefs team has enough firepower.
*  And it sounds crazy to say that with an Andy Reid offense that has Patrick
*  Mahomes at quarterback.
*  We said it last year in December was one of the I mean,
*  I think their bottom three explosive plays this year,
*  which is crazy for our Mahomes team.
*  Like if you have Mahomes in fantasy, hasn't gone great.
*  But we watched them reinvent themselves after that Christmas game,
*  Christmas Eve game when I was in the right after they immediately reinvent themselves.
*  They're also they're built when the weather gets colder.
*  That's going to be good for them, too.
*  I don't think it's going to be as good for some of the other teams.
*  So I'm not I'm not panicking.
*  And by the way, they almost won the game.
*  And I do think of Worthy hadn't stepped out of bounds.
*  They probably win the game.
*  But on the other hand, you're relying on worthy in these big spots.
*  It's going to be the same situation in January.
*  But who did you who do you have Super Bowl?
*  You had Lions winning it all.
*  I had I ended up with Lions over Texans.
*  OK, and then right before the season,
*  I felt like the chiefs had become undervalued and I did a Lions
*  chief Lions chief Super Bowl bet that was like 30.
*  All the Lions stuff is going to hit one seed and if you know, like
*  I think that's been the least surprising thing is the Lions kind of they were
*  were who they thought they was the opposite of Danny Green.
*  The Lions were who we thought they were.
*  We thought they were.
*  I did chiefs over Packers and my Packers can be done with that.
*  And I'm not done with that.
*  And my packers caveat was they're going to do it as a wild card
*  because the Lions are going to be the one seed and going to run away with this.
*  So that's all still in play.
*  Detroit. But one thing on the Packers, we're going to know this weekend.
*  I think we're going to have a real feeling because they have a nice game
*  against the Niners that they should win.
*  We talk about a million dollar picks later.
*  That's if if something good is going to happen to them in January,
*  I need them to win the Niners game.
*  And if they don't, I'm going to be
*  probably probably tapping out. Yeah.
*  Yeah. The Lions have been an interesting one because it's been like this locomotive
*  and they really will be one of the only teams in the league in 2024
*  where everyone's buddy and exchanging jerseys like they'll snap your neck.
*  They don't care. Like they. Yeah.
*  I saw a stat.
*  They scored more than 50 points three times from the year 1920 to the year 2023.
*  They've already scored more than 50 points twice this year,
*  and they have embarrassed teams and they've also won close games,
*  which is obviously the Vikings game with Jake Bates in those fields.
*  And then the comeback game with against the Texans.
*  So they've won in a variety of different ways.
*  Yeah. The where they overcame golf's, you know, five interceptions
*  and still had to found a way.
*  So like I kind of like it that it's not just been oh seven Patriots or 2013
*  Broncos where they just rip every team apart.
*  Like they've been in games too, and they've won those as well.
*  And some adversity.
*  It's not like everything went great this year.
*  They lost Hutchinson.
*  He was the best defensive front four guy in the league.
*  They lost their defensive captain two weeks ago.
*  Though I like the David Logs signing.
*  I thought that was I was surprised he got waived.
*  I liked him a couple of years ago.
*  James Williams got suspended.
*  Goff had the five pick game.
*  You know, it hasn't been perfect, but they're doing the they're almost
*  like a college football team, some games.
*  Yeah, they're not just beating teams.
*  They're like absolutely select.
*  When you score seven straight touchdowns to start a game, that's like a
*  you're on a different level at that point.
*  Seven straight possessions.
*  It's wild. It's great Super Bowl ads.
*  They're the it's the first time ever in their history.
*  And I don't know how far back these gambling sites go, but I saw it
*  as the first time ever that they are the Super Bowl favorite ever.
*  It has to be.
*  When I mean, it is a very Sanders.
*  I don't I don't think they're the favorites.
*  Yeah, they're 350 right now.
*  The Chiefs are five to one.
*  The Bills are plus 650.
*  And then the Eagles are sitting there at eight to one.
*  Houston's at 17 to one.
*  It's it it does feel a little hodgepodge.
*  Like you look at some of the Super Bowl matchups because they have all the
*  different matchups and it's like, you know, let's say let's say
*  I still feel like the Chiefs to win the Super Bowl until they have actually
*  lost the Super Bowl is still in my head.
*  I'm always going to be afraid of that one for a Lions thing.
*  But the Chiefs to beat the Lions is 14 to one.
*  But you look at some of these other dopey ones like
*  Chiefs to beat Arizona is 85 to one.
*  It's not insane that Arizona could make the super.
*  I'm not really not ruling out anyone is my point.
*  As good as Detroit's look, I'm not really at anyone.
*  I'm just not. Well, it's just that with Detroit, it's like, all right.
*  Let's say they have home field advantage.
*  They want to play off games there last year.
*  They beat the Rams and they beat the Bucks.
*  They did fine. And then they went on the road and lost.
*  And it's like how it usually works is you don't with the rare exception of maybe
*  the Eagles a couple of years ago with Foles or like the 99 Rams,
*  where you just come out of literally nowhere and you're like, we're
*  we're just going to win a Super Bowl.
*  We're going to.
*  Usually you have to go through the progression of.
*  You go and you go to the playoffs and you lose a tough one
*  and then you win the other round.
*  Yeah, did it.
*  So like it's all there for them.
*  I just have thoughts of Dan Campbell,
*  high management, game management, close game late, going up against.
*  I'm a guy going up against
*  maybe a Kyle Shanahan, who everyone has their own issues with at the end of games,
*  but like has been there also time and time again.
*  It's that kind of stuff that it's an intangible and you can't do it until you do it.
*  But just as so many teams have gotten to the precipice
*  and had to lose a couple of times before they got to that over the hump,
*  maybe this is Detroit needing one more year.
*  We'll see.
*  That was my case when I picked them, that there is like actual history.
*  And I think there were four different instances of the team that got really close
*  the year before, learned, you know, learned something and then was able to apply it
*  and either win the Super Bowl or come really close.
*  And I think it happened like five times.
*  And the ravens lost to you guys.
*  Lee Evans dropped the pass and then Billy Cundiff.
*  Yeah.
*  And then the very next year, they're like, screw it.
*  They go into Foxborough.
*  They beat you guys.
*  And then they go in and win the Super Bowl.
*  Like, that's a recent memory of a team that had to lose and then found a way to win.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, now we hit the portion of the podcast where I make my guests talk about Drake
*  May for 60 seconds.
*  This is unbelievable.
*  This whole week watching football, Twitter, people like Orlovsky
*  weighed in a couple of times, all the football experts like who's the guy Colin has?
*  Kosel. He came in film.
*  All the all the film guys are coming in like you guys don't realize
*  what Drake May is doing right now.
*  You don't understand what's happening here.
*  I've been going nuts.
*  I can't. I did this the most I've texted about the past since like the Flake 8.
*  This is the most excited I've been.
*  F minus coaching staff.
*  No receivers.
*  Can't really block running backs.
*  They can't do anything.
*  So I just this is where I make my guests talk about Drake May.
*  So talk about Drake May.
*  He's been unbelievable.
*  And I talked to McVeigh Monday morning.
*  McVeigh was another one.
*  Gosh.
*  They called him a stud in that press conference.
*  And I hit up Sean just to talk about, you know, their game, whatever.
*  And then I also said, like, let's talk about it.
*  And he was just like that guy.
*  I mean, they got their guy.
*  That guy's unbelievable.
*  Like what a what a performance.
*  And the stat I got from my researcher at Good Morning Football, a great guy named Dante says
*  this was the second time in May's career that he threw the ball 40 times or more,
*  completed 70 percent of his passes.
*  And only two other rookies in the history of the sport have done that.
*  And it's Justin Herbert and it's Joe Burrow.
*  And like Drake May's already done it twice.
*  Like we're talking and he does 95 percent of the offense, which you've noted.
*  Like it's just a third on my shoulders.
*  I'll figure it out.
*  And they're not even running the right place for him.
*  Like half the time, you're like, what was that?
*  Why did we do that?
*  What are we doing?
*  He's he's doing it with with talent that might not be starting on other NFL
*  rosters, which is now, I think, a kind thing to say.
*  The offensive line lives a lot to be desired.
*  The coaching isn't exactly the offensive line like Cole Strange is coming back.
*  And when that Cole Strange is coming back, like,
*  he's back, baby.
*  We have another guard.
*  It's covered.
*  It's been really cool to see, in fact, this whole rookie class
*  and not to get off the Drake May conversation.
*  No, we're good. You gave me a minute.
*  We can all had they've all had their moments.
*  And like as great as Drake May was in the early window on Sunday.
*  I know everyone was watching those those chiefs like
*  Bo Nicks was fucking amazing.
*  He's gotten better every week for like six weeks.
*  And Moose Johnston was doing the game and he dropped his little nugget.
*  And I'm like, oh, I don't I didn't know that.
*  Like Moose is like, we spoke to Sean Payton in the production meeting,
*  which we always talk about the value of the production meeting,
*  whether you're there or you're not.
*  You believe it or not.
*  And he's like, and he said he liked Nicks more than all these rookie
*  quarterbacks in the draft.
*  They're like, that's crazy. He was the sixth one taken.
*  Like, wow. I believe it.
*  It's the perfect match.
*  There was no crazy ramp up period for him.
*  He's 26 years old.
*  He's played in 61 college games.
*  He's seen it all.
*  He's played at big programs, Auburn and Oregon.
*  He's had failure. He's had success.
*  He's done the senior ball.
*  Sean Payton does not want to work with a raw product, an unpolished guy
*  that he's got to like frustrated himself with.
*  He wants him to run his offense as like an avatar of himself.
*  Like, here's what you're going to do and do it.
*  Drake May's been doing it.
*  There was a pass he had to Cortland Sutton where it was a play action pass,
*  rolled right, pumped it twice and then like dropped it in the bucket to Sutton
*  over AJ Terrell.
*  And I'm like, that's a 10 year vet play that he just did.
*  And he's doing it.
*  So I say all this because May's having moments.
*  Nicks is having moments. Of course, we did Jaden.
*  Caleb's been good.
*  And we don't know what we're going to get from Penic.
*  Caleb's been.
*  Caleb's been.
*  He looks at moments.
*  He's been. OK, you look pretty good last time.
*  This act 44 times.
*  It's the most since David Carr and his rookie year.
*  Like, I, Caleb, I can give Caleb a lot of mulligans on this season.
*  I feel like he's been given a tough draw this whole way, whether it be the offensive
*  line tougher than Drake May.
*  Fair, fair.
*  And you saw what Gruden said.
*  Gruden said he'd rather have Drake May than Caleb.
*  I'm like, it's all over the map.
*  I loved it. Gruden, adding we invited him the superstar, Drake May Island.
*  We're handing out condoms right now.
*  Or laughs. He has one.
*  But I do have to ask you, did we not?
*  OK, and I'm not trying to go and be viral for for everyone else here.
*  But did we not go down this road with Mac Jones?
*  You and I before. But this one feels a little different.
*  It feels it's completely different.
*  OK, Mac Jones, it was like really good game manager.
*  This guy can keep us going.
*  He can make some throws.
*  And this Drake May thing, he's doing it despite literally everybody else
*  in every fashion. And I also think seems like he's won the locker room over to our.
*  Oh, and how about he gets to the press conference two weeks ago?
*  It's like everyone put your phones down.
*  I would just like to say, how about that defense?
*  So it's great. Like the 22 year old.
*  Yeah. Now he's he's figured out all those pieces.
*  And you can tell, like from the other coaches and the players that are going
*  against them, some of the quotes, whereas like with Mac, it was like, yeah,
*  it's pretty good. You know, it's like it was never like this.
*  But Mac, I don't know what happened to Mac.
*  I still feel like there's a sliding doors universe.
*  And it really kind of started when Belichick benched him
*  for a lot of that win that win Buffalo game.
*  Remember that his rookie year when it was like Monday night.
*  Our wins Monday night kind of never the same.
*  But there was a he played a Colts, I think, on a Sunday night.
*  And the Colts just defended him a certain way.
*  And it was like it immediately broke him.
*  They just like they were like, throw over.
*  I think I remember. I think it was a Saturday game.
*  Saturday is a Saturday night game on NFL Network.
*  And like the Colts, just the defense and the special teams won the game for the Colts.
*  And it was like, oh, there's that's him.
*  I I would add, you know, with with with Drake May and you and I have talked about this.
*  I'm not sure on this podcast or just you and I talking like the Patriots,
*  they love this guy in the building and it goes from top to bottom front office.
*  Oh, like, I know the impression he made because I know a lot of the folks
*  in that building when he signed his rookie contract, he showed up
*  and all his brothers showed up and his high school girlfriend showed up.
*  And it was like this big deal.
*  And like I I got a text from someone in the building like
*  that's such a Schrager, stupid and tangible thing that if he stinks,
*  like what was the point of him talking about it like they loved it.
*  They're like, this is what we want.
*  We want someone who wants to put his roots down here and we can just build around this guy.
*  And he is as loyal as it comes to family, to his friends, to his faith.
*  It's all the right stuff on paper.
*  And then now you see it on the field and it's like, oh, these guys are going to rally
*  around this guy for 10 years.
*  He's when Nate Tice was comparing the L.A.
*  That was like the comp for it, because I couldn't quite get there.
*  The Josh Allen, because it was big enough.
*  All right. We talked too much about him.
*  I can't wait 10 years from now when he's bitter because 93 year old
*  Kraft is spending the least amount of money on the team out of the 32 owners.
*  It's like, I don't know.
*  Like right now, he's like in that young, loyal puppy stage that is just
*  so great to do. I do like I do like how this team has responded.
*  You know, we go back and forth.
*  I know you're you're you're the Patriots voice, but like Belichick and Lombardi
*  and and and Patricia were feeling themselves a little bit after that soft comment.
*  And they were joking and they were making their snide comments.
*  And I felt it. I understand.
*  Uh, they've won a couple of games and the players who they plan for Mayo,
*  whether or not he's an X or X genius or they have ping pong in the locker room or what?
*  This has been vacillating back and forth.
*  There is there's obviously Kraft and Belichick lines here.
*  And it's like, I don't know where I am on it.
*  But well, this was a better argument a week ago.
*  The coaching last week was an F minus minus minus.
*  I know it was probably the worst coaching they've had all year.
*  So I said it straight up. It's not been good.
*  But like they're alive dog this week, though.
*  They're plus seven in Miami.
*  And I don't know, I just think week to week, they're going to be really hard to predict
*  because they easily could be in the Rams last week.
*  You know, up on the Rams.
*  Yeah. By the way, let's talk about the Rams for a second,
*  because you're pretty wired in with them.
*  Yep. Pretty lucky to be at the Pats, a team that made a ton of mistakes,
*  that the coaching was abysmal.
*  Then they're playing the Eagles this week.
*  And all my instincts should be like, I'm taking the Eagles.
*  The Rams are kind of fraudulent.
*  And yet I kind of like McVeigh against the Eagles.
*  I don't know why. I don't know what it is.
*  But him against Fangio, like I love the way Stafford played last week.
*  I thought he was awesome. Like their receivers are back.
*  They can run the ball.
*  Williams is really crafty.
*  There were times when it felt like the Pats had him behind the line.
*  And he would just figure out how to get five yards anyway.
*  But and then their defensive line can can really collapse the pocket and do some stuff.
*  So I look at that.
*  I think that's one of the hardest games to figure out.
*  I don't know if I'm going to be putting a million dollar picks,
*  but are the Rams a playoff team to you?
*  That loss to Miami on Monday Night Football is really a slap in the face
*  to everyone who got on that bandwagon.
*  That's maybe the worst loss any team's had this season.
*  It's just surprising.
*  Like you had a couple of wins in a row.
*  You're back in this thing.
*  And then here come this Dolphins team who just kicked their ass
*  on national television in their building.
*  Patriots, they should have won. They did win.
*  It wasn't easy. You get back to this one.
*  Now, what the testament to the Rams is that Aaron Donald retires
*  and, you know, the thought is their defense going to go down.
*  They drafted verse.
*  He's probably your defensive player the all over the place.
*  It's either every week all over the place.
*  He's awesome.
*  Can't miss out on Braden Fiske's, the other one also from Florida State.
*  Second rounder.
*  Their third round pick was Cam Kinshins, who's had two huge picks this season,
*  the pick six against Seattle and another interception that game.
*  And then the game winning interception against you guys last week.
*  Then they got this guy, Omar Spates, who's undrafted.
*  It was number 48 and is all over the field and had the big fourth
*  down stop against Seattle and overtime.
*  Now, what I'm saying is with all this, it's like you could do that.
*  F them picks and you can be super aggressive and you can go and make.
*  You better nail the draft.
*  And they have nailed the draft and they found a way to recover from Aaron
*  Arnold retiring and no first round picks for the last seven years.
*  They've been really good with on that point.
*  McFaith said something interesting about how they didn't really scout me
*  because they knew they had no chance at them.
*  And I was wondering, like, is that an advantage when you either don't
*  have first round picks at all?
*  So there's people like, you're not even, you might as well just cross off 40 guys.
*  You know, you're not going to get, or you're just concentrating on a certain
*  portion of the draft versus like having to think about every round.
*  I do wonder if that's kind of a weird advantage that you wouldn't want,
*  but you kind of stumble into.
*  Sean had a really fun time this draft period.
*  Now quarterback was not going to happen.
*  They were fine with quarterback with Stafford, but like this was his
*  first first round pick ever.
*  So he was super excited.
*  And I said, I'm good morning, people.
*  I'm like, there is no chance that in his first time making a first round pick,
*  Sean McVeigh isn't taking an offensive player.
*  Sure enough, they took Jared verse.
*  It took a defensive guy second round.
*  Egg on my face.
*  The guy that he loved, though, and I could say it now, and it's it's been reported.
*  They loved Rock Bowers, the tight end at Georgia.
*  They loved him.
*  And when he started slipping, McVeigh was getting the the snappy fingers
*  and like that, what can we do? What can we do?
*  I believe they've made some phone calls to move up.
*  To get Bowers, it's a great what if because Brock Bowers is now having
*  the best rookie tight end season ever on an irrelevant teams, 10 to 13 targets
*  a week on his awful leave the ball.
*  Yeah. And and the fact is, that's what you're saying.
*  They weren't going quarterback.
*  But like McVeigh finally had a chance to look at blue chip talent,
*  first round talent in a real way, not in a well, there's a chance someone might slip
*  or we might trade up.
*  And he really enjoyed the process.
*  So as much as an advantage as it might be to to have a second round pick
*  and not have to worry about the first round so you can look at deeper cut lower.
*  It was it was cool for him to get that.
*  And then the Scouts, they were all in on verse credit to less need in his guys.
*  Like if verse falls that far, like we've got to find a way to get a new
*  cornerstone defensive player.
*  And I think they found him.
*  Well, there was that one year when they didn't have Coles,
*  they were looking at Coles Strange because they were like picking in the third round
*  and the Pats took him in my face like, wait, Coles Strange just went in the first round.
*  We were looking at him and a regrettable moment.
*  Oh, my God. We might have fucked that pick up.
*  Incredible that this guy went in the top 30.
*  He came out the next day and was like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
*  That's not what I was saying.
*  That's not what I was saying.
*  We were actually I don't think they had Coles.
*  Yeah, that nobody's believed you on that one.
*  But the flip side was he came all the way around on Drake Bank.
*  So the Rams are plus three sixty.
*  To make the playoffs.
*  That seems tough.
*  Seattle is plus two ninety.
*  To make the playoffs.
*  Arizona is minus one forty to make the playoffs.
*  And then the most shocking one to me, which isn't that shocking,
*  is the Niners plus money right now, plus one seventy six.
*  I want to talk about them really quick. Yeah.
*  McCaffrey doesn't look like McCaffrey.
*  No, didn't look. And it's the Niners are the classic.
*  Oh, if I if I saw the sheet of paper, I like, well, they have a lot of good guys.
*  But if you actually watch the games like Iuk's gone,
*  Kittles, Kittle missed last week.
*  So he said the George Kittle red flag stage of his season, which happens every year.
*  Debo's been hurt a bunch of times already.
*  Joanne Jennings had to make big plays last week.
*  But McCaffrey just didn't seem special to me last week.
*  And I don't know if it's going to take some time to come back or is this who he is?
*  I don't think their offensive lines is good.
*  I don't think their defenses is good.
*  And I feel like they're still getting.
*  Basically, last year's value being treated that way versus what I'm watching.
*  I don't think it's just last year.
*  I think it's the institutional knowledge that over the last five years,
*  they've started off being like three and four, two and three, four and four.
*  And then they they turn it on and they get to the playoffs
*  and they're really hard team to beat in the playoffs.
*  I, too, am watching them, though, last week against Seattle and.
*  Nick Bosa clearly hurt.
*  It's a hip. Another one.
*  Oblique, clearly not himself.
*  You don't have Eric Armstead out there anymore.
*  You're now a couple of years removed from from not having Buckner out there anymore.
*  All of a sudden, you look around, you're like, I don't even recognize this defense.
*  It's Fred Warner doing everything he can, as he always does.
*  It's an injured Bosa.
*  And it's a bunch of younger guys on the back end.
*  And it's like, I'm not scared of this defense like I used to be
*  when it was D'Amico, Ryan's and Robert Sala marching up and down
*  the sidelines, puffing out their chest
*  to give up an 80 yard drive to Geno Smith after you held them most of the game
*  and then especially that final plays like head scratching, not their way.
*  What's killing them is they lost a terrible,
*  terrible loss in Los Angeles where the receiver bell drops a pass
*  that would put the game away at 21 to seven.
*  That's in a division.
*  They lost to the Cardinals. That's in the division.
*  They've now lost to the Seahawks in the division.
*  You got to really dig yourself out of the hole, because I think their best way
*  to the playoffs is going to be winning that division.
*  Huge, massive, massive game this weekend against the Packers.
*  And to your point, they usually own the Packers and Shanahan's
*  had good numbers against the floor.
*  I think he's four and two all time. But I go to the big games.
*  I go to playoff games.
*  And I think where he most just scored another touchdown
*  from the NFC championship game back in 2020.
*  I remember a couple of years ago on a Saturday night, everyone.
*  Rogers was public enemy number one with the covid stuff
*  and everyone was taking shots at him and he comes in as the one seed.
*  And the Niners come in with with Trent Williams in a boom box
*  out of the locker room and they beat them in Lambeau and shock the one seed
*  on a Saturday night.
*  And it's like the Niners just have their number.
*  I don't know if it's that same Niners team.
*  The faces might be the same.
*  The coach might still be the same.
*  But like, do I have any confidence that that 49ers squad
*  that I've seen the last few weeks, limp to victories and just get by in their wins
*  and then lose strange games and never lose is going to come in
*  and just push around the Packers? I don't.
*  One more piece.
*  Packers almost beat them in that playoff game when it was a healthier Niners team
*  last year, probably should have won.
*  Yeah, that kicking, huh?
*  Little revenge game for them in this one.
*  And I'm with you. I think the Packers,
*  I think the ceiling of the team versus what we've seen.
*  I still believe in the ceiling and I don't think they played that well.
*  And I think they've had some weird stuff happen, really,
*  starting with that crazy Brazil game.
*  It was a weird way to say they got super lucky last week against the Bears.
*  They're also playing.
*  One thing that worries me about that game for them is.
*  They're they're playing on Thursday night, too.
*  They're playing the Dolphins, right?
*  See this huge game at home against the Niners.
*  But you also know that other game is kind of lingering.
*  It's thanks Thanksgiving evening, Thanksgiving night.
*  Yeah. And I always wonder like the game before the game.
*  The good news is they're playing the Dolphins that game.
*  Pretty mediocre.
*  Thanks. Dolphins have won a couple of games in a row.
*  I know. Yeah, but now they got Drake May coming to Miami.
*  There's also some weird weather stuff this week, too.
*  Now there's snow, snow and green day.
*  Jordan loves Leesley in interceptions.
*  Like, you're not wrong.
*  Like, they don't look crisp.
*  And then before the season, like Dobbs got suspended for a game.
*  Like, there's been a little gaming at times. Right.
*  And and like, you know, I don't know if it's a positive or negative.
*  Now, in the early 2000s, the Patriots had this where it was like,
*  you didn't really have a true number one wide receiver.
*  And the floor said that before the season.
*  Like, we look at all those guys, number ones.
*  But every week, it's like Jayden Reed's week.
*  Then it's Dobbs this week. And last week, Watson went nuts.
*  So I kind of like that.
*  There was a Tucker Kraft week.
*  Oh, Tucker Kraft killed the Rams.
*  And then the next week had to touchdown.
*  It's like he does nothing anymore.
*  It's OK. It's all right.
*  He'll find us saying Josh Jacobs, obviously, is a weapon.
*  And like, we could just list names.
*  But to me, it's they haven't even come close to gelling on offense yet.
*  And they're still seven and three.
*  And they're perfectly where you want to be like, let the Lions get all the headlines.
*  Let the Vikings be sitting there with a tiebreaker over that.
*  Like, let that be there and then stretch run.
*  Here comes the come running team and the come running team
*  might very well be the Packers who got their shit together at the right time.
*  Right. Maybe as a five seed, maybe as a six seed.
*  We're aligned on this one.
*  There's a scenario in my head this weekend where.
*  I'm trying to think of the narratives on Monday morning as you're staring at Kyle.
*  Yeah. Where it's like Packers.
*  Whoa. Do we believe this?
*  Niners. Oh, no.
*  Like, they're not going to make the playoffs. Holy shit.
*  And then there's this sneaky Lions game.
*  And I'm going to full disclosure, I'm putting the Lions in a tease.
*  But it does have like, does it?
*  You know, it's a little sneaky.
*  Just it's a little sneaky because Richardson, I thought, played pretty well last week.
*  And I thought in general, the Colts played pretty well.
*  And, you know, everyone's so high in the Lions right now,
*  coming off this giant win.
*  And I think they can run the ball over them.
*  I'm not worried about it.
*  But I was just wondering, like, could this be one of these weeks?
*  Yeah, we're like, hey, Packers only a game back.
*  Totally. And like one of these weeks, the Lions are going to have that game.
*  But, gosh, they I thought the Titans might have gotten
*  because Titans came in with the number one defense.
*  They let them out.
*  I thought the Jaguars may be playing for Doug Peterson's job
*  with all that stuff beforehand.
*  Oh, I'm glad you brought him up.
*  Because that was the thing.
*  I was that was the thing I was the most wrong about this season was
*  like the Jets.
*  I walked in with with eyes wide open, fully knowing it was 50 50.
*  I really believed in the Jags as.
*  And AFC Playoff team.
*  So did I. So did I.
*  And for me, it came down to them versus Denver for that last spot.
*  And I couldn't get there with Denver because of the defense.
*  Ironically, their defense statistically has been awesome.
*  If you looked at it before the season, it's like, I don't see it.
*  What's in here?
*  And I thought Jacksonville.
*  Meanwhile, it's been the opposite.
*  They're one of the five worst teams in the league.
*  Doug's doing the dead man walking.
*  They didn't even fire him after a 52 to six loss.
*  They still might.
*  Like we're doing this on Thursday.
*  They've got biweek.
*  Like, I don't know how that's going to go down.
*  Well, this is going up fast.
*  So maybe if this happens Thursday night, the pot will be up.
*  You think it's still in play?
*  So I think it's still in play.
*  I think after that loss on Sunday and all the reports that aren't coming
*  from nobody that he was on and he's on the death watch anyway.
*  Like I did a biweek.
*  Who knows what the cons have going on this week?
*  They might be wrestling or something else going on that they wanted to deal with
*  in the first part of the week.
*  But like, I certainly don't think I would be sleeping great if I'm Doug Peterson.
*  Now he knows they Friday, Saturday.
*  He knows what's going on.
*  Yeah, it's got a statue.
*  Does there any other coaching situations we should just be monitoring?
*  Maybe guys not about to get fired, but situations that
*  seem a little rockier than maybe it seems to the outside.
*  Like, are we cool with Cleveland these days?
*  What's going on there?
*  It's fine in Cleveland, two time coach of the year.
*  And I know the relationship he has with ownership and there's like full trust in him.
*  So I think he's fine.
*  There was a erroneous report that Dable was on the hot seat.
*  I don't think that's true.
*  I think Dable's set in New York.
*  Do we watch the Bears?
*  The next time we watch, is that already a wrap?
*  We watch the Bears.
*  We see how they respond.
*  Anytime you fire a coordinator and things don't get better.
*  The next person is not the other coordinator.
*  Like, that's the stuff that we look at there.
*  Should I start doing that?
*  Should I start firing inner circle people when I don't like what's going on to deflect blame?
*  Does this work in the outside world?
*  Not your fault.
*  I don't know what's going on over there.
*  That's it. This podcast is a weird strategy.
*  I've had to change my offensive coordinator.
*  I think you're the head coach.
*  You know, the sick part about that was Thomas Brown called a really nice game
*  for the Bears last week and Caleb looked good and energy was hot.
*  And it's all for naught. Like they still lost.
*  Well, but think about one of the things like in the stories and the dialogue after.
*  It's like Thomas Brown simplified it for Caleb to get rid of the ball fast.
*  He got rid of the ball within three seconds.
*  It's like, why didn't you do that three weeks ago?
*  I could you could have asked me just called me cold called me.
*  I would have told you he was holding on the ball too long.
*  I needed a new offensive coordinator to figure that out.
*  I'm a McVeigh guy.
*  Obviously, Thomas worked for McVeigh for many years over there in L.A.
*  And before that was a University of Georgia running back and before that,
*  played high school football against McVeigh.
*  So like McVeigh's been singing about this guy for a decade.
*  So he goes and gets his job at Carolina, a big promotion flames out horribly.
*  Everyone gets fired.
*  He goes to Chicago and it's like he finally gets a chance to be an offensive
*  coordinator. And like he was high energy.
*  He was let's go.
*  And I'm wondering, I'm like, you know, Shane Waldron, also respected guy,
*  like and Matt Eberfluss, those are not like high energy.
*  Those are not big vocal guys.
*  Meanwhile, you look at the booth and Thomas Brown is like super into it.
*  He's pumping his fist.
*  And I'm like, as stupid as that sounds, like sometimes the young quarterback
*  needs that just a little bit of juice.
*  Like, let's go.
*  So I'm curious to see how the rest of the season plays out, plays out for him.
*  That's like what you did with a million dollar picks that year.
*  We're not on a slump. And you came in, you just had a ton of energy.
*  Midseason edition, baby.
*  Let's go. Well, Joe Brady
*  seems like he's emerged as a possible head coaching dude.
*  You have the Chargers defensive coordinator, mentor in the mix for stuff.
*  You have Belichick.
*  You have Raybo. You have Ben Johnson, who I think just wants to sit at the bar
*  in a cocktail dress and have people buy him drinks.
*  I'm not sure he actually not even everyone wants to be head coach.
*  Not even like two years ago.
*  He was a Carolina guy and Tepper was like in on Ben Johnson.
*  Like he didn't even take the interview. He's like, I'm good.
*  Last year, I have been on pretty good sources.
*  He was Washington's guy.
*  Yeah, they get on.
*  They get on a private jet to Detroit to go meet with him again.
*  And they find out while they're on a private jet that he's withdrawn his name
*  from the interview process and he's going to stay in Detroit.
*  Like, I don't even know if he wants to be a head coach.
*  And I don't think he was like loves the idea that he's looked at as this guy
*  who flirts. He doesn't even flirt. He's like, I'm good.
*  So I would imagine this is the year, but he's he could be he could be picky here.
*  I don't think he needs to take any job.
*  This is the year.
*  And I doubled down on it with my future picks before the year.
*  But I was just like, I just I'm defaulting to good coaching.
*  You know, like Sean Payton over Jim Harbaugh.
*  I know it doesn't make sense, but I just feel like he's getting to nine wins
*  and maybe make the play.
*  I had him. I had them both in the playoffs this year.
*  I'm with you.
*  Next year already.
*  I can just tell you, like Belichick and Vrebel taking over whoever.
*  I'm just going to be like, I'm in on those guys.
*  Why are you so convinced Belichick's getting a job?
*  Well, that's a good question. I'm not.
*  I'm convinced he wants a job.
*  If he didn't get one this time around and in Atlanta, obviously,
*  went down the road with him.
*  Why after a year will he suddenly be in demand?
*  Great question, because especially coming off a not a great path here,
*  I think I think Kraft was definitely poisoned in the well a little bit.
*  I think he had a reputation as a curmudgeon and as a control freak.
*  And I think the two jobs that made the most sense for Atlanta, Washington,
*  Atlanta hired Rahim, who's, you know, was a really, really,
*  really good defensive coordinator who was going to get another job.
*  Like it wasn't like the hard to schmuck and Washington Dan Quinn.
*  Like it seems like that was the right hire.
*  I got it for them. Great energy defense.
*  Like it's worked out.
*  I don't really know if there's another job like like Tepper
*  wasn't going to hire him in Carolina.
*  This year, Jacksonville and Vegas seem like the two spots that.
*  OK, so you're bringing Belichick, you're bringing his whole infrastructure.
*  He's going to be in charge of everything.
*  You're just handing the thing over to him.
*  Those seem to be the two franchises that just need someone like that.
*  So let's go down the Vegas line.
*  Brady, Brady, hires Brady's first big opportunity.
*  Brady's hiring his Belichick, his old head coach,
*  and they're going to bring in Josh McDaniels and Mick Lombardi
*  and the whole gang from like they did that a couple of years ago.
*  Like that was their coaching staff.
*  They went the New England route.
*  Like the only thing I would push back on is,
*  are we sure Brady's going to be that involved?
*  Good point. I don't know.
*  Like you could tell me either.
*  You could tell me he's going to be super involved.
*  I would imagine.
*  He just got a deal on a 10 percent NFL team and he's just kind of like,
*  who does this benefit more, Brady or the Raiders to have Brady
*  as a Raiders minority owner?
*  I would think the Raiders would say we would love his insights
*  and have him weigh in on decision making when it comes to Brady.
*  Because he got an unbelievable deal apparently in the team.
*  He's got some legitimate half price like the owners are pissed about it.
*  Jacksonville needs, I mean, if I think for able,
*  because he's younger than Belichick, should be a better candidate
*  than Belichick as much as I love Belichick.
*  He's hitting his mid 70s.
*  Yeah. But I do think that's been a lot of this media stuff.
*  It's been a rehab tour of.
*  See, I do have a person now.
*  So interesting. I can play the game.
*  Surrounds himself with Chris Long, who's a super likable guy on television,
*  a Chad Johnson on television, and he's playing along with those guys.
*  And he's on with the Mannings and he's great.
*  And he's doing McAfee like he's checking all the boxes.
*  Totally. And look, if you're talking about who do you want to sit down with
*  and talk ball with or who's going to be the best X's and O's guy
*  in the history of the sport, it might be him.
*  I know these owners.
*  I'm trying to think.
*  I think Shad Khan is your best bet of like who's going to hand things over
*  to Belichick and whether or not he has a whole bunch of other stuff going
*  and doesn't want to manage it day to day.
*  You deal. Right.
*  I just you take it, you go.
*  Which is, I think what he thought he was going to have a trampolkey.
*  Right. And that hasn't worked out.
*  Yeah. And he thought he had that with Urban Meyer.
*  And that didn't work out.
*  I think Belichick's going to Jacksonville and I think Vrabel
*  will get a really good job.
*  I can't imagine he's not going to be head coach next year.
*  That's crazy to me.
*  So he's been he's been talked about, obviously, a lot.
*  And a lot of people thought he got a real deal in Tennessee, which is fair.
*  He's won a lot without a real true number one quarterback.
*  Tana Hill was solid for a couple of years.
*  I think about very well, he's in Cleveland right now consulting,
*  but it's that's almost like, hey, just let me stay with the team.
*  Let me stay in the mix.
*  You can't pin any of Cleveland's season to bad season to like,
*  well, look, Vrabel had a bad year again, though.
*  Vrabel like former patriot, all that.
*  Like is Vrabel the Jets guy?
*  I don't know if there's a if that's a great fit in New York.
*  I don't know if he wants to go there.
*  I'm I'm just trying to do mixing, matching about what's going to be available.
*  And I look at some of the places that are going to air openings.
*  I think Bears might be available.
*  I think Cowboys is going to be available.
*  I think Jets is going to be a job.
*  It's tough. It's tough because he's going to be involved.
*  Three giant contracts.
*  It's basically like you're taking over and 76ers.
*  And the owner historically has been very well.
*  They haven't had a real voice of like pushback or resistance since ourselves.
*  I mean, I don't think Wade Phillips was that guy.
*  It wasn't Garrett and it wasn't McCarthy.
*  Those guys have been great football coaches in their own right.
*  And when they had to be, but like they're not guys who are going to scream at the owner.
*  Yeah. I think last year, last year, Vrabel would stand his ground.
*  Last year, the Chargers was the best job.
*  100 percent. You get you get Herbert.
*  You have a team that underachieved because of the coaching situation.
*  You have actual talent in place.
*  It was all lined up for somebody to come in.
*  Jacksonville to me is a pretty good job.
*  You still believe in Trevor Lawrence.
*  Yeah. If you if you're walking into it going, I think Lawrence can be a guy.
*  I think he could be on the somewhere in the Herbert Mae vicinity.
*  He's just they did this on this run and this run.
*  We can build him back up.
*  And you're probably watching every pass and play that he's done over the last four years,
*  trying to decide if this was his fault or if this was the infrastructure.
*  But at least like you go to the Giants.
*  Who am I getting? Tommy DeVito?
*  Like you go to Vegas, you get no chance of these guys.
*  Draft. Yeah, that's what you're getting.
*  Or Chicago would be the other one where you get you're walking in with Caleb.
*  You have draft capital.
*  You have a city that gives a shit.
*  That's kind of what Canal is stepped into in Carolina.
*  If you get like a Caleb that just had a scarring rookie season,
*  how do I build him back up?
*  You know, like Bryce Young was destroyed last year.
*  How do I build him back up?
*  That's a challenge in itself. Work in progress. Work in progress.
*  I would I would quickly give you a name.
*  And obviously, I say this and a lot of people roll their eyes
*  because he's been meant he was a head coach before.
*  But like, depending on how the second half of the season goes in Washington,
*  I think Kingsbury is going to be a name to watch because of what he did with Jaden
*  out of the gates. And he's got head coaching experience.
*  It's not for everybody.
*  It's and he has faded in the second half of every place he's ever coached,
*  whether it was Texas Tech or Arizona or even, you know, USC last year.
*  But I would keep an eye on Kingsbury as a sneaky candidate
*  for a few of these places just because of his ability with these young quarterbacks.
*  And that's what you're drafting.
*  And I do think, you know, he was bad in Arizona.
*  I don't know how much of it was his fault, but it didn't go well. Yeah.
*  Yeah. With that said, he's been amazing for Daniels.
*  And if you feel like it's a quarterback match, maybe it's going to.
*  It's the thing is you have a 25% chance of hitting it with the coach.
*  We were just watching it.
*  There's eight or nine guys and then there's everybody else.
*  Totally. Yeah. That's what happens.
*  Like, would you want the New Orleans job?
*  The shocking thing to me is how many jobs I wouldn't want that are available.
*  I go, cool. I get to take over the Panthers.
*  If that became available. No, thank you.
*  Oh, the Saints. I get you.
*  I get the sense.
*  You're underestimating the egos, the careers
*  and what it means to be one of the 32.
*  And a lot of these guys know going in sometimes.
*  But not if you're Ben Johnson, though.
*  Not every year you have your pick.
*  Like, it's like, oh, cool. I get to coach Derek Carr.
*  Oh, I get to aid in O'Connell for a whole year.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Sean Payton tells the story about like he
*  he got interviewed by the Raiders in 03, maybe.
*  And he was the offensive coordinator of the Cowboys and Al Davis made the pitch.
*  And then, you know, the Cowboys came back and said,
*  we'll pay you as much as they're paying you to stay as offensive coordinator.
*  And he does.
*  And then the next year he visited New Orleans and he was like,
*  there were still tarps on the homes from Katrina.
*  And like we were embarrassed to invite free agents in
*  because if they even saw this place, they would never choose to sign.
*  He's like, we had to offer twice as much money to assistant coaches
*  just to even consider this place.
*  Is that it's not like that.
*  But when you go into these teams that are so much behind the A.P.
*  like it is a real, real hard sell to like a top top coach,
*  which is one of the reasons why you don't get
*  some of the premier coordinators or the hot names going to these franchises.
*  Everyone's like, all the fans are like, well, let's just hire that guy.
*  No, no, no. A lot of times it's the coordinator has the choice
*  or the hot name has the choice.
*  And it's like, I'm not going to go step into that.
*  I want to go to the place that's the most desirable.
*  Well, it's funny the way we laid that out.
*  Maybe Vegas is a more desirable job because you come in and like, hey, Vegas, no state tax.
*  Hopping city right now, doing great.
*  We have the NBA is coming.
*  We got a baseball team coming.
*  NBA is coming like shit's going down NBA Cup and they do the UFC.
*  NBA Cup like shit's happening.
*  Are you going to go to the are you going to go to the NBA Cup again this year?
*  No, I'm on the fence.
*  The semifinal game, there's the two in a row games on a Saturday.
*  Seems kind of fun. But I will be at
*  I'm doing a double dip this weekend. I'll be in L.A.
*  I'm going to go to Nuggets Lakers on Saturday.
*  And then I'm going to go to and then I'm going to I know I'd like to see him.
*  And then I'm going to go to Eagles Rams the next night.
*  And then I was thinking about extending the trip one more day
*  because you have Ravens Chargers.
*  So pretty good L.A. sports weekend here.
*  That really is.
*  Well, let's leave on that because we're hitting that a million dollar picks.
*  Ravens Chargers Chargers sneak one out last week.
*  Like it was a sneaker slayed some ghosts.
*  Ravens could be seven and five if they lose this game.
*  The Ravens are favored by three.
*  And I've liked the Chargers all year.
*  But something about the Ravens on turf coming off a loss is scary to me.
*  What's your take on this game?
*  I don't know, man. Chargers are really good.
*  And last week, it was obviously all written
*  just Charger it up and they found a way to somehow put their foot down
*  and not let that happen again.
*  Now, of course, the kicker from the Bengals misses that kick.
*  And it's OK.
*  But it was all going the way it always goes for the Chargers after being up
*  27 to six, and they found a way to hold on.
*  And Herbert had to leave a drive at the end.
*  Yeah, he did. And like it.
*  And at the end, it's like
*  Lad McConkey has no demons and no ghosts from, you know, previous years.
*  And J.K. Dobbins doesn't know any of that stuff.
*  And they've got guys on defense who weren't a part of those teams like
*  new coach, new feel like I could see them beating up on the Bravens this weekend.
*  The Ravens Ravens last week.
*  They finally get a good effort from their defense.
*  They finally get this performance where they keep a team under 20.
*  And on the flip side, they only run the ball with Derek Henry 13 times.
*  They missed two Justin Tucker field goals.
*  They look discombobulated after the timeout on the two point conversion.
*  There's penalties all over the place.
*  Like, I don't feel great about this Ravens team.
*  I don't feel great when they won against the Bengals on a Thursday night.
*  And they give up 35 points and 500 yards passing like I don't know.
*  I know the Ravens are favored in the schemes on the road for some reason.
*  I could see the Chargers winning in this game.
*  100 percent. It's a must watcher.
*  That one's great. Packers Packers Niners is going to be great.
*  Some good ones. Rams Eagles will be fun.
*  We have a couple of good ones.
*  I think Dolphins Pats could be really fun, too.
*  I heard you and Sal joking about, you know, did you know that the Buffalo fans
*  jump through tables? Where do you stand on the Harbaugh brothers
*  going up against each other in a game?
*  Are you good on that story line or is it not enough?
*  Is that what's happening?
*  Yeah, they actually so one of the teams, they're going against each other.
*  I didn't see that.
*  Nobody's talked about that all week.
*  It's actually kind of interesting because one of them is last name Harbaugh
*  and the other one's last name is Harbaugh.
*  And their dad actually coached, too, for Western Kentucky for many, many years.
*  Same guy.
*  How many times did they coach against each other when Harbaugh was a Niner?
*  Twice. They did a Thanksgiving game and then they did the Super Bowl.
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah, the Super Bowl.
*  And John won both times.
*  I still don't understand how the Niners lost that Super Bowl.
*  I went to that game, one of the weirder sporting events.
*  I'm sure you were there to the long blackout.
*  The whole thing was, where did you say?
*  Because I maybe I'm just the neurotic New Yorker here, but the lights go out.
*  Everyone thinks this is hilarious.
*  I was freaking out. I'm like, what's going on?
*  Like, where were you when it went down?
*  I was in the press box, which is not easy to get down from the top of the Superdome.
*  I was in a suite with the one and only Nathan Hubbard.
*  Yeah. And and the lights went out.
*  And the first thought is like, is something horrible happening?
*  Then the second thought is, what if the lights don't come back on?
*  What happens to the Super Bowl?
*  What we did, it was super disjointed, but the whole game was disjointed.
*  And then all of a sudden, they're on the five yard line first down.
*  And it just the pace was off and it was really weird to watch in person.
*  I it was I haven't been through like a million NFL games
*  because I love watching them on TV.
*  But that was, I think, the weirdest one I've been to in person.
*  Frank Gore runs the ball down to the five yard line.
*  Kaepernick throws, I think, three passes to Michael Crabtree.
*  One of them may be the Randy Moss, of all people who was on that team
*  out of the end zone. And that's how it ends.
*  It's a crazy, crazy Super Bowl that's forgotten in the lore
*  because of the the blackout.
*  But it was it came down to the final minutes.
*  And like, that's another one that Niners fans add to like
*  there's a whole version of the beleaguered Jets, Browns fan.
*  And no one's crying for Niners fans.
*  They've got all those Super Bowl rings.
*  But like they have had some devastating playoff losses over the last two decades.
*  Yeah, you're right.
*  You don't think of them as the tortured fan base
*  because they've been in it every year.
*  But what was the last one? Ninety ninety five.
*  Yeah, well, yeah, it was Steve Young and the monkey off his back with Gary Plummer.
*  Yeah, that was the last time they won a Super Bowl. Right.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Montana won four and Steve Young won one.
*  Drought on par of the New York playoff football drought.
*  Thirteen years for the Jets.
*  And I was one of the last Giants playoff when was it Super Bowl?
*  Now, a couple of years ago, they beat the Vikings.
*  They beat the Daniel Jones game. I bet on that game.
*  You didn't talk. We didn't talk about the Giants decision.
*  Oh, you're not going to talk all your locks.
*  Number two, the veto gets the call.
*  But they're just trying to save money, right?
*  It's just no game.
*  No, the veto brings a spark, baby.
*  Let's go for what they should want to lose every game.
*  If I were them, I would play Daniel Jones every game.
*  There's like I want to I want the weird thing is the drafts goofy
*  because the top two guys, it seems like are cornerbacks, right?
*  If you say Travis Hunter is a quarterback,
*  you can play receiver sometimes, and then there's not a quarterback in the top eight.
*  Wow. The two left tackles.
*  Just get ready. Just get ready for the Shador Sanders hype train, my friend.
*  It's coming. It's coming.
*  It'll be real. It'll be real.
*  I'll be getting off that train.
*  You know, you're not a fan.
*  No, I like them. It's just we do this every year with the draft.
*  We're settling with like these are definitely the five, six, seven best guys.
*  And then as we get closer to quarterbacks, everybody starts talking them
*  into these quarterbacks. Yeah.
*  It starts rising up.
*  All right. Million dollar picks week 12.
*  I'm not happy with how we did last week, considering we love the Broncos
*  and Chargers, both those hit.
*  We really like the Colts and the Jets and somehow did the wrong bet.
*  We did a bet with the Colts plus three and a half with Richardson's rushing.
*  And then he had the ball a ton rushing and somehow didn't hit the 38 and a half.
*  And then we had the Chiefs in a tease chiefs up to plus eight
*  and chiefs plus three and a half another tease.
*  And that game was a one score game and they didn't win.
*  I have no regrets about putting the Chiefs in the teeth.
*  No, no, I do regret listening to you on the Browns.
*  That was a mistake.
*  That was a mistake. Don't talk about it.
*  We're we're moving on.
*  So week 12, there's three games I like in a parlay.
*  I like which one do you want to hit first, the parlay or the three games?
*  Let's let's say the parlay for last parlay is like dessert, right?
*  It's like the nice Sunday at the end,
*  because we're taking all these nice parts and put them together.
*  All right. So Schrager and I in part one of the podcast
*  talked about this Packers Niners game.
*  Packers are minus one and a half at home.
*  They almost beat the Niners last year in the playoffs and really could have.
*  They've been a team that we all kind of like from a talent standpoint
*  that has not really totally put it together again.
*  But what we have always seen primarily with the NFL
*  right around Thanksgiving time, somebody starts making a jump.
*  And some people would think that's going to be the Niners.
*  And I just don't see it.
*  I think it's been a year from how I didn't like the way McAfee looked last week at all.
*  Kittles banged up their defenses in the same.
*  And from a narrative standpoint, house,
*  I could see this being a game where the Packers take care of business.
*  We officially realize it's not the Niners year.
*  And we start thinking about this Packers team as a possible.
*  All right. Maybe they'll give the Lions a good game in the playoffs game.
*  What don't you like about that narrative theory?
*  That the Packers don't look like a team to me that can take care of business.
*  They are messing around, playing around,
*  f***ing around with their food every week.
*  And I think it is because Jordan Love is not 100% healthy.
*  We haven't had that real Jordan Love breakout game
*  that became the hallmark of that Packers team.
*  The second half of last season that also coincided
*  with Aaron Jones ripping off a bunch of honey yard.
*  So they don't have, they have the back.
*  It is Jacobs, but we haven't seen sort of that two headed monster.
*  They get vertical with Jordan Love because he's got all the time to get to those receivers.
*  The receivers, the core is still great.
*  The receiving core is still great.
*  And Jacobs will get his yards sometimes in certain circumstances,
*  but we haven't really seen the full rev of that.
*  Can I give you the game that we were, we did see it because it was a while ago.
*  Let's hear it.
*  Week six, Arizona.
*  Love threw four TDs.
*  They beat Arizona 34 to 13.
*  We chalked it up like, wow, it's Arizona.
*  Arizona's been really good since that game.
*  And now I look back to that week six and I think.
*  That was a pretty good win, because then after that, they play Houston.
*  They win by two.
*  They play at Jacksonville.
*  They win by three.
*  Kind of a stupid game.
*  They play home against Detroit.
*  They lose by 10, but Detroit's the best team in the league.
*  Much worse than that.
*  And then they play last week against Chicago, and it was a play your
*  with your food game against a team that had a new offensive coordinator.
*  And I thought the Bears played really well in that game.
*  But they did get it done at the end.
*  So I guess my theory is they're a little undervalued.
*  I think San Francisco is still a little overvalued because I think people
*  keep waiting for the real San Francisco to show up, and I'm not sure it's there.
*  And maybe this is the week I think they should be favored by two and a half or three.
*  So I feel like I'm getting like a free point or point and a half.
*  So the crazy thing is the line was two and a half earlier this week.
*  But I think that was a hedge because the reports of Purdy Purdy
*  was doing limited practice and he's got a sore shoulder.
*  And there was some speculation about whether or not he was going to play
*  in this game. The fact that it's moved down to one and a half seems like some
*  money's come in on the Niners that suggests that Purdy is going to going to play.
*  And if that's the case.
*  Injured George Kiddos, who said he's going to try to play.
*  Yeah. Well, that makes me nervous.
*  What do we know? What do we think about both?
*  Joanne Jennings, both a little compromised.
*  Well, both. I mean, it seems like it might be game time decision
*  whether he plays or not.
*  And then in Lambeau against a team that feels like they should have
*  beaten him last year and has something to prove.
*  I like the spot for the Packers. I'm in on this bet.
*  I'm going to let you do it.
*  We're not going to have a disagreement.
*  But you're still like a little afraid of Niners.
*  Yeah, because they have all that talent.
*  We haven't seen McCaffrey yet.
*  And that they are.
*  But that's my point is, I don't think McCaffrey is healthy.
*  He may not be. So it's like you saying like, I don't.
*  We haven't seen him beat yet.
*  It's like, I don't know if we're seeing him beat for a while.
*  Like, I don't think to me, McCaffrey doesn't look like McCaffrey yet.
*  I think that's kind of fair.
*  I'm worried about seeing him this week.
*  Packers minus one half a market net down.
*  Cardinals, Seahawks.
*  Cardinals are getting one and a half in Seattle.
*  There's some some weather stuff, maybe with this game
*  that makes me a little nervous with Kyler Murray and bad weather.
*  In general, the Seahawks going from seeming like their season was over last week.
*  They get the huge drive from Gino against the Niners,
*  which is another bad sign with the Niners that they gave up that long Gino drive.
*  And and now they're playing the Cardinals at home this week.
*  And they have a chance to really reinsert themselves in this race.
*  We have Seattle bets from before the season.
*  I think I might even have them win the NFC West, which could be still alive.
*  But they win this game.
*  I'm a Cardinals believer. I think they're good.
*  They really won me over the last few weeks.
*  And the thing I like about this house is you have Seattle's defense.
*  Twenty seven against the run in Arizona with this physical pounding
*  running game they have with James Connor.
*  I just like they can run the ball, run the ball, run the ball.
*  And even if you're going to like Seattle in this game,
*  then maybe it's an Arizona first bet Seattle for the game,
*  like plus 800 type thing.
*  But I think Arizona can beat them.
*  I think this this is another narrative game to me where we come out of and go
*  Arizona, I think they're for real at the same time.
*  Seattle's ability to throw the ball and run the ball
*  and come from behind, which they did last week, scares me a little.
*  So where do you stand?
*  It's a 50 50 game.
*  We talked about this on East Coast bias.
*  Raheem Palmer and I were heads up.
*  I preferred Arizona.
*  And the dream is on Seattle.
*  My issue with Seattle is that is the least trustworthy offensive line in football.
*  Each of the times that I've tried to come up with a basis for Seattle,
*  you know, taking advantage of somebody, it's born out of the idea
*  that they can establish the run and they sometimes can
*  and sometimes can't and most of the time can't.
*  Part of the reason to prefer Seattle would be the return of DK Metcalf.
*  And really, I mean, Smith and Jigba has been incredible,
*  both from a fantasy perspective, but most importantly,
*  from a chemistry perspective with Gino.
*  So the question for Arizona is, can they put pressure on Gino
*  because the spits are crazy with Gino when he has time.
*  And that really was the thing that Seattle was able to take advantage of
*  down the stretch against the Niners, Nobosa and Gino, you know,
*  got really comfortable with the lanes he could run in and the lanes
*  he could see to throw the ball in.
*  I don't really have a strong feel.
*  I express a preference for Arizona, but I certainly could see
*  Seattle dream said that in his his model, these teams are dead even.
*  So it really does.
*  Well, then we'll take the point.
*  Yeah, I just want to point out Seattle's last five of their last seven.
*  Sure. Sure.
*  They came within one San Francisco stop, but that being six to seven.
*  Yeah, I I'm happy to to be wrong on this.
*  And if so, lose some money.
*  But I like this Arizona team.
*  I think they know who they are and they can run the ball.
*  And I think they'll be able to pressure Gino and make a couple of mistakes.
*  And I just think they're better.
*  It's just a defense for Arizona. That's right.
*  They've been on the right side of like variance, a bunch of like games
*  that they've won by one or two points.
*  Twenty first pass defense in Seattle, a second with the pass.
*  And as you mentioned, Smith and Jigbo has been been a revelation last week.
*  He was awesome in that last game like they were going over and over again.
*  I'm going to mark the Cardinals down.
*  That's fine. Ravens Chargers.
*  My first instinct was I really like the Chargers.
*  And the more I stared at it and the more I stared at it,
*  I keep coming back to this question.
*  Are the Ravens really going to go seven and five?
*  That's going to be their record after after week 12.
*  There'd be seven and five.
*  I don't want to do this because we had a conversation
*  the very beginning of the season.
*  We were looking at teams after week one and said, here's the list of teams.
*  You know, we were looking for some some there were some giant lines out there.
*  And we're like, are the Ravens really going to go all in to other Ravens?
*  Right. Lose to the Raiders.
*  Yeah. The mother. And they did it.
*  They did it. Sons of bitches.
*  So I don't want that to be the rationale.
*  Well, can I give you this?
*  They have four losses.
*  They lost to Kansas City on the Isaiah, likely stepped on six inches of the line game.
*  They blew that Vegas game with their up 10 in the fourth quarter.
*  And that's the weirdest result of the year.
*  I would put it against any other game.
*  They dropped the game winning interception in Cleveland.
*  Fucking guy dropped it.
*  And James ends up going down and getting it, but he just threw them
*  an interception, they didn't catch it.
*  And the Pittsburgh game was stupid.
*  I mean, I loved it because I had Pittsburgh, but missed multiple field goals.
*  Like, it was just one of those games.
*  What happens? That's what happens in those games.
*  And then I look at the Chargers, who I think are a really good team
*  for, you know, as a home team, I get it.
*  I had them last week, but
*  I feel like the the the Ravens can just run on them and move the ball.
*  And you think about how easily Burrow was able to just move the ball
*  in the second half against the Chargers.
*  Why wouldn't Baltimore be able to do that?
*  That's the thing to me.
*  So I don't think the Chargers are really good team.
*  I think they are.
*  Maybe it's just a really good surprise team.
*  Exactly. Perfect.
*  Perfect way to put it, because it is incredible.
*  They tried their goddamn this to charger the F out of that game.
*  Right. But but hardball.
*  And then whatever's going on inside the locker room with those guys, they just
*  did enough to not charger the outcome of that game.
*  But I thought that what we saw in the second half when Cincinnati,
*  I mean, it really was a game where like whoever has the ball
*  at the end of this game is going to win this epic game.
*  And they could not under any circumstances slow down
*  that Cincinnati offense, slow down Joe Burrow.
*  And I really think that which one's the younger?
*  Who is is is.
*  I thought Jim was older.
*  Jim's older, I think.
*  And Jim is the Charger coach, right?
*  Yeah. Oh, my God.
*  House, really?
*  No, I think John's older.
*  That's why you're confusing me.
*  I'm pretty sure John's older.
*  I'm confusing you.
*  You thought Jim Harbaugh was maybe not the Chargers coach.
*  That was a John Harbaugh older brother.
*  I think it's John.
*  John Harbaugh's older. Good call.
*  There we go.
*  Try to make fun of me because I don't know which is which.
*  Big brother, little brother. I like it.
*  It's a rematch of the Super Bowl.
*  Big brother had his way.
*  I I. So you're saying if you coached against either of your black sheep
*  brothers, oh, my God, it's a guaranteed win.
*  Just backhouse with any money.
*  Not only that, but I would be looking for an opportunity
*  to put my nuts on their forehead.
*  Absolutely positive.
*  There'd be no doubt.
*  These guys, we might have to have both of the House brothers
*  on at some point just so people know they exist.
*  I can assure you they're available.
*  Wait, is with Dickhouse ever come on or when we have put about a seven second delay?
*  Definitely with delay. Yes.
*  Yes, for sure.
*  Well, Baltimore, I love the Ravens.
*  I mean, you know, we can cut to the chase.
*  Yeah, because they have the 30 second pass defense.
*  But what we saw from the Chargers last week, the receivers, they're OK.
*  They're really getting they're eking out the most they can get out of it.
*  But there's still some moments where like, oh, yeah, that's right.
*  You're Josh Palmer.
*  And oh, yeah, that's right.
*  You're Justin Herbert. Remember, like for a quarter and a half.
*  Yeah, right.
*  I we know who you are, buddy.
*  We know all you've got the great.
*  Wow. I don't want to make the nerds mad now.
*  Don't make the nerds mad. I actually like him.
*  I think he's like terrific.
*  And all the reports like he's a golf guy, like I'm into Justin.
*  I like that shot they had before the game of him
*  of Harbaugh pounding his pads and just yelling at him.
*  And he was just going, I like that.
*  But he'll he'll disappear for a quarter in a heartbeat.
*  Let there be no doubt.
*  I just can't get past the Ravens going seven and five seems crazy to me.
*  And I think they're going to be able to move the ball up and down.
*  The Chargers knocked it in play last week.
*  The Chargers defense doesn't seem as crazy good as it was five, six weeks ago to me.
*  I agree. All right.
*  That's our third one.
*  And then I really want to work the Broncos into something.
*  The Broncos are that line is now up to six and a half in Vegas.
*  No way. No, can't do that. That's way too many points.
*  Well, we're going to put them in a parlay.
*  Thank God. That's a relief.
*  Vegas is offense. This is really something.
*  So Amir Abdullah was trending as a roster trend in fantasy leagues this week
*  because he has a chance to be the running.
*  And I was like, Amir Abdullah feels like he's been around.
*  He's 31. Wow.
*  I would have thought I would have guessed like 25.
*  So he's like almost Zeke Elliott's age.
*  He's going to be the running back.
*  Their quarterback situations and debacle.
*  They have no receivers.
*  It's just Brock Bowers over and over again.
*  Yeah. Which I'm pretty sure Sean Payton is aware of Brock Bowers.
*  I don't know how the Raiders.
*  Denver's defense, it's first yards per play, second sacks, third hits.
*  Vegas can't block.
*  I get that it's in Vegas, but and you also have Denver coming off
*  a big win last week, but I just don't see how I think Vegas might be done.
*  They might be a short for the rest of the year until we get to some sort of weird
*  Christmas situation.
*  So Broncos with the Chiefs in Carolina, they're favored by 10 and a half.
*  Chiefs coming off a loss.
*  Yeah.
*  Carolina's defense, 30 second against the run and 31st on first downs.
*  Just feels like the Chiefs will move the ball and do Chief stuff.
*  So Chiefs down to minus two and a half.
*  Broncos Moneyline.
*  And then your team.
*  The Washington commanders, a.k.a.
*  the C words.
*  Yeah.
*  Favor by 10 and a half against the Cowboys.
*  Can we can we just have them win by three?
*  Can we have Casey win by three?
*  Washington wins by three in the Broncos win.
*  That is plus one or three on Fandoul and I would like to do it.
*  I love it. That's a that's a dessert parlay.
*  Three nice ingredients pulled together to make beautiful harmony in our in our
*  mouth, in our mouths.
*  If it was a.
*  So what are you doing for your for your dessert?
*  Are you a pumpkin pie guy for Thanksgiving dessert?
*  What are you putting in your mouth for that?
*  I love pumpkin pie, but I also really love pecan pie.
*  Oh, great.
*  And what I like to do is is get a slice of each and then eat both and even mix
*  the bites.
*  Let me let me recommend that you add one more because this is all.
*  Have you had sweet potato pie?
*  Oh, sweet potato pie is great.
*  Magnificent.
*  Yeah, I would I would totally add that.
*  So you're going to a Minaj pie.
*  Yeah.
*  Forget it, man.
*  We can do this in proper Thanksgiving style.
*  That sounds great.
*  I want to give out my all of my thanks to those sweet potato pie, pumpkin pie.
*  And pecan pie.
*  And pecan pie all together.
*  I want to bomb that one.
*  Call that one the Joe House is asleep on the couch pie.
*  Because that's what would happen about 14 minutes after that's a full pie parlay.
*  That's what that is.
*  We're getting the pies ready.
*  Everybody's getting the ingredients.
*  Everybody's going to the store this weekend to pull it together.
*  We'll be going to the store this weekend with all the extra money in our pockets
*  from that right.
*  The little pie parlay, baby.
*  Yeah, that's all right.
*  We'll make that the pie parlay.
*  I was thinking I watched the Sopranos every night for a good a bed because my
*  wife's asleep.
*  And and so I finished season four or five, six, seven.
*  And then I was like, you know what?
*  I don't know. I'm going to stay with these guys.
*  I circle back.
*  Started with one of them.
*  So Pine Barrens was on last night.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Which, you know, is the legendary Sopranos.
*  You can't really go to bed after you watch.
*  No, I was so fired up.
*  Yeah.
*  And I was like, oh, watch 20 minutes.
*  I don't watch the whole thing.
*  But they're in the car and Chris finds the ketchup packets and he gives them the
*  ketchup packets and there's relish.
*  Paulie Wall.
*  That's the funniest character of all time.
*  I think he's funny comedy guy and he's eating the ketchup and he's like, mix it
*  with the relish, mix it with the relish with the ketchup packets and the relish
*  packets.
*  And that's what made me think of the pumpkin pie, sweet potato pie, pecan pie
*  is the Paulie Walnuts mix it with the relish dessert extravaganza.
*  Mix it.
*  Mix it with the relish.
*  Prissy outrageous.
*  I'm going to lose my foot before we go.
*  Before we move on.
*  You don't have any interest in this Philadelphia L.A.
*  Rams game.
*  I because folks are, you know, I see I've seen some some arguments on both sides
*  and people are really arguing, you know, be careful.
*  It's a be careful situation.
*  And, you know, especially Jalen hurts these nuts.
*  You know, you want to you don't want to be a me.
*  To me, I had it marked down as a stay away.
*  OK, OK, because I thought the Pats absolutely could have beaten the Rams last
*  week and they did some of the dumbest shit.
*  We blitzed staff for the whole game.
*  There were stats afterwards after selling.
*  I did the pod that they single covered Cup and Nakua basically all game,
*  which gets how that turned out terribly.
*  Right. Right.
*  Mayo is just couldn't have been less aggressive in the worst possible
*  situations and and yet the Pats had the ball, the chance to win the game.
*  I just think the Rams look that good.
*  I'm with you and I don't keep waiting for it.
*  Well, that that that's it, especially, you know, the
*  Jalen hurts these nuts has not been as accurate.
*  He is running great.
*  Yeah, his legs look great.
*  But here's the test and why I understand why people are advocating
*  in favor of the Rams.
*  The home their home dogs, first of all, they're plus two and a half.
*  And the Eagles secondary deserves the plaudits that's receiving
*  from the draft or those two rookies.
*  They've been playing very well.
*  But this is an entirely different class of offense.
*  If this offense really gets going that the Eagles are up against.
*  So I just wanted to make sure we talked through it, didn't have a conviction on it.
*  So the case is.
*  They they kind of went straightforward last week
*  because they knew that the Pats game, knowing this Eagles game was coming
*  McVeigh against Fangio, this is a kitchen sink game.
*  I that's one of the reasons I like the Ravens.
*  I think the Ravens, it's a kitchen sink game.
*  Love it. Because great.
*  You have seven and five. You're out of the AFC North.
*  Now you might be like a six seed.
*  You know, and you kind of need to you need the game and the
*  the six seed is going to get either Buffalo or the Chiefs in the first round.
*  No part of that playoffs. Lord have mercy.
*  And the Rams need every game because they're in a dogfight with all those
*  NFC West games. So I do wonder if like that's why it's a state way, though,
*  because I can talk myself into each side.
*  There was one other game I really liked.
*  You're going to make fun of me.
*  The Pats are plus three, 10 in Miami.
*  I'm not making fun of you. I think it's funny.
*  I think that that line's crazy.
*  I understand it, but, man, I'm not betting against Drake May.
*  Give me let me have Drake May in a touchdown. That's fine.
*  It's seven and a half.
*  Yes, I was wondering, is there is there.
*  I mean, they're so stupidly coached that I almost feel like you
*  should take the money line and which team
*  the but well, both teams.
*  But there's like you can get May for 200 plus yards.
*  The Pats to win the game.
*  And Drake made two passing touchdowns is six to one.
*  I was Drake May one passing TD,
*  200 yards passing Pats win the game is plus four, 11,
*  which doesn't really buy that much value from the plus three, 10.
*  I just didn't know if there was some sort of Drake May with the Pats bet
*  that we wanted to think about.
*  I'll let you think about it.
*  I'm going to I know that I'll just play the side on the Pats.
*  I'm not laying those points with the Dolphins. It's crazy.
*  You're not laying the seven.
*  You like the seven with the Pats or do you like the plus three, 10?
*  Fuck it. Bet.
*  No, no, I prefer the the the points.
*  The plus seven. Yeah, I prefer the plus seven.
*  All right, Sam, million dollar picks week 12 heading into
*  Thanksgiving, House's favorite day of the year.
*  Is there anything even close to Thanksgiving for you?
*  No, nothing rivals it.
*  I think you I have a lot of people in my life who love Thanksgiving,
*  including me, including nephew Kyle.
*  You're number one. You love it the most.
*  I've seen you be be worried that you might have to be driven to the hospital
*  because you ate too much.
*  You passed out multiple times.
*  You drink too much. You eat too much.
*  If you if you die from overeating, over drinking, it will be on Thanksgiving.
*  Everybody will understand.
*  So like how's that?
*  Was it Thanksgiving? It was.
*  Million dollar picks week 12.
*  We lost three hundred fifty five thousand dollars last week,
*  and it was really because of the chiefs, because they didn't cover a couple of teases.
*  I'm fine with it.
*  It was did you say it was the fifth time in one hundred twenty four games
*  that the chiefs have lost by more than eight points?
*  It's fine. We were on the wrong side of a historic event.
*  We are still up four hundred thirteen thousand dollars for the season house.
*  And we're going to put two hundred K on the following bets.
*  The Baltimore Ravens minus three on the road against the L.A.
*  Chargers are the Ravens going to go seven and five.
*  I don't think so.
*  Can they throw all over the place of the Chargers?
*  I do think so.
*  Is there a big brother getting revenge on his little brother house?
*  You're a big brother.
*  I mean, it's not even getting revenge.
*  It's just taking advantage of what's rightfully yours.
*  That's right. You were first.
*  Your little brother's exactly right.
*  Yeah, you were first. And that's it.
*  Chargers great win last week.
*  Some some holes, some things that we saw we didn't love.
*  I just think the Ravens,
*  they're not going seven and five.
*  It's too ridiculous.
*  They've already had four dumb losses.
*  They're not going to five Ravens minus three.
*  That's our first one.
*  Cardinals plus one and a half in Seattle, Seattle,
*  a great, somewhat lucky win against a banged up Niners team that last week to
*  save their season.
*  I think the Cardinals run the ball all over the Seahawks.
*  I like their defense.
*  I think they lose that game in week six to the Packers.
*  And since then, I like the way they look house.
*  I think they're going to win the division.
*  We're both in.
*  Yeah, Cardinals coming off the bye week.
*  And if you look at the last 10 games of the Seahawks at home,
*  their against the spread numbers are not very good at home.
*  The 12th man might need to step it up a little bit.
*  12th man in trouble.
*  Maybe roommates with Joel Embiid Packers at home minus one and a half
*  against the Niners almost beat them last year in the playoffs.
*  Couldn't do it.
*  Catching a Niners team at a really nice time.
*  I think this is a shell of the Niners team.
*  We think it is.
*  You're on your own on this one.
*  You're not against it, but you're letting me you're letting me do a guitar solo.
*  That's it.
*  I believe in the talent on this Packers team.
*  They killed Arizona in week six.
*  I think they're due for another really good game.
*  Fans are going to be fired up.
*  Atmosphere is going to be great.
*  Weather won't be awesome.
*  I like the spot Packers minus one and a half.
*  So put 200K and all three of those.
*  And then we have a little parlay for you.
*  Bring in the Chiefs in Carolina down to minus two and a half.
*  Bring in your Washington Seawords
*  against the carcass of Dallas Cowboys down to two and a half at home.
*  And then the Denver Broncos, a team that did us really nicely last week
*  that we've won some money on this year that we really appreciate.
*  Bo Nicks making a run at offensive player of the year with your guy, Jaden Daniels.
*  Fine. We're going to take.
*  The Broncos money line in Vegas against a terrible Vegas team.
*  You put those three together, Broncos, money line chiefs, minus two and a half
*  Washington, minus two and a half plus one oh three.
*  Good. 200K on that.
*  200K on that. Yes, sir.
*  It is the pie parlay after all.
*  And then last but not least, because it's Thanksgiving and House is feeling generous.
*  He's allowing me to Drake May parlay because I love Drake May playing in Miami.
*  May podcast. He doesn't need a player pod.
*  This is it. Well, the line's too high.
*  And this past team might might be deficient in certain areas.
*  They might be poorly coached.
*  Maybe they might make them mistakes every week, but they almost beat the Rams last week.
*  And I think it's worth a flyer.
*  Pat's plus seven and a half.
*  Good. Like the extra hook.
*  That's a nice one.
*  Drake made 200 plus passing yards.
*  Drake may over 26.5 rushing yards.
*  That's two scrambles.
*  Yeah. Roll them out there.
*  Maybe in the first half, Drake made one passing touchdown.
*  Just one. OK. OK. Plus three forty one.
*  We are putting.
*  50K on that. 50K. Good number.
*  That's right. Good. It's a it's a little sprinkling.
*  The Drake makes full facial.
*  Well, it's the Drake may almost like the pie parlor you talked about earlier.
*  A pecan pie, sweet potato pie, pumpkin pie.
*  That's Drake made 200 plus yards over 26 and a half rushing yards.
*  One plus passing touchdowns.
*  Hop on the Drake may bandwagon right now.
*  Those are the million dollar picks for week 12.
