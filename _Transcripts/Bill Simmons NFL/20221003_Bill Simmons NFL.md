# The NFL Failed Tua Tagovailoa | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaQRITR9HcE)
*  Can we talk about to it really quick?
*  It's been beaten to death the last five days of Rhett Lee Stowe because this was a terrible story.
*  We were on this podcast last week talking about how we thought he was concussed and whatever.
*  She's the NFL.
*  So Chris Nowitzki, who was on my is at the forefront of the concussion stuff and he's done
*  incredible amounts of good stuff.
*  He was on my podcast at ESPN.
*  I think at least once he's a great Twitter follower and he tweeted before that Bengals
*  Dolphins game.
*  If two it takes to feel tonight.
*  It's a massive step back for concussion care in the NFL.
*  If he has a second concussion that destroys his season or career, everyone involved will
*  be sued and should lose their jobs, coaches included.
*  We all saw it, even if they must know this isn't right.
*  One of the things that Christa has done a lot of work on and all those concussion guys
*  that starts in Harvard, it's great.
*  And I think the work they've done, they've been getting brains for a long time and it's
*  just really, really valuable.
*  And we've learned a ton from them.
*  One of the things we've learned is like, if you get a concussion, you come back too soon,
*  you get another concussion.
*  It's like worth five concussions.
*  It's like when your brain isn't healed yet and gets another one, that's when you get
*  real damage.
*  You can recover from a concussion, but you need to recover from it.
*  And you get the second one.
*  And that's when, you know, so his whole thing is like, if somebody gets too that close
*  together, you should just be out, you know, for months.
*  I'm going to be so interested to see how they handle the when should to a come back part
*  of this, because they're still claiming he didn't have a concussion initially, but he
*  definitely did.
*  And then the second one, he's, he had the clenched fingers thing, which was just awful.
*  And even if they say, no, no, he's feeling better.
*  I just think, I think he should be gone.
*  I'm not just saying this like from a competitive thing, because the Patriots are in that
*  division.
*  This is just like somebody's life.
*  I think he should be gone for at least six weeks.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, number one, you can't leave it up to him, right?
*  Like when they're saying, no, he watched, he watched this movie with the team and he
*  was laughing like, oh, stop with this crap.
*  This is, this has nothing to do with anything, right?
*  Like, Hey, put his pants on and don't worry about it.
*  He buttoned them and everything.
*  It's like, no, you screwed up.
*  We're going to see somewhere that he had two concussions in four days.
*  That video, we saw him last week walking off against the bills between plays.
*  We've all had back injuries.
*  I know you've had a back injury.
*  You never buckle like that after a back injury, right?
*  That's what they claim.
*  Now injury was his back.
*  Yeah.
*  You don't, you don't become like one of those, uh, in front of like a car wash, one of those
*  balloon men guys.
*  It was disgusting.
*  And then same thing.
*  And I was out and so I'm watching and I thought I'm like, oh, he mangled his finger.
*  Is that what I saw?
*  Cause I wasn't like paying attention.
*  I was like out of the event and like, oh, are you kidding me?
*  No, that's, that's at least six to eight weeks.
*  Like I said, on their own before the NFL steps in and says, no, no, no dolphins.
*  You're about to be fined again, uh, for another ludicrous thing.
*  Now that said, I do think some people are hypocritical about this, like on Twitter,
*  like people who have said, oh, let them play maybe not with head injuries, but people
*  definitely want in general, they're, they're stars to play hurt, to try to play hurt.
*  So there's a little bit of hypocrisy here, but when it's head injuries, I think, um,
*  anything goes and you got to protect these guys.
*  I think part of the hypocrisy, which I think belongs to all of us is
*  that Thursday game snuck up on everybody.
*  First of all, he went back in in the second half and it didn't pass the smell test for any of us,
*  but only like Kristen Winsky is the only one I saw who just came out and was like,
*  this is the most fucked up thing I've seen in a long time.
*  This has to, they can't allow this to happen.
*  And then it happened.
*  I didn't, maybe if there were people out there that were doing that, I think for the most part,
*  people were like, oh, maybe he didn't get a concussion.
*  I think we're, we were benefited the doubting too much.
*  With a league that, um, even though it's made the game a little bit safer, I wouldn't say
*  they're exactly, uh, they're exactly, uh, caring for the players.
*  And what about it's, and it's right in our face that, that, that highlight of him,
*  like, it's not like he went under the blue tent and couldn't remember his, you know,
*  his mother's name, maiden name or something like, and they hid that, like that was there
*  for everyone to see it's disgraceful.
*  Yeah. Like if you have, you fall under those best fight videos on Twitter or anywhere else,
*  or any of those, you said those YouTube clips or whatever.
*  And when a guy gets punched like that and they'll like stagger around two seconds later,
*  that's basically what he did.
*  Like he tried to get up and the first time, not the second time, try to get up.
*  And then he's like, you know, he had wobbly knees.
*  It was like a boxer when they're giving them the 10 count and he's trying to,
*  he's trying to stand up, say he's fine.
*  And then he's not fine.
*  And the ref will just stop it.
*  Um, the whole, this wasn't a Roy Jones Jr.
*  thing where it was like pretending he was not just the guy, right?
*  Or Rick Flair.
*  That it certainly wasn't right.
*  No Rick Flair.
*  Well, it was a terrible story.
*  And the league has been able to skate on these for a while because people love football.
*  We talked about this at the beginning of the year.
*  The league is like immune to this stuff.
*  People during the pandemic, people are so happy to have football back.
*  Everybody gives it a wide, wide swath.
*  But in this case, they almost can't let to come back until they know he's like 170%,
*  not even a hundred percent.
*  He needs to be like able, he needs to be like goodwill hunting at a fucking chalkboard,
*  doing math formulas and speaking multiple languages before I would feel good about sending
*  him out there.
*  I'm telling you all the, all the work on this is two concussions in less than a week.
*  Like this is like what happened to Eric Lindros.
*  This is what's happened to a bunch of different athletes who were just never the same.
*  Fucking Antonio Brown in a hotel room in Dubai.
*  Remember that concussion he took?
*  I don't feel like he was ever the same since then.
*  In that playoff game, he got knocked out cold.
*  Like he was out.
*  He was like unconscious and he was, I don't think he was ever the same after that.
*  There might be like 45 things wrong with him.
*  I don't know.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But you don't know the concussion.
*  Britney Spears territory where we can't even make fun of him.
*  But one thing's for sure.
*  We can't let to decide on his own when he's ready to come back.
*  Right.
*  That's maybe if he's able to feel Louis K's text on a Sunday morning, like that'll be a
*  nice step forward.
*  Like, all right, this guy's wits about him.
*  Well, like if your son, if your son got a concussion playing football,
*  yeah.
*  How many weeks would you say there's no fucking way you're playing?
*  Because I've thought about this.
*  I've talked about this with my wife.
*  We had an agreement that it was going to be one and done.
*  And then then you see the excitement of the game and that they're five and one.
*  And he's making an input.
*  He's making an impact like blocking extra points and stuff.
*  And then it clouds your judgment.
*  It's easy.
*  That's what I mean.
*  It's easy to be hypocritical about it.
*  But yeah, I would definitely if he's woozy and like staring at his eggs in the morning.
*  Yeah, I want him out for a while.
*  Like, you know, the whole rest of the season, probably.
*  Yeah, it's at least weeks.
*  That's what the NFL, these guys get concussions.
*  They're back in like five days.
*  You know, we just had one last week.
*  I forget.
*  Was it one of the receivers?
*  Duvernay, the Ravens.
*  He had a concussion.
*  He was like, oh, he's feeling better.
*  He's going to play this week.
*  He's just got a concussion.
*  He's feeling better.
*  What does that mean?
*  So they got to completely overhaul this.
*  And the one thing the league has shown, and this is not praise.
*  They'll fuck things up like royally.
*  They'll do like the dumbest.
*  They'll do almost the opposite of what they should do.
*  But then when enough people notice, they will like kind of be like, oh, man, all right.
*  And then they'll put in some sort of policy.
*  They have fixed stuff.
*  But it's like you have to beat them over the head with it to get them to fix it.
*  No pun intended.
*  And the right people have to be upset about it or the wrong people.
*  Right.
*  So like COVID, I think you could have COVID on Monday at this point and get in the game Sunday.
*  I'm not sure if that's true.
*  I have, I think you could have COVID like the week before, you know, three days leading up.
*  If you pop a negative, you're good.
*  This changed over the couple of years.
*  If you compare that to head injuries, that's insanity.
*  Right.
