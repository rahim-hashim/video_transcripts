# Why Donâ€™t We Have a Super Bowl Favorite Yet? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isf9iM3hOIc)
*  I want to start here. It's week eight and I don't know who the favorite in the NFL is.
*  And I was looking at the Fandl odds and I don't remember everything being over four to one for all the teams.
*  It might've happened before, but I just don't personally have a recollection of that.
*  Casey is the favorite at plus four fifty and San Francisco's there.
*  But like, why don't we have a favorite yet?
*  Is it injuries? Is it just the league is deeper?
*  What is it?
*  I have a couple thoughts and it's not like I'm giving you a thesis statement or dissertation,
*  but if I can provide a couple thoughts, I think it'll lead to good conversation.
*  The first is all of the really good teams have lost in prime time or big national games when everyone was watching.
*  And I think that takes a little bit of the luster off these teams and makes the odd like if these were losses at one o'clock,
*  it might be different. But we watched Casey lose to Detroit.
*  So we're like, well, they're not invincible.
*  Then they played Denver on a Thursday night and the offense didn't click.
*  So you're like, all right, Casey, I don't feel the same way about Casey.
*  But everyone watched those two games.
*  Philadelphia goes up and plays against the Jets in the most watched Fox game of the year,
*  which was that late window.
*  And everyone watched Jalen Hurts throw three interceptions with 28 million people watching in the second half.
*  So, yeah, Philly, what the Bills have now lost to the Jets without Aaron Rodgers.
*  Philly's six to one, San Francisco's five to one, Casey's plus four fifty.
*  OK, keep going.
*  The Bills have lost to the Jets without Aaron Rodgers and then look terrible against the Giants in a Sunday night primetime game.
*  And then they went to London where everyone did wake up and watch that morning game.
*  They couldn't get out of bed and beat the Jaguars.
*  And the last one is the Niners. You're going into this thing and it's like, all right, we've been watching the Niners win by 20 every single game.
*  They get on primetime against the Vikings and they lose.
*  So I think that's maybe the the betting side and the the external media side from a football standpoint.
*  Oh, boy, I don't know if the football has ever been more, you know, just head scratching in a lot of ways.
*  And I think it might be a quarterback thing.
*  And I think about Buffalo, Cincinnati.
*  I'm listening to teams here. Casey. Dallas, I put in Miami and Philadelphia, and I'd say those teams are set at quarterback, right?
*  Other than that, you either have bridge quarterbacks, you have declining quarterbacks or you have a rookie quarterback.
*  And Purdy with San Francisco is the one that's like an outlier.
*  But I think that you're looking at this quarterback thing.
*  It's like, OK, if you have a set quarterback that we know is good, you'll.
*  But other than that, that's only like a handful of teams.
*  That means there's a bunch of gobbledygook in the middle.
*  And you could say, yeah, well, cousins, I'm talking about the guys, the guys you talk about.
*  Yeah. And if those teams all pick each other off, it's a quarterback thing.
*  And there's so much turnover year to year in offensive systems and the way we want to do things that I honestly think the quality of play at the quarterback position,
*  as much as we did a Netflix series this summer, we talk about these young, talented guys up and coming.
*  I remember growing up and you can pick out 12 to 14 quarterbacks that were like the same guys for eight years on a team.
*  And like, those are just the guys.
*  Did you just do a when I was growing up? Yeah. And my growing up, my my.
*  You're officially like, yeah. How old's your kid now?
*  I have a seven year old son. I like this.
*  You're turning into like you're broaching toward middle aged media.
*  Remember, I wake up and I'm like, I send you a card.
*  Let me tell you about Jim Everett and Chris Miller in the NFC West.
*  I think you really need to hear about these showdowns between Bobby Abert and Joe Montana.
*  But yeah, you had no, I like your theory, though, because I was trying to do my power pole.
*  First of all, I couldn't believe that I Dallas at seven.
*  You have to. I don't like Dallas, but I had so the favorites are Philly, KC, Baltimore and San Francisco.
*  But I don't know who the actual favorite is.
*  I usually like to put somebody in that in that spot.
*  And I went with Philadelphia.
*  Because. I think I trust their infrastructure the most with their offensive and defensive lines,
*  and they have a couple of playmakers and they have the tush push and like Devontae Smith,
*  who's been in a coma for five weeks, if you had him on your fantasy team, you're like just completely panicking.
*  But I still think he's a good football player.
*  I'm sure they're going to get a go one of the weeks. They're getting Goddard going.
*  They're always going to be able to run the ball.
*  They're still adding like they had a buyer from the from Tennessee.
*  They just stole him for nothing.
*  So I think I trust them from a talent standpoint and from I think it could go sideways in the least possible ways.
*  KC, Baltimore, San Francisco, I'm not going to trust Baltimore yet.
*  I want to see Lamar play three straight healthy months.
*  I should have Baltimore in the in the quarterback conversation, by the way, if I was a double back,
*  I don't think I had him listed because I was doing a free.
*  Yeah, that's fine. But to your point, they you know, they went to London and they beat Tennessee,
*  but they did it with six field goals like. Yeah, it's you know, a lot of people watch that game.
*  So as much as the one o'clock Fox game where they crushed Detroit is everyone buzzing right now.
*  All right. Well, we saw different versions of them a week before.
*  So that makes it hard to be like they're the favorite.
*  And you don't want to be prisoner of the moment, which is what essentially we are in the media.
*  Well, especially because the season is one third of a year long now.
*  And I do wonder if the length of the season ties into this because every game can't be a big game
*  when the season is 18 weeks, including the buy.
*  And you're going to let down, you're going to go up, you're going to go down.
*  I have to trade it at number five still.
*  OK, I thought last week was it was a real humbling experience.
*  And it was and they were out of it immediately and they got their asses kicked.
*  But I'm OK with that.
*  I don't think that's a team that's built to play from 14 points down.
*  OK, and I just think they got their asses kicked.
*  I also think the running game situation with them was not ideal.
*  You know, it's a bad week. They were banged up.
*  And it just they they caught Baltimore in the wrong week with the with the wrong kind of team situation.
*  I still have them fifth.
*  I have Jacksonville six, which I can't believe because I actually think they might lose to Pittsburgh this week.
*  That was seven. I have Miami eight and Baltimore nine.
*  Miami's had so many injuries now.
*  I'm starting to wonder if it's going to hit the point of no return.
*  They got their asses whipped by Philly last week.
*  Buffalo's lost too many people.
*  And then I have the Michael Myers Steelers at 10.
*  Our team, that's our team, too.
*  Four and two.
*  They're once again underdogs against Jacksonville this week.
*  Most of the money is on Jacksonville.
*  I I just watched my East Coast bias guys today.
*  All three of them were like, love Jacksonville.
*  Oh, my God. Oh, family play.
*  And, you know, how many times do we have to watch it with them?
*  They're going to be five and two in four days.
*  You know, Pittsburgh, they'll 56 minutes into the game.
*  You're banging your head against the wall.
*  And then you look at the final score and they won by three.
*  And you're like, how they do that again.
*  And it's not it's at some point.
*  It's not a coincidence. Yeah, it's not.
*  The other thing I want to say, the other thing about like the league wide stuff.
*  And I was talking about the quarterback position, but the new CBA
*  put in a lot of rules.
*  And I know this is like maybe Lombardi can go bigger on this.
*  Or if you have on someone who's coach, you know, going back into the 90s,
*  offensive linemen and defensive linemen, they do not do like one on ones
*  in practice anymore.
*  So the offensive linemen come in and by and large, they're not great anymore.
*  And you come in, these guys come in from college and a lot of these college
*  offensive lines and linemen are taught, you know, bullshit.
*  And you've got to on
*  wire their mind on how they played offensive line in college football
*  and then teach them how to play NFL.
*  And you can't do it in practice because you can't do one.
*  You can't do it in training camp.
*  But then week three, you need this guy to start at right tackle.
*  And he hasn't ever played in an NFL game.
*  I think that stuff matters.
*  It's not sexy.
*  It's not as easy as saying the refs suck.
*  But it is something that the offensive line play is atrocious right now.
*  And the defenses are dominating in every which way at the line of scrimmage.
*  The people that love college football always talk about how there's a certain way
*  a lot of these college football offenses play,
*  where it's just like shotgun snap, throw the ball quickly.
*  They just kind of learn how to block one way and that's it.
*  And then they get to the NFL and they have no idea what they're doing.
*  They you know, one other piece, I don't know how major this is,
*  but it's definitely not nothing.
*  They clearly changed the concussion policy this year.
*  And if you get a concussion, you're out for the next week.
*  You just are.
*  Brock Purdy got a concussion Monday.
*  We're not going to see him.
*  They're low. Maybe you're out.
*  And it does feel like it's clearing out two guys per week on,
*  you know, in games.
*  So maybe it'll be one each one on each team, two on one team, whatever.
*  But I've noticed that more than usual, that guys are just scratched.
*  You know, I think I think the league responded to people crying on air
*  and tweeting nonstop when two went down and was still in the game.
*  And I think if it's an overcorrection, it's because they're playing it safe.
*  But I'll give you an example.
*  The Jets right before the game last week, it's it's like, all right,
*  so gardeners still in the concussion protocol.
*  Well, then he had a bye week and now we're coming out of the bye week.
*  And I don't know.
*  I can't give you the measure of his kind of like it's Thursday.
*  We're recording this both he and D.J. Reed, the starting corners.
*  They're both, you know, sauce still is in the concussion protocol
*  and still has not been clear to play.
*  And I think they're being very safe about that.
*  But that's your best defensive player. That's huge.
*  Right. In the old days.
*  Hey, sauce, get back out there. Yeah.
*  How's your head feel? OK, you're good.
*  You know, the other thing with the league and this usually happens
*  when we get to the teens, but I had just my rankings were Cleveland
*  11, even though they have no quarterback, Seattle, Cincinnati.
*  I think there could go either way.
*  I would I would look at it since the schedule.
*  I'm pretty worried about them being able to turn around
*  because every week they're playing a banger.
*  Seattle's same thing. They have some tough games coming up.
*  They got San Francisco twice in three weeks.
*  And then you have Houston in the Rams at 14, 15 and Atlanta at 16.
*  And then it drops for me, at least Tampa Jets, Minnesota 17, 18, 19.
*  Then you get to the Chargers at 20. I'm crossing them off.
