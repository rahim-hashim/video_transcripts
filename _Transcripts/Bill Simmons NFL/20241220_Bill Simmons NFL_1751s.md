# Million-Dollar Picks Week 16 With Joe House  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [December 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw)
*  Art house week 16 is here. We had a rough week 15 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=0.0s)]
*  Fine first time I got my ass kicked by a weekend in a while lost five hundred ten thousand per million dollar picks [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=4.0s)]
*  But we're still up for one point two five four [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=9.64s)]
*  Million and I like a lot of the stuff this week [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=12.84s)]
*  The only thing that really changed for me last week, and I was just wrong like Pittsburgh Philly [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=16.0s)]
*  Whatever like some of the losses like whatever. I just had the wrong side I get it [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=22.02s)]
*  Seattle Green Bay had way wrong. I thought like this is the time Seattle is gonna [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=27.2s)]
*  Show everybody that they might actually be like a little sleepery and instead Green Bay absolutely kicked their ass and Green Bay [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=32.56s)]
*  I almost wish I had gone into that game thinking one of these two teams is going to emerge as the NFC sleeper [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=39.16s)]
*  I was shocked by how they got their ass kicked. What did you think of that game? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  So here's my overreaction to the entire week [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=50.68s)]
*  And it really does you know it's expressed most perfectly by that game [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=54.36s)]
*  I will confess just for myself [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=59.24s)]
*  I got lulled into a sample size that wasn't really reflective with that Seattle defense and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=61.72s)]
*  Throughout the card in week 15 [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=69.68s)]
*  I chose the defense over the the offense and in each instance the superior the team with the superior offense [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=71.84s)]
*  Beat the crap out of the team like really Pittsburgh. Yeah, Green Bay, Seattle [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=79.4s)]
*  Yes, Tampa went on flow Detroit. That was another one right right right Tampa Chargers [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=84.4s)]
*  I stayed away from that thank God yeah the Seattle defense [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=90.4s)]
*  They had they had done Arizona twice and the Jets and the Niners when they were banged up and it made us [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=93.96s)]
*  Kind of threw us off a little bit so they were they were good numbers [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=100.68s)]
*  They were like yeah [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  You know look at all the ways that they've improved and they had health and you know they were very [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=104.64s)]
*  It was a compelling case. It just didn't hold any water [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=109.88s)]
*  Yeah, so when I was going through the games this week. You know look if I'm gonna lose a week [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=113.88000000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna go back to the drawing board [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=119.12s)]
*  I'm gonna I'm gonna get back in the lab try to figure out how I can get better [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=121.02000000000001s)]
*  And I was really looking back really trying to go over some of the numbers versus the schedule and who played and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  So like we have these Saturday games Texans Chiefs [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=130.96s)]
*  Mahomes isn't playing [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=134.36s)]
*  Texans are favored by two and a half [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=136.04s)]
*  Mahomes comes back it seems like now it's Chiefs by three and a half in Houston and the numbers would say [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=138.56s)]
*  Hey [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=146.64s)]
*  Watch out for Houston in this game [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=147.72s)]
*  they have the number one defense and DVO a like they're gonna be able to really pressure the Chiefs and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=149.56s)]
*  they just haven't played enough good teams and they haven't looked good in the games they played and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=156.04s)]
*  I'm just looking at this going are the Chiefs really gonna [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=161.72s)]
*  They're really just gonna lose in Houston to this Houston team that can't seem like they can stay out of its own way [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=165.12s)]
*  Offensively that can't really block [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=170.72s)]
*  and definitely unquestionably has a good defense, but [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't want to say they're the good bad team, but they're kind of one level above that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=177.56s)]
*  But below the Chiefs Ravens bills level you know what I mean [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=182.28s)]
*  so this game to me was the most [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=185.12s)]
*  confounding and the hardest for me to try and choose a path and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=187.52s)]
*  I'm halfway inclined to bet on Houston and grab the Houston money line on the possibility [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=193.44s)]
*  That all of the Mahomes stuff is [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=200.8s)]
*  Smoking mirrors every because Kansas City is smart enough to try and give itself an advantage on on everything [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=203.72s)]
*  So part of the advantage would be having Houston's defense prepare for Mahomes and then come out with the Wentz game plan [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=209.8s)]
*  I wouldn't put it past Kansas City in any way shape or form [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=217.32s)]
*  The challenge is [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=221.36s)]
*  The Chiefs defense stinks their secondary is bad, and they haven't been able to do anything since week eight [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's you know look at the numbers. They're a bottom ten past defense [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=230.96s)]
*  So it's a this is stay away from you it is [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=234.46s)]
*  I mean even though I think in the second half especially Joe mixing these nuts [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  Joe mixing these nuts [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=243.32000000000002s)]
*  Like that's that's the pathway Houston yet score in the second half so if they get up [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=245.2s)]
*  You know 17 to something and then they do what they do which is score a touchdown or a field goal in the second half [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=251.28s)]
*  They try and run mixing these nuts. You know to 15 times. That's their their path, and you're up against Carson Wentz [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=256.88s)]
*  But I just don't trust that we're gonna see a healthy Mahomes, and I don't [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=264.88s)]
*  Like that since that that Kansas City defense one bit [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=270.8s)]
*  the other thing that worries me about it is [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=274.64s)]
*  Just when the team also then has to play on Wednesday. I just don't know what that that we talked about this a little last week [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=277.96s)]
*  I don't know what that does mentally for like how you have an edge for that game any of that stuff [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=283.28s)]
*  They're planning right there planning for Saturday and Wednesday the Chiefs are doing that right now [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=287.74s)]
*  How can it make sense to have Mahomes in any kind of diminished capacity? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  Saturday game and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=298.08s)]
*  Yet, I don't want to stay away from the other Saturday game because I think we see it the same the Ravens minus six and a [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=300.35999999999996s)]
*  half Steelers [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=306.44s)]
*  I want to there's a lot of like stuff with Lamar and watch out if the Steelers own him and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=306.91999999999996s)]
*  I think without pickings. I just I just don't see the Steelers getting there you would have to be [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=313.76s)]
*  Almost the greatest hits of bad Ravens Steelers games from a Baltimore perspective [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=321.36s)]
*  Missfield goals Lamar doing something dumb [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=327.24s)]
*  the the tipped interception [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=329.76s)]
*  All kinds of stupid shit though 50-yard pass interference that the Steelers get to give them a new drive [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=332.72s)]
*  And as we we stayed with we stayed at the craps table with the Steelers [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=337.76s)]
*  I think one week too long last week. Yeah, they're 10 and 4. I think if they're 10 and 5 that's fine [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=342.0s)]
*  I [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=348.88s)]
*  Don't know problem for them is that they go to [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=350.72s)]
*  Wednesday against the Chiefs right headed five that's hard. Yeah, but they're still a play [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=354.4s)]
*  They're making the playoffs and yes, they are [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  Baltimore lost them already. So now so if you're taking Pittsburgh you're saying we're almost taking there a touchdown underdog on [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=362.76s)]
*  Top of it. They would be beaten Baltimore twice in the same season [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=368.96s)]
*  They'd Baltimore be 9 and 6 after this so they wouldn't you know, they'd be like a 6 or 7 [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=372.76s)]
*  I don't know. I just think the Ravens win and I don't I don't want to lay the points [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=378.68s)]
*  I just want to take their money line and put it with stuff [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=382.8s)]
*  Yeah, because every trend that's out there says that against the spread. This is a [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=385.32s)]
*  Great opportunity to get in on on Pittsburgh. I don't want to have anything to do with Pittsburgh with no TJ [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=392.48s)]
*  What let's see what what like? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=398.3s)]
*  What that's their record without TJ? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=401.0s)]
*  What is abysmal and every number goes out the window if he doesn't play now? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=403.59999999999997s)]
*  It seems like he's gonna play the practice reports, you know kind of have him in the mix [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=407.8s)]
*  But if he's diminished at all, then I don't I don't love it against this Ravens [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=412.28s)]
*  offense and [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=417.79999999999995s)]
*  Like, you know cold that feels like a Derek Henry game the front seven for [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=419.11999999999995s)]
*  Pittsburgh didn't really get home against the Eagles [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=425.2s)]
*  Offensive line. I mean that's the other thing they got they got their asses kicked last week [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=428.55999999999995s)]
*  And that's I I think the Ravens offense is as good as the Eagles offense. Yeah. All right, so [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=433.55999999999995s)]
*  We're marking down Ravens money line Ravens money line, that's the way to play [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=439.92s)]
*  So I have news flash for you I want to do either all money lines or adjusted underdog lines this week and tie them [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=445.56s)]
*  With a couple games, but let's let's hit the games really quick [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=452.68s)]
*  Eagles minus three nap against Washington. This is another one where I think I just like the money line. Yeah, great [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=456.04s)]
*  I just want to grab the Eagles money line and put it with something else. I don't trust the hook [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=461.96000000000004s)]
*  I don't know how I percent trust this Eagles team and [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=465.96000000000004s)]
*  I bet in this situation before as have you where you bet the Eagles and Jalen hurts [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=469.48s)]
*  Just has a super weird game and has some weird injury that they're not sure our heart how much he's hurt and certain in triple coverage [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=473.62s)]
*  It's got the busted finger on the non throwing hand. Yeah, this comes out [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=480.72s)]
*  I got two things other than the Philly being way better than Washington [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=485.78000000000003s)]
*  They have the best running attack in the league [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=489.76s)]
*  Your team is 28th against the run [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=492.36s)]
*  Washington is the third best running attack in the league Philly's number one against the run [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=495.36s)]
*  Your team hasn't looked really that good in six seven weeks [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=499.96000000000004s)]
*  And you've been calling it out week after week talking about like yeah the schedules catching up to these guys a little bit [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=503.44s)]
*  They were overachieving early. It's starting to come back to earth. I [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=509.08000000000004s)]
*  Just don't think they're in the same ballpark as Philly. I don't trust the hook. I don't trust the cheap TD [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=513.04s)]
*  I'd rather do Philly money line and you make you nervous [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=518.64s)]
*  Your instinct is lined up with with my instinct because I've seen enough of these Philly, Washington games even in seasons where there's been dramatic [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=521.92s)]
*  Difference much more pronounced difference in the quality of the team of that Monday night game that yeah [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=529.64s)]
*  Ended the Eagles winning streak that yeah, it was just you know, 2021. I think [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=535.0s)]
*  whatever handful of seasons ago, but [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=540.4399999999999s)]
*  You know the right way to play is to take the team that has the better players [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=543.92s)]
*  I [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=547.52s)]
*  want to [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=548.4s)]
*  Be as reductive as possible that this and that's something to play it. They're playing for a one seed [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=549.36s)]
*  It's like they're like, oh, I don't know. Should we try this week like they were trying to get a bye week [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=555.06s)]
*  I mean again Washington. I'm so happy. I love this team and they did get right they looked awesome against Tennessee [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=559.4s)]
*  They kicked the rest they looked awesome in the first half against the Saints, but they still like that defense [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=566.06s)]
*  It's the thing why when you called me last summer [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=571.52s)]
*  Like [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=574.8s)]
*  Now they've made a run it's really incredible but [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=579.84s)]
*  Filling on the money line is the right way to play this and you're basically in the playoffs [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=583.28s)]
*  You just got to win the Atlanta game or the Dallas game. I agree [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=587.36s)]
*  I was a real two games, although taking Kirk causes his corpse out of there probably [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=590.48s)]
*  You've probably said [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=595.68s)]
*  Yeah, Kyle's gonna have to bleep that [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=601.76s)]
*  Viking Seahawks in Seattle and [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=605.4399999999999s)]
*  This isn't a reactionary Seattle sucked last week [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  So I want to now go against them again because we really try not to do that [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=611.4s)]
*  If anything, that's like the worst thing you can do we try I am a petty better [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=615.36s)]
*  Yeah, me too. And it's Seattle. I'll be honest. Seattle hurt my feelings last week. I was wounded [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=620.72s)]
*  Feelings that came was over. I said I just lost this I just I watched the first seven minutes [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=629.24s)]
*  He's gone. Yeah, you knew it was it started like for one o'clock West Coast time by 1 30 [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=634.0s)]
*  I was like, alright cross that up. Yeah, so I just think this is a horrible matchup for them [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=641.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't like the matchup at all [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=646.0s)]
*  The Minnesota's defense the Minnesota's ability to throw [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=648.08s)]
*  With to either receiver have explosive plays mix the running game in and I asked something Minnesota's good and [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=654.6s)]
*  The line is Vikings by two I [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=661.5999999999999s)]
*  Think this is Vikings are a top five team [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=664.64s)]
*  Seattle's [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=667.92s)]
*  We learned last week is somewhere in the middle and this is just bad luck [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=669.0s)]
*  They played Green Bay and the Vikings back-to-back at home and those games are just really hard [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=673.04s)]
*  And I think the Seahawks are gonna lose [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=677.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, it would be hard enough if Gito wasn't hurt you cannot under any circumstances [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=679.16s)]
*  Counting in so even a five percent chance that Sam how will be playing quarterback for first? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=685.56s)]
*  Yeah, right or because that or like injured Gino doesn't sound great to me either [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=690.68s)]
*  I don't even like hundred percent healthy Gino that much. This is another test of the thesis [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=695.12s)]
*  We just did this with Baltimore and Pittsburgh take the team with a better offense, Minnesota, Seattle [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=699.8s)]
*  I'll take the team with the better offense. I know who it is Minnesota secondary gettable [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=704.4399999999999s)]
*  We've been watching some teams, you know quietly pass the ball on them, especially in second halves. Seattle can't do it [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=709.52s)]
*  We haven't seen Seattle's offense really do anything for feels like six weeks now [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=715.3199999999999s)]
*  Do you know what happened? Yeah Metcalfe got hurt and just hasn't looked the same [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=720.08s)]
*  Yeah lock it I guess is that like a different point of his career. I'm not sure what happened to him [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=725.0s)]
*  Kenneth Walker got hurt. So now it's like just one running back and then you know [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=729.84s)]
*  JSN's been there awesome receiver, but that's only gonna take you so far. All right, so we agree [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=734.48s)]
*  we'll take the Vikings are minus three and [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=739.08s)]
*  I don't care because we're gonna use the money line for them, too. Yeah fine. Great [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=742.64s)]
*  So a pass on the Raiders pass on the Lions I looked at long and hard at Rams jets for the Jets side I [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=747.24s)]
*  Thought when it was three and a half at the Jets have actually been playing like pretty well lately. Yeah [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=755.72s)]
*  I don't trust like the Rams a lot of momentum behind them going west coast to East Coast [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=761.32s)]
*  But I just don't want to bet on the Jets especially with all the dysfunction this week [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=766.48s)]
*  I'm gonna talk about later with Peter Schrager this athletic story that came out and Garrett Wilson today [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=770.48s)]
*  Gives a quote later in the afternoon about do you think you'd be with the Jets last year's like honestly? I don't know like it [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=775.6s)]
*  There's a dysfunction [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=781.52s)]
*  smell from them that I don't like so I feel like that's a stay away, but [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=783.52s)]
*  What's not a stay away for me is another dysfunction II team? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=788.32s)]
*  The 49ers in Miami. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, 49ers plus one and a half [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=792.8000000000001s)]
*  Which one is the dysfunction II team? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=797.76s)]
*  Which one is the dysfunction II team both of them [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=799.84s)]
*  The Niners I feel like probably should be favored in this game as weird as their seasons been [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=804.8s)]
*  Adjusted on Fandol to plus four and a half I [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=812.8s)]
*  Think we can get a little frisky [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=816.48s)]
*  With some people I want to put them with but just fundamentally Niners plus four and a half does that sound appealing to you? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=818.92s)]
*  So what's weird is to me? Why are you going in that direction? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=826.5999999999999s)]
*  I'd rather lay points with the Niners because I think that they're the but I'd like to be it like [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=830.48s)]
*  Do it like Niners minus two and a half like you know [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=834.88s)]
*  Going that direction where they underdog because right now they're underdog in that game. The money line is minus 106 [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=839.0799999999999s)]
*  It's like, you know, I'm not gonna disparage my my great friend my the host of the Sunday [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=846.88s)]
*  Pre-game show rigor Sunday pregame. I'm not gonna say that's a JJ [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=853.16s)]
*  underdog money line play [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=857.6s)]
*  Even though JJ does you know sometimes get close to the line in terms of his dog [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=860.36s)]
*  But minus 106 is even a dog. So let's go if he's gonna get on San Francisco. Let's get on them [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=865.96s)]
*  Let's lay a little points. Let's take it in the direction. We think it's gonna go [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=873.0s)]
*  San Francisco first half game is plus 165 just mentioning that [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=877.52s)]
*  Let's see so minus [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=883.44s)]
*  The odds just aren't great for those it's unfando minus 112 for the minus 2.5 [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=886.8000000000001s)]
*  They don't well they think [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=893.8000000000001s)]
*  Christians gonna get mad, you know, I know we just can't get any value. Yeah. Well, they know that's like a smart move to bend it [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=898.0s)]
*  So they want it they want to keep you so the money line is plus 106 plus 106 [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=904.46s)]
*  So it moved a little bit it moves a tiny bit but not enough to me [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=910.04s)]
*  You're just better off doing the plus 106 [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=914.8s)]
*  Yeah, but I can also offer you plus four and a half at minus 215 that we could put with usik [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=917.16s)]
*  One of the main things I want to put with you. Oh, okay. Yeah [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=923.76s)]
*  That's what I was thinking [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=927.16s)]
*  well, I [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=928.88s)]
*  was gonna do this later, but let's just say that that uh [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=930.68s)]
*  That [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=933.72s)]
*  Niners plus four and a half with usik is plus 141 because usik is like a minus 150 favorite [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=935.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's like minus 145 range. Okay. So alright, well, we'll come back to them. We both like the Niners. I [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=941.8000000000001s)]
*  Really like the Bengals, but I refuse. I'm just not doing it. I just not I don't read it [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=949.08s)]
*  I think great just stay away. Good luck today [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=953.64s)]
*  I know they have a chance to make the playoffs depending what happens with Denver tonight [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=956.12s)]
*  I will tell you I'll confess right away. I you have the Bengals in a tease already [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=959.64s)]
*  I know I have them in money line positions. I they are a leg in as a money line [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=963.88s)]
*  Well, that was my question. Do we do Bengals money line? I just don't trust their defense. Oh, you can't trust it [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=968.72s)]
*  It's it's a T. R. Is the quarterback now right? That's I don't know what that's gonna look like. Oh, I have an idea [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=975.04s)]
*  Suspicion [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=982.36s)]
*  Cards minus four and a half in Carolina. I watched the cards pretty closely against the Pats. They're not very good [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=983.68s)]
*  I don't like the way that's ridiculous bucks cowboy is another stay away with that bucks defense and then the two big ones for me [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=989.52s)]
*  The bills to beat the Patriots and the Packers to beat the Saints on Monday night no Camara rattlers gonna put I [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=999.1999999999999s)]
*  Think I wanted to vote week 16 [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1008.76s)]
*  To just that being in every bet that we have both of them are minus 1100 on fan duel and could we use those teams together? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1011.1999999999999s)]
*  As swing bets with other money lines that we like we haven't done this all year [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1019.92s)]
*  Oh, I mean, I feel like we haven't done it in five years [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1023.96s)]
*  This is like it's an old school old like get the anchor and then you build around the anchor anchor strategy [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1026.68s)]
*  So the old money line parlay welcome back to my life [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1033.8s)]
*  Pats home for the bills land are getting 14 and a half to bundo today and the ringer and his excellent game and column [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1038.2s)]
*  Recommended the Pats plus 14 cold weather blah blah blah. I [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1045.76s)]
*  Just don't see any scenario like Barmore got scratched [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1050.04s)]
*  I don't see any scenario where the Patriots beat the bills like none zero all they've been doing all week stuck by the coach and [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1052.96s)]
*  Then Packers Saints Monday night [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1059.8s)]
*  Packers still playing for stuff [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1063.1599999999999s)]
*  Saints I don't know what they're playing for but they're you know [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1065.9199999999998s)]
*  They you got to watch them firsthand last week did the damn press even anyway [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1068.84s)]
*  No, no, they they got they did a great rope adobe bike by having Washington prepare for [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1073.76s)]
*  Boudoir photo hater, you know the guy who's real attribute as an NFL quarterback are the pictures of himself [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1079.5600000000002s)]
*  Getting him out and putting rather in it messed up the watch the defense [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1087.44s)]
*  One by ten you you had first down in the nine yard line [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1091.88s)]
*  You could have kneeled three times also the game was 60 minutes and four seconds [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1095.64s)]
*  We're gonna give teams extra time to get touchdowns then you're in trouble [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1101.08s)]
*  All right [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1105.96s)]
*  So going back to where we were before bills money line Packers money line is the anchor that we're using the anchor strategy this week [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1106.56s)]
*  Love it put that with the Vikings money line minus 104. Okay, that's a nice even money play put that with the Eagles money line minus 120 [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1112.84s)]
*  fine [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1121.4399999999998s)]
*  You put that with usic [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1122.9199999999998s)]
*  Minus 104. Yep. See we're doing it and we laid out the manic strategy with [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1124.96s)]
*  on Tuesday about Usyk why it just just all in on him [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1132.0s)]
*  We could also use Usyk as an anchor [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1137.3200000000002s)]
*  with the Ravens money line [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1140.68s)]
*  Ravens money line Usyk plus 121 [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1143.4s)]
*  Niners plus four and a half with Usyk plus 141 [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1146.5600000000002s)]

*  We just use anchors of Usyk [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1177.3200000000002s)]

*  But the Chiefs weren't very impressive [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1214.98s)]
*  Their offense really didn't look great and that was with the homes, you know, most of the game healthy and [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1217.22s)]
*  You know and we're gonna stay away from the Bengals money line. I [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1222.46s)]

*  They're gonna make a decision about it. But in any event [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1284.58s)]

*  We have two teams that we like on the money line this week both Buffalo and Green Bay [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1355.04s)]
*  huge money lines minus 1100 each [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1361.84s)]
*  Massive so you don't get a lot of value bit on Fandel you get some value and then you start grabbing [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1364.52s)]
*  You know teams at lesser odds that that you like again just on the money line and try and build up around even money [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1370.6799999999998s)]
*  Or to a plus side and try and and and build up a little bit of bankroll for those last-minute Christmas gifts [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1377.9199999999998s)]
*  Yes, because I'm shopping to do so we're using two anchors [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1383.9599999999998s)]
*  The first one are the Buffalo Bills just to beat New England in New England and the Green Bay Packers [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1387.3999999999999s)]
*  Just to beat the Saints two of the worst teams right now though [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1393.7199999999998s)]
*  The Pats are one of the four worst teams Saints are one of the ten worst teams [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1397.82s)]
*  putting those two money lines together with [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1402.1s)]
*  the Vikings [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1404.74s)]
*  with their money lines, so the Vikings are minus three in Seattle and [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1406.58s)]
*  We're just gonna [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1412.86s)]
*  Something about the minus three we're just gonna take the let's just take the money line on it take the money line Sam [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1414.78s)]
*  Darnold's do the throw a pick. I mean he's been looking out there. Yeah [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1420.3799999999999s)]
*  They might win by one we're just covered just win the game Minnesota, so that's minus 104 no offense to Seattle [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1423.18s)]
*  We still have a bunch of bets with them nice little hedge against our bets to the that's right [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1429.54s)]
*  And then the other one is the Eagles money line [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1433.52s)]
*  Which if you put with the Bills and the Packers the Eagles just to beat Washington their minus three and a point favorites [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1436.02s)]
*  You put those three together minus 120 [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1441.98s)]
*  So we're going to put 200 K down [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1445.98s)]
*  Yes on those two events 200 can each bet [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1449.0600000000002s)]
*  Next one the Ravens money line on Saturday against Pittsburgh [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1453.22s)]
*  This will probably be a weird ugly strange game. We both whether the way it could be freezing cold bad weather [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1458.22s)]
*  It's a Derek Henry game [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1464.8600000000001s)]
*  We don't like the Ravens minus six and a half just the money line. We're putting that with [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1467.14s)]
*  Alexander Usyk [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1471.5800000000002s)]

*  Excellent excellent. We're gonna put [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1478.66s)]
*  200 K on that [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1481.94s)]
*  Niners plus four and a half [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1485.62s)]

*  141 [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1503.46s)]
*  We'll put 150 on that pull on less there fair enough [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1505.18s)]
*  And then Bengals money line with Usyk [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJqdQcLJLgw&t=1509.1399999999999s)]
