# Is Anyone in the NFC Actually Good? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUTjZV21TqE)
*  The NFC might stink. Who's good? You watched football for the last four days. The NFC West
*  might stink. Brady's 45. He lost another offensive lineman today. The Eagles gave up 35 points to
*  Detroit. Your team, I think, stinks. Green Bay's passing game, they could barely move the ball.
*  So we're getting Kirk Cousins in the Super Bowl? How is this going to play out?
*  Well, you're reading into the fact that the Cowboys are in sole position of last place and the Seahawks
*  are solely atop the NFC West. You think that's an issue right now?
*  The 0-0 Seahawks are in first place. They're it. This is it. They're running through the streets
*  like Appalachian State fans. This is really nuts. Yeah, well, we never thought anyone... Look,
*  I'm not going to overreact to the Packers. I'm just not going to do it because then they lose like 36
*  to three or something terrible, 37 to three to the Saints. And then Rogers went on to throw two
*  interceptions the rest of the year. So I'm not going to go too crazy. A lot of teams have offensive
*  line issues, mine included. Tampa Bay seems to have solved theirs. I don't know how, just within
*  an hour. And Green Bay did too. And you could tell Rogers was out of sync with his offensive line,
*  but I think they're going to be fine. But you're right. If there was a line on AFC versus NFC to
*  win the Super Bowl, I would take it at minus 250. Really? So you would say almost AFC is like a
*  minus six favorite. Yeah, I was looking, Vando had kept the Super Bowl odds up during the game,
*  which I was confused by, but Tampa, they had plus 750 to win the Super Bowl. Green Bay 13 to one.
*  The Rams 14 to one. So the Rams would be the third NFC team. The Eagles 16 to one. They gave up 35
*  points to Detroit. San Francisco 22 to one. I have no idea who their quarterbacks could be two weeks
*  from now. Minnesota 24 to one. Your team is 26 to one and the Saints were 32 to one. I'm with you.
*  The one team that I'm not ready to panic with yet are the Packers. Like Watson drops that bomb at
*  the start of the game. Is the game different if that happens? Minnesota played really well. They
*  didn't really have the dumb Kirk Cousins turnover that they get sometimes. And Green Bay was kind
*  of lingering in that game if they didn't have it. And it just seemed to me like some sloppiness
*  and some early season stuff with Rogers and the receivers. But that would be the team I picked.
*  Wasn't that a must win for the Vikings? Wasn't that a kitchen sink game for the Vikings? Like
*  if they lose that, it's like, oh, same old shit. We can't beat this team. They're going to be on top
*  of the division. They're going to win it by three games. So they were good. I mean, obviously
*  Jefferson's going to be a problem. He was wide open on plays I'll never understand for life.
*  How he got so wide open on some of them against the defense. Like getting behind these linebackers,
*  these blue chippers. But 23-7, it's all right. It's not too impressive. I'm not giving up on the
*  Packers just yet. Yeah. I wonder if Jefferson is just going to go down as the best NFC player of
*  this season. I'm not saying he's like as good as Rogers, anything like that, but just impactful
*  week to week. Is he just going to be the dominant guy? Because he was the guy out of every better
*  day that jumped off the TVs. Didn't seem like they could cover him. I felt like if the Vikings
*  didn't have the lead like they did, there was like a 300 yard game potentially in play for him.
*  Didn't you feel that way? Yeah, probably. Yeah, exactly. They did try to run the clock out towards
*  you. Yeah, I don't want to take too much away from them. But again, I'm not, and I had them as a
*  playoff team. I had the Packers winning the division, but we saw what happened to the Saints.
*  I'm not going to count Rogers out. And I do think, obviously Mahomes had an immediate,
*  immediately made the naysayers look stupid with his number 10 Pacheco against Tyree Kill. Now we're
*  saying which number 10 is better? He's made his receivers adjust. I think the same thing is going
*  to happen with Rogers within the next couple of weeks. Well, the Bucs fans are listening going,
*  wait a second. We just had a dominant Sunday night game. Why aren't we in the mix?
*  There's no Bucs fans. We have Bucs fans listening. Maybe. There might be a couple out there.
*  Their defense was really good tonight. I just don't know. Now we can kind of ease into your
*  team a tiny bit. Great. I don't know if it was your defense being, your offense being confident,
*  Tampa's defense being good or both. What was your take watching?
*  It sucked. And you know, I did the Spotify live. Thank you for hooking that up. Now it's me and
*  the degenerate trifecta doing Spotify live in the fourth quarter of every cowboy game. And I'm like,
*  okay, now people can taunt us and but it'll be close. It'll be a fun game. And I actually did
*  think the Cowboys are going to win. I don't know the hour we were on. I don't know if we had the
*  first down. By the way, our quarterback's out. He has a broken thumb. He's getting surgery on his
*  thumb. So now it's now we're looking at Cooper Rush. That's the news. That's it. Yeah. He came
*  to the sideline. He said it was broken. That's what I'm saying. We buried the lead. I didn't
*  realize he broke his thumb. I told you yours got a broken back, mine's thumb. And when he took it
*  out of his ass, he saw that it was broken. Like, I don't know what, I don't know what to do now.
*  We didn't even really carry a second quarterback until Cooper Rush was a rush emergency backup.
*  And it was awful. They won 19-3. I would say, like, I don't know if you would have told me this
*  morning that the Buccaneers were going to score one touchdown. I would have like, how much? Let
*  me put my house on it. I'll take everything on the Cowboys. I love them this game. And they shit the
*  bed. And, you know, I can't even blame McCarthy. Well, I want to blame McCarthy. That's all I want
*  to do. I want to get to that point. It doesn't look like I'm going to get there. Yeah. Because
*  a couple of times your defense stopped them on situations where it looked like the game was about
*  to get blown open in the second quarter, where it seemed like the Bucs were going to end the quarter
*  with like 20 plus points and they didn't. Here's what I didn't realize I was going to miss so much.
*  And it got me four Lauren to when McCarthy gets fired, which could be three weeks from now,
*  is the him staring at the jumbotron, trying to figure out what the penalty was.
*  With that look on his face, which I think will be with the clapper for Jason Garrett. I don't know
*  what the nickname is for that. Right. Jumbotron watcher. Like I don't even know what you would
*  call him. The ogler, the stare. Yeah. I don't know what he would be. The mouth breather.
*  So I didn't like CD Lamb in any of our fantasy leagues. We're in two of them together because
*  I was really worried about him being the only weapon versus the situation he was in last year,
*  which was pretty ideal. And the receivers, you were trying to out of it. Riding me a little bit
*  of the Rams game, except he's a lesser Cooper cup where he's throwing at people and Collins worth
*  got mad at one point that that out pass to that DAC through to number 17. I don't even know that
*  guy's name is and Collins worth, he could barely talk. Yeah. I don't even know. And he was like,
*  you've got to complete that pass. You've got, you just, and I don't know if he was mad at DAC
*  or the receiver, but it was really awful. They, you just look super sloppy. My God. You know,
*  first of all, I'm taking up smoking and since I switched from parliaments to Marlboro Alliance,
*  it's just an old different way. I sound like, I sound like curly on a city slickers right now.
*  So let's just get the herd back to the ranch and that boy that Dalton Schultz or something else
*  is Al. Oh no, you're not Al. I'm a 10 pounds of mucinex.
*  Who are you? I'm a chain smoker now, so get used to it. That'll happen there.
