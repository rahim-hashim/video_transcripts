# What Team Will Tom Brady Play for Next? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [January 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0v-gwoj_OM)
*  We all have to pick a team
*  We think Tom Brady is going to play for next year and I'll take the third pick
*  Which is good. We go snake draft nor you go first
*  We think he's going to or think he should
*  No, think he's going to what team will be he be on in 2023 because I think all of us think he's gonna play again
*  I think most likely is the Raiders
*  I
*  Give my thoughts after Stephen you go second. That was my pick but uh, I'll do a different pick
*  You know what? I'll go San Francisco. I don't care. I don't care about Brock Purdy
*  Francisco
*  There's four teams and San Francisco's one of them I might as well go bold she took my my first pick man
*  That was really bold Brock Purdy hasn't lost yet. He's seven and oh
*  Give it time his time will come he's gonna be getting all the other what what was Baker Mayfield doing commercials for?
*  Progressive. Yeah, he's gonna be getting the progressive insurance where like in October next year
*  We're like, can you believe Brock Purdy has three commercials?
*  I don't even know a whole like Bay Area housing market thing with that. That's good. Be good. All right my pick
*  So you so you have to pick Steven basically took two picks get you what's your backup pick Nora?
*  My backup pick
*  Would be the Dolphins. Mm-hmm. Okay, so the Dolphins are my main pick
*  My backup pick is Carolina
*  okay, and I'm I'm gonna just
*  put Houston out there as like just
*  just kind of putting them over there just in case Sean Payton goes there and
*  Who knows
*  They I think they have a ton of picks they could trade one of them for for Payton and
*  It does feel like Payton and Brady might be a package deal
*  But if he actually wants to win the title and go with Sean Payton, it's not New Orleans because I knew Orleans
*  You know, it's been well documented with their situation is cap wise. I
*  Thought Carolina was good and ironically what are the odds?
*  We have a Carolina Panthers fan on this podcast
*  Like you have to admit they have talent
*  It's not inconceivable that if they got Brady and they did two other things in the NFC
*  That's like a top three seed. What do you think of that one? Steven?
*  I mean I would be I would be down for it as a Panthers fan. I they have the offensive line
*  They have some yeah good receivers. The defense is young. I mean I could see it if they get the right coach
*  I don't know if they're gonna get the right coach
*  but and I also think like David Tepper is the kind of owner that Brady could kind of like
*  Have some power some real power in that organization
*  So I could see like that he ceded power to Matt rule of all people so Brady walks in there
*  He's given the keys to the franchise. I
*  think Miami is most realistic because I
*  Still I'm sorry, but I just find it hard to believe two is gonna play football again after he had three
*  Concussions in the span of two months maybe
*  I'm gonna say right now like how many concussions is enough before we all go?
*  Whoa, that was too many is it do we need to get to four do we need to get to six and everyone's saying that first?
*  Concussion well, no, that wasn't technically a concussion. It's like, okay cool. Well, he
*  wobbled and and
*  Had to take a knee and that fit the profile of any concussion
*  I've ever watched a football game and then he got another one three days later four days later
*  So I'm gonna say that first one was probably concussion. But like what is he gonna have?
*  What if he has another next year? Like how do you even?
*  my guess would be that maybe he takes a year off and
*  Maybe Brady comes in as the stopgap for a year, but nor is their line good enough. Does that fit the profile for him?
*  I mean
*  That's more of we know the relationship with the owner and we know that they tried to do it once
*  So maybe they would try to do it again and you like the offensive weapons the line is the question
*  I mean
*  Carolina offensive line in much better shape than Miami and then I think the other thing that you have to think about is that if
*  I could pick I would much rather be in the NFC as
*  Tom Brady at this point than in the AFC where you have to deal with all of those quarterbacks
*  but
*  Miami
*  lifestyle
*  He's already in Florida kids are there already to yeah, the kids are there
*  There's there's there's definitely a lot to that and then I I
*  think they're gonna need a quarterback and
*  for everything that they've done to
*  Put that roster in a Super Bowl window outside of the quarterback position. I don't think that Ross and and
*  Everybody there is just gonna say oh, well, whoops this this thing happened with to us. So
*  shoot now
*  We have Tyreek and and
*  We made that move and we spent all this money, but guess it's over like they're gonna try to do something
*  Everything that we know about how they behave says that they're gonna try to do something and says that they've the last time they tried
*  To do that. It was with Tom Brady. So that makes a lot of sense to me
*  The other one that I would throw out there is the Jets
*  Garrett Wilson, I test drove that you are about a week and a half ago and everybody went bonkers
*  They'd have to get rid of their coach and hire Sean Payton I think would have to be part of it
*  Yeah, it's him. Just going to the Jets on his own seems weird to me. I
*  Steven I don't think Vegas happens that can I can I explain my Vegas pick? I don't think he's yeah
*  Let's go. I don't think he should go to Vegas, but I think he
*  He would talk himself into Vegas and talk himself into being able to win in Vegas because of Josh McDaniel's they have Devante
*  The offensive line isn't good, but they have they had a running game. They have some weapons and
*  I think Tom Brady is someone who I think he's self-aware
*  but I don't think he realizes his limits and what he could bring to a team and I think I
*  Don't know. He's overconfident. Look at his business venture. It's like 80 for Brady. No one know what that's like a heat check
*  No one else does that. I think Brady will could talk himself into winning in Vegas. Sally feels gonna carry that movie. I
*  Think it's too far away from the fam. I
*  don't think yeah McDaniel's are nearly as close as people seem to think they are and
*  I don't think that's a team that is
*  Able to just they're two moves away that team needs a lot of work. They're not yeah
*  They need to figure out can they trade car for anything? They need to figure out the defense
*  Nor you wrote about some of this stuff
*  When was that today?
*  Did you write about yeah, you had someone like I don't know. I just don't feel like
*  You're in a division with me. Yeah, that's in her part part. So
*  Carolina seems tiny to me like it's even even tinier market than Tampa, but at the same time it's on the it's in the south
*  it's in the NFC same division, he knows all the teams and
*  Goddamn, I thought the Panthers were pretty good. I know I like basically sunk with the ship
*  I did hit my six and a half over but I felt like that team
*  Easily could have won ten games. I can name three games. They should have won right now off the top of my head
*  And I thought they had talent and even like if what happens if horn doesn't get hurt
*  For that Tampa game like they probably win the division and they would have done better against Dallas than Tampa did I think
*  Yeah, not about that was bad coaching losing that Tampa game was like totally on Wilkes and I agree with you
*  I think the only reason that you ended up sinking is because they didn't have a quarterback and when you have a
*  Limited quarterback can only do a certain amount of things
*  There's an expiration date on it and we saw that happen in Carolina that offense fell off a cliff after that Lions game
*  Well, they've become the early buzz team is like if I were a coaching candidate
*  Carolina may be at the top of the list, which I don't know that I saw coming but it does make sense
*  There's a lot of good young players. You've got an owner who will pay if he needs to
*  So if you're Sean Payton and if Brady feels like that as a package deal would be his dream situation. I
*  Like the owner I think I like what I've read about him
*  And I think all these owners come in and they fail in the first couple years
*  They think they know what they're doing and they don't and they have to learn the hard way
*  But I think he'll spend the money, you know, which if you're in Carolina, that's probably the only thing you want
*  like I said on Sunday, I told Sal that I was
*  pretty sure they weren't gonna fire Brandon Staley the Chargers because I think they're too cheap and
*  So what happened on Monday? They fired the OC they hired they fired the QB coach
*  Brandon Staley's coming back. They don't want to pay two coaches
*  At least Carolina has shown that guy will spend the money that guy's like spend all that money on Matt Rose
*  Like all right, go ahead leave and I'll just pay for another coach. So
