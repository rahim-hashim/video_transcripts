# The Denver Broncos Are a Total Mess | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgq2wJEgYrM)
*  These were mistakes that were horrifying to watch in real time.
*  Like a team that didn't seem like they had a coach, like very basic.
*  What are we going to do decisions that he just seemed woefully unprepared for
*  has been laid out in that piece to the point that they're also on my do not
*  bet list.
*  I, I, you're going to have to show me for multiple weeks that there's more
*  cohesion.
*  What is going on?
*  Why is this guy so seemingly over his head?
*  I've, I've known Lindsay Jones from the ringer for 20 years now.
*  And Lindsay, anytime there's anything Denver related, like I immediately like
*  go to her timeline.
*  And I heard her and Kevin Clark speaking earlier this week on, on Kev's podcast.
*  And what she was saying was spot on in that there was no sarcasm.
*  There was no irony.
*  It was like they were helping out Russell Wilson yelling the play clock down
*  from five.
*  I've never seen this.
*  The fans.
*  Yeah.
*  I've never seen this.
*  It's never happened.
*  It wasn't sarcasm.
*  It wasn't, it was like genuinely trying to help Russell Wilson with the play
*  clock because it was so confounding.
*  And then they're kicking a, you know, a 64 yarder in Seattle, but then
*  McManus and then McManus is money.
*  And then they get the delay game.
*  And from 59, it's like, we can't hit, we can't dare, you know, altitude
*  in Denver where that's where they're supposed to kick it.
*  So the decisions are so confounding.
*  And a lot of it, what about the goal, the goal to go stuff in the first
*  half when he had like a minute and a half left on the clock and somehow
*  they're scrambling and panicking.
*  It's like no college teams can do this.
*  What are you guys doing?
*  And you saw Russell get frustrated for like one moment, but he's such a
*  consummate, like he's such a brand and such a consummate professional that
*  like the next time, and I think you and Sal actually mentioned it, like when
*  they did score, he was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, coach.
*  Yeah, we did it.
*  Hackett's brilliant.
*  And I know I say that and that's going to be a big thing for the fans.
*  I know I say that and that's going to be like, you know, a quote, like
*  Schrager says Hackett's brilliant.
*  He's brilliant with the X's and O's and getting all that stuff going.
*  I don't have any track record of Nathaniel Hackett as a game manager.
*  And that's what head coaching is.
*  A lot of this stuff is delegation and game management first.
*  And they hire your team, setting a tone, the stuff day balls doing.
*  Yes.
*  They hired a guy who I spoke to Hackett at the combine and I'm like, all
*  right, first year defensive coordinator.
*  You're a first year head coach.
*  First year guys, all of the staff.
*  I'm like, do you have that veteran guy?
*  And he's like, I feel pretty comfortable with who we've got.
*  And I brought in a guy who is analytics slash game management that I think I
*  can really trust for those moments.
*  I don't have that guy's name handy.
*  That guy needs to step his shit up too.
*  That guy died four weeks ago.
*  He's he's he's underground.
*  The one thing I learned, I guess, and I didn't really, I stayed away from
*  Denver for the first two weeks anyway.
*  I wasn't nuts about them.
*  But, um, when there's too much new in football, so there are two things that
*  I noticed that I'm filing away for next year, too much new, and then the QB
*  that's not there in the preseason, like with burrow when burrow had the appendix
*  thing interesting and it's, I mean, the Bengals, we could talk about them quickly.
*  I'm not going to overreact to them yet because they're offensive line, which I
*  don't think is as bad as it looked those first two weeks, don't we have to factor
*  in the TJ watt, my Parsons combo?
*  Yes.
*  There's nobody else.
*  No other team in the league has those two guys.
*  They've already checked out the two best pass rushes in the league.
*  Yes.
*  Right.
*  And, and a lot of that stuff is not the offensive line.
*  It's burrow not throwing the ball.
*  And he's a little rusty.
*  So yeah.
*  So I filed that away of like, all right, this was bad.
*  This was a chain of events.
*  We can explain this maybe for week three.
*  Like I'm willing to give them one more chance.
*  I don't know if I'm a better on this week.
*  Denver, they were going to, I need a month.
*  I need a month of confidence.
*  I need to know, you know, what to do with these different game.
*  This is the stuff Belichick is the best at.
*  I know.
*  Like say what you want about him with the draft with like weird offensive plays,
*  but game management, like the last three minutes of the first half, knowing what
*  five minutes of the second half, um, that goal to go stuff, the last two minutes
*  of a game, that's what the Pats were always brilliant at and hack.
*  It's the opposite.
*  So a lot of that, a lot of that stuff will come with experience, but that's not
*  an excuse in the NFL where McVeigh and Belichick and Tomlin are these guys that
*  have been around and they know how to manage that stuff.
*  Like, you know, Brandon Staley last year was the guy where it was like, is there
*  someone helping him on some of these decisions where we praised it the first
*  half of the season and the second half of the season, it was like, okay, you just
*  don't go for it every time on fourth down.
*  There needs to be some sort of guidance or a binder.
*  The Ravens historically spend the most money on an analytics staff.
*  And for a while there, Lamar was getting a lot of success on fourth and short.
*  And a lot of it was John Harbaugh trusting his guys.
*  I'm not sure every team has that.
*  I do know Denver has invested a bunch into analytics.
*  The problem is you need the coach to listen to those analytics guys, and you
*  need to be able to know the communication in that moment without even having a
*  second to, you know, what are we doing?
*  No conversation.
*  I trust you.
*  Here's the, here's the play.
*  Let's go.
*  I think that's going to happen over time, but the fact is this bill, they're one
*  in one, the charges are one in one.
*  The Raiders are Owen too.
*  The Ravens already banged up.
*  You go through the AFC, the bangles are Owen too.
*  There's going to be one AFC South playoff team, you know, maybe two in
*  the East, it's still open.
*  It's still wide open.
*  And I look at them this weekend against San Francisco.
*  Everyone's right.
*  It's a tough place to win.
*  Their defense has played well.
*  You say you're not betting on it, but like Russell Wilson, still Russell
*  Wilson, and I feel like they've got ways away to go to be where they want to be.
*  And they're still just one in one.
*  They're not Owen too.
*  When you say Russell Wilson is still Russell Wilson, you mean like, I
*  believe so.
*  I think he looks all right.
*  I think he looks all right.
*  Physically, he's still the same human being he was two years ago.
*  Cause I don't feel like he's the same quarterback.
*  I think he still looks okay.
*  Like I, I thought he was good.
*  Okay.
*  They traded all this shit for him.
*  It gave him a huge contract.
*  Okay.
*  It's not good enough.
*  I know.
*  Meet those Kyler Murray moments.
*  All right.
*  More panic meter.
*  The Wilson trade.
*  I'm at an eight.
*  I'm at an eight with panic meter for the, if I'm a Broncos fan.
*  This seems to happen.
*  This happened a few times with the Red Sox where, when, especially when I was
*  younger, where it was like, we got Jack Clark.
*  Oh my God.
*  He's a member him in the 87 playoffs and oh Jesus, finally he's going to own the
*  monster and he shows up and it's just not the same guy.
*  And within a year, you're like, Oh my God, this guy's luggage.
*  Andre Dawson.
*  I don't know if Wilson's like that, but it does feel like he's hitting a
*  different phase of his career.
*  He could change that on Sunday by just running around and creating time.
*  Key with him was always creating the extra two, three seconds.
*  I just don't see it from him anymore.
*  It's been a struggle.
*  I get that, but I still think he's got it in him and that's going to take time.
*  That's the same thing I'm saying about Hackett.
*  Like give them a little bit of time.
*  This is week two and he was with them this summer and like, they're all,
*  they're all in on them.
*  I think there's also another narrative going on that's parallel to this, that
*  there's a lot of people, ex players from the Seahawks now coming out, whether
*  they're taking shots or not.
*  Not great.
*  Jay, right.
*  You know, people making like roll in there.
*  A lot of those defensive guys from the Legion of boom era believe that they're
*  the reason that team did what they did.
*  And for some reason, Russell Wilson gets all the credit for it.
*  There is resentment there.
*  And I feel like that's out there.
*  I also think he's low hanging fruit.
*  He's not the coolest guy.
*  He wore a shiny, he wore a shiny suit after a loss to the press conference
*  with like people cringe at Russell Wilson.
*  They think he's corny.
*  They think he's dorky.
*  They think he's, that's all low hanging fruit.
*  I also think he's really good at quarterback.
*  And I think his players that are on his Broncos team are buying in.
*  And I think his coaches attached his lot to him.
*  And I don't think that the Broncos are going to be one of these four and 13
*  teams this year, I think they're going to be okay.
*  And I actually think they might beat the Niners this weekend.
*  I'm going to give you some quarterbacks and you tell me you have who you have
*  ahead of him right now for this year to try to win a Superbowl.
*  Mahomes Rogers.
*  No, no.
*  Josh Allen.
*  No way.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  Herbert and Burrow.
*  No.
*  All right.
*  That's five.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't think he's top five.
*  Tom Brady.
*  I'm not betting again.
*  I'd put Brady over Wilson right now.
*  Yeah, me too.
*  That's six Lamar.
*  Yeah.
*  I'd put Lamar over, over Russell.
*  I put him right.
*  I'd put them right there at eight.
*  Kyler.
*  I would take Russell over Kyler right now.
*  You would for this season.
*  That's a good argument.
*  Stafford, because he's banged up, I wouldn't have him.
*  Cousins, Dak, those guys.
*  Yeah.
*  Car, the way car just, it was an argument, but cars looked like crap for two weeks.
*  The only other one I, what about our, our new hero, Tua?
*  Jalen Hurts.
*  Oh, Tua.
*  I was going to say Hurts and Tua are both right in that.
*  Hurts.
*  I think I would rather have Jalen Hurts than Wilson.
*  So there's nine.
*  There's nine.
*  And I don't even know if I'd want to bet on Jalen Hurts in a playoff game, but what he
*  did against Minnesota, I don't think Wilson will do that anymore.
*  And then my 10th one would be, uh, I can't believe I'm saying this and this is a huge
*  gamble.
*  I really like what I'm seeing from Trevor Lawrence.
*  I saw you.
*  I knew you were going there.
*  I knew you were going there.
*  I just, I just love Trevor Lawrence.
*  I just, I just love that guy.
