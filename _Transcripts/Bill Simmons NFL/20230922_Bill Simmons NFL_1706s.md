# The Way-Too-Early 2023 NFL Redraft With Danny Kelly | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NLMuf2FiWM)
*  All right. Danny Kelly is here. We have a really fun gimmick coming up in a second, but right before we started taping, uh,
*  digs goes out for the year for the cowboys
*  Does what does this do in your in your mind for top teams in the league?
*  Oh, man, that's a good question. I mean it clearly because their defense just was so dominant
*  He's such a good player at creating turnovers. Um
*  Definitely hurts them. I still think they're still up there with among the best teams though
*  yeah, it's just their defense seemed like
*  Was the best unit of anyone's unit in either conference and I wonder how much that compromises it but um,
*  Too bad though poor cowboys fans. Can't they have nice things?
*  Can we figure out a way to make acls indestructible? I feel like science should be caught up with this by now
*  We should at least ban them from practice acl at tears
*  It could only like happen during game and practice is not allowed. Anyway, sorry to the cowboy fans out there
*  All right. We are doing a gimmick. This is the earliest anyone has ever tried this gimmick during a season
*  We're not even in week three yet, but I asked you to do a redraft
*  Of the top 15 picks of the 2023 draft and the reason I asked you
*  Is because this was a goofy draft to begin with you do our draft guide for us
*  You're one of the hosts on our draft show
*  We knew this was going to be a weird draft
*  But now as I watch the rookies unfold and who's jumping out at me on tvs
*  It struck me like I have no idea what the order would be you have baby rhino fell to the eagles at nine
*  He would clearly be higher. Yeah, I think strad would go over bryce
*  I think christian gonzalez would go way higher you could even argue the running backs everybody was much maligned at eight and 12
*  Those might be higher. So i'm just unleashing and what we're gonna do is
*  I'm gonna say who made the pick in april
*  And what they did and then you're gonna say what you think they would do if they could ever redo right now heading into week three
*  So the first pick
*  Is carolina panthers who took bryce young they traded into this pick
*  There was a lot of bryce young stroud
*  Who's it going to be and then they settled on bryce young? Yeah, what do you think the panthers would do if they could redo this?
*  That's a great question. So i'm i put cj stroud
*  I think at the end of the day if we're being totally realistic teams are pretty stubborn and like to stick to their takes
*  So maybe they take bryce again, but if I were them I would take cj stroud
*  I mean what we've seen from him through a couple weeks is really really encouraging
*  He was my number one quarterback anyway, so this makes a lot of sense for me. Just go with shroud
*  He's looked like to me. The big thing is like it doesn't look too big for him
*  It doesn't look too fast for him so far
*  The texans have not been on my tvs a bunch these first two weeks
*  But uh, i've been couldn't help but notice all this cj stroud praise who
*  Who i'm gonna check them out a little more carefully this week because I like that jacksonville spot
*  They're getting a lot of points and I think that's gonna be interesting game. What qb does he remind you of?
*  Um, that's a good question. I think dac comes to mind just kind of like a
*  He's poised he's accurate. He's like a ball distributor
*  I mean, he's got actually his receivers have been a lot better than I thought like nico collins looks like he could be a future star
*  You know robert woods is in there kind of just doing his thing
*  Um and tank dell the rookie the like 150 some i like that rookie. Yeah, he looks really exciting
*  So they've got some guys there
*  Um, and I think just mostly shroud to me again. It doesn't really feel like the game is too fast for him
*  He's doing a few things out of structure, but they've asked him to throw a lot
*  I think he's second in the nfl in in pass attempts right now
*  Um, and I thought he's acquitted himself really well. He looks like he to me is going to be a longtime starter
*  Dell was getting some uh fantasy waiver where our action in all of my lenses. So yeah people were jumping on that one
*  Okay, houston's second
*  He just took cj stroud from them. They're devastated. Yeah, what do they do if they if they had that second pick?
*  I mean you think they just take bryce and like screw it. No, I put richardson anthony richardson
*  Even though I I kind of hate it for anthony richardson
*  I wanted to keep anthony richardson on the colts because I think their coaching staff is really just perfect for him
*  And their system and their scheme and everything
*  But I mean if we're being honest what we've seen from richardson over a couple weeks is again very very encouraging
*  This game doesn't look too fast for him. You know, he's obviously going to be really dangerous with what he can do with his legs
*  Um, and you know, he's the way that he gets the ball out. He avoids sacks
*  I think all of this is super encouraging
*  He he does not look to me like a guy that was you know
*  Basically touted as super raw and super inexperienced like he doesn't look to me like that type of guy
*  I think you know, the future is really bright for this guy. Um, you know if he can stay healthy, of course
*  there's a physicality slash um
*  air to him that I like yeah hard to explain I don't even know what the word is but
*  uh, veren's been a little anthony edwards in basketball where he just
*  Has this looked physically like i'm ready to run over whoever I need to run over
*  Yeah, that's why it was such a bummer when he got concussed in week two because that was a possible breakout game for him
*  I think that was a freak thing. I'm hoping that was a freak thing
*  It wasn't necessarily an indication of you know, how he plays or whatever. Yeah
*  But yeah, it's definitely concerning don't want to see him getting hurt so quickly all a couple of these rookie quarterbacks already hurt. So
*  Yeah, but
*  Yeah, I mean he was the most athletic quarterback of all time literally at the combine
*  Yeah, he's fine. We're seeing there. Yeah, their o-line was a little banged up this week
*  So, um, maybe this is a good game for him to skip if min shu ends up playing
*  Yeah, houston's also on the board with the third pick. They took
*  Will anderson who I think people have
*  Have have liked I think he's been uh, he's been a thumbs up
*  But do you think he would go third if we did a redraft? I do I put I put will anderson here
*  I know that's not like the most exciting thing ever, but I think they obviously were very convicted convicted on him
*  They obviously, you know moved up really far to get him big trade. Yeah, they gave up a future first for that
*  So, you know, I gave him a 12 a future first and then one other was like a second or third, but it was a lot
*  Yeah, so I think they they would stick with this pick. I mean, he's a he's been really good
*  He's been really disruptive getting a lot of pressure. He just looks the part
*  He looked, you know, he passes the i-test. So I think they would stick with that one
*  You liked him in the draft guide, right? I remember you
*  Because he was a pretty he turned into a pretty polarizing guy like yeah, who is this?
*  What is he going to be? I think there was some worry that
*  He was a little light, you know, like not like it not on the same level as some of the the
*  you know top tier passers of the past he's not quite as big as like a
*  You know some of the guys we've seen like a boser whoever. Yeah, and
*  But I think his explosiveness and just overall skill set he's good against a run
*  He can you know get after the passer?
*  I think the way that the texans have been utilizing him so far at least from what i've seen is pretty exciting
*  Kind of letting him go out and you know pin his ears back a little bit. And so
*  Yeah, he's looked really good so far. The texans are definitely a little bit better than I expected team. Yeah, right
*  Yeah, the bears are exactly as bad as I thought they might be seen but the texans are yeah a little friskier
*  They'll they'll at some point and i'm not sure when over the next five weeks ruin a three team parlay or tease
*  They're just going to demolish it. Nobody's going to see it coming. All right, here's where it gets interesting
*  Yep, you just take anthony richardson from
*  And I think I agree with your top three by the way
*  Okay, unless you wanted to throw baby rhino in there for uh for houston
*  But all right, so indy on the clock they took richardson which turned out great for them so far
*  Yeah, now he's off the board in this redraft. Who would you have there? I think so. This is going to be controversial. I'm sure but
*  For the content bjorn robinson
*  So obviously they've ruined their relationship with jonathan taylor that that ship seems to have sailed
*  I don't think that they're going to
*  It doesn't feel like they're going to rekindle that at least you know to the point where they're going to resign him
*  um
*  I don't know man for what i've seen for bjorn robinson
*  He looks to me like he's the best running back in the nfl
*  He looks like and by the way the way they're using him as a receiver
*  They're splitting him out running him all over the field
*  This is like he is actually doing the things we always talk about running backs doing but then it never happens
*  Like bjorn robinson is actually like a positionless player. He's like debo samuel, but like more explosive and so
*  um
*  You know, obviously that's me rationalizing taking him so high but just the way that just how explosive he is if they don't have
*  Uh anthony richardson or cj shroud there. I don't think
*  Chris ballard is going to take a guy like bryce
*  So yeah, well just from what we've seen from bryce too. It's a little little worrisome little shaky so far
*  There's a is he too small question that I think could be legitimately asked. I couldn't agree
*  Moral hardly on bjorn and I know it's just idiotic to take a running back that high but
*  He he leaps off the tv. I don't I don't know if he's the best running back in the league
*  He might be but he's certainly the most exciting. I mean, it just feels like any screen pass any handoff any sweep
*  You're surprised when he gets tackled
*  He seems
*  Like what it's like to watch an awesome college football running back
*  But he's doing that at the nfl level and I I think packers are good like
*  He kind of tore him up a little bit and um, they're clearly their only concern is they don't want to give him too many touches
*  Too many carries they don't want to put too much of a workload on him
*  So he's always around like what 12 to 15 carries maybe a couple screens
*  I'm with you. I I think if you're gonna say who's the most talented running back in the league
*  He would be the first pick right who else would you even put against him? I mean
*  Chubb but that right obviously changes things now and so I don't know. I mean
*  Um, and check doesn't didn't catch the ball like
*  He's not a pass receiver threat. I don't like bijan is I mean
*  As you said bijan can turn into debos samuel out of nowhere
*  I think the only guy that really at this point compares to him is christian mcaffrey, but they're not even like really
*  Stylistically that similar. I don't know. It's like christian mcaffrey is a little smaller and he's more versatile as a receiver bijan is just
*  he's like 220 pounds and
*  Uh, you know raw power and the way that he moves is so unique
*  I feel like you can see that on the first run he had in the NFL where he just cuts
*  He just cuts on a dime
*  I've been kind of comparing him to like the top gun line where he's like I just hit the brakes and let him fly
*  By but he does it so like subtly you see you see defenders run past him like three or four times on one play
*  You know what I mean? And so he's just he's just incredible
*  So i'm really excited about that. Of course the colts could have taken jalen carter here, but I did it for the content
*  You know, I did it for the whole jonathan taylor storyline, too. I love it and I completely support it
*  All right. So you got your beloved seattle seahawks or we're on the clock of five here. They took
*  witherspoon the cornerback
*  In the first iteration who do they take in your opinion now? This is already a discussion in seattle. It's already heating up
*  It's already heating up. Is it on the text threads? It's already on the text threads
*  I think most people are still pretty bullish on devin witherspoon
*  I think he's looked he looked good in the first game they played this last week
*  But i'm going with jalen carter here simply because he's been
*  Like one of the best interior defenders in the nfl period not even among rookies like one of the best interior defenders in the nfl
*  He looks unstoppable
*  so
*  Obviously, I think the the reason the seahawks didn't take him was not necessarily related to football at all
*  You know, i'm guessing they probably had a really high grade on him from a football point of view, but they you know internally
*  What i've heard is that you know, there's one of guys who were really really hardcore competitors
*  And and that was kind of some of the question marks that you had about jalen carter coming in and he landed on team
*  That has a really good support system some of his former teammates there
*  So hopefully it works out for him there
*  But I think just on the football field man
*  He would be really very helpful for what the seahawks are trying to do because their defensive line has not been you know
*  outstanding so far
*  Well with the legal issues he had
*  Five was aggressive nine was like, all right, this is ridiculous. You gotta take them
*  So it's somewhere between five and nine. I think five they would have taken some heat for a couple minutes
*  And then by what june all the seahawks fans were like, holy shit. We got jayley carter
*  right
*  He the thing that's crazy about him
*  He's old school in the sense that because the pats went up against him week one and then I watched week two with minnesota
*  Obviously, but he just he takes up space
*  He's one of those guys that a big body. It's just like putting a building in the middle of the
*  Middle of the game and then just things move the offensive line just kind of moves backward and he's involved
*  So you almost can't even see half the stuff he's doing. It's just a brute force thing
*  Yeah, I think the fact that they got him at nine is just an outrage. It's really is upsetting
*  It's upsetting like i wish arizona had taken him. Why did someone else take him? Yeah, yeah, like arizona
*  He's sitting there arizona's here at number six. They took paris johnson. The uh, it was
*  Considered to be the best tackle in the draft
*  What do you think they do if they have a do over there?
*  I mean, I think they would still be happy with johnson, but I put I put christian gonzalez here
*  I think oh, are we doing this now? Yeah, let's do it. I mean he was do it
*  He was my number seven player coming into the draft
*  And I feel pretty confident that I was on the right side of that story in terms of just like how we've what we've seen
*  From him so far, you know, he looks like, you know, physically athletically
*  Uh, you know schematically he's so versatile so fast so explosive so big so long
*  He has everything you want from a corner
*  I don't I still truly don't really understand how he fell to the patriots where he fell
*  So, I don't know man
*  He to me he looks like a difference maker a guy that can really change your your defense
*  And when we've seen things from like sas gardener what he did what he's done for the jet's defense
*  Like I don't know why he wouldn't go higher
*  It's been one of the great gifts of my last couple years
*  I mean i'm still recovering from the muki bets trade. It's gonna take forever
*  So it's just little victories that are trying to make me feel better. But gonzalez going to 17. I mean he was
*  He took on ty reek a few times
*  especially in the second half and that sunday night game and
*  stayed in the vicinity of him and got a big interception and um
*  He's one of those like you kind of know it right away. You had it with russell wilson ironically in like, uh,
*  2012 where you start hearing the buzz and like late june july
*  The stuff starts coming in the other players start talking about him and he and he's had all those check marks to me
*  He reminds me of uh of rod woodson
*  When rod woodson was a cornerback in the early rod woodson days like just like just a ridiculous athlete
*  He's always in the right spots. He's really competitive and
*  um
*  If you had to rank like who is the best type of player to have on a rookie contract quarterback would be number one
*  Would you go left tackle or a cornerback shut down cornerback?
*  Number two for what the price is compared to what the price is going to be when they're a free agent
*  That's a great question. Um, I guess probably tackle but by a hair
*  Yeah, it kind of depends tackle is just hard because he protects your quarterback. That's like the number one thing, right?
*  Um, but I think corner like I said, it can kind of change the whole complexion of your defense
*  I mean look at you know, sas gardener he he can shut down the entire side of a field
*  You know that that like really limits what the other team can do
*  And so I think obviously these are big impact players they get paid like it and like you said
*  Like getting a guy on a rookie contract that can completely take take out like a number one receiver or shut down one side of the field
*  Is a massive competitive advantage. So, um, I think it's bonkers about him. He turned 21 in june. Yeah
*  Like it's not like he's like one of those like we had kyle dugger, you know, he's like 24 when he was a rookie
*  Right, right, right
*  Like he's the opposite of that he could you could argue he should probably even be in college another year
*  but yeah, they they finally struck oil and that's why it's really hard for me to give up on this pats team because
*  The defense that they added in the draft combined with what they already had like the
*  Potentially could be an awesome unit, but the offense just can't stay out of its way and they make no explosive plays at all
*  Yeah, it's the president. I don't want to talk about that
*  Vegas is number seven. They took tyree wilson. Yeah, and people were confused when it happened
*  I think I do not see him going in that spot again. Who would you think they would take?
*  I know I think I saw that I saw the stat tyree wilson has zero pressures so far
*  He has 47 pass for snaps, which is tough. I think he's gonna have to you know, he's gonna have to learn
*  how to kind of
*  Vary his attack and not just be a pure power rusher
*  But but yeah, so I didn't have terry wilson there. I this one was hard, you know, I considered putting bryce young here
*  Um, I think they're probably happy with jimmy g though
*  And happy with aiden o'connell is the fourth rounder that too. I like that dude. That's true
*  Um, I put devin witherspoon. I I think obviously that the the you know, the jury's still out on him a little bit
*  He did give up a touchdown last last week on a flea flicker
*  So he kind of got out of position on a flea flicker trick play
*  Um, but for the most part he looked the part to me, you know when they played the lions and so
*  Um, he was breaking up passes. He was like a tone setter type of player for them
*  which is exactly what you expect I think the reason the seox loved him is because he's just
*  Uber uber competitive tough physical a guy who's gonna get his teammates pumped up on every single play like literally when you watch him
*  He even on the plays where he gives up a catch. He's like barking at the opponent. He's like he's just like an insane
*  Competitor which I love and I know the seox love that and so I still think he's still a top 10
*  Like type player and I think you know, obviously the raiders could use some help in the defensive secondary
*  So is it fair to say we just dropped a level there from christian gonzalez to uh witherspoon like we're in like a tier two now
*  Yeah, I think so. I think this is that was like sort of the blue chip type players
*  And then we get into some more question marks here
*  So yeah witherspoon potential blue chipper, but you're not as sure like gonzalez. You're more sure
*  Okay, number eight atlanta. You just took bijan from them. Are you gonna give them jimmy or gibs?
*  No, i'm gonna i'm this is where i'm going with brice brice young. I I consider I really didn't know where to put him
*  I think I considered uh, you know the raiders I consider the titans
*  I don't think mike vrabel is the type of guy who would take a
*  five foot
*  11 190 pound guy. I don't know. Maybe he would but um
*  I don't know the falcons to me
*  Look like the type of team that would really work well for brice young like they have a sportsman in place
*  They have a great run game, which they absolutely love to depend on they have a couple of really tall athletic
*  Pass catchers and cow pits and drake london who he can like throw to obviously the the skill player group is there is
*  Way better than in carolina. I think that gives him a better chance
*  Um, I don't know. What have you seen from brice? Have you watched a lot of panthers so far?
*  I watched uh, I actually watched some of both games because I had them in bets and especially the monday night game
*  I did not like how he looked on monday night, but that's also your second start
*  You're on monday night football. You have no weapons
*  Yeah, uh the saints I think have a good defense
*  That was one of the reasons I love them minus three and of course they ended up not getting the uh,
*  Not stopping the back door cover at the tail end of the game
*  but he just looks like he has no weapons to me and it's weird because
*  I like that carolina team last year in the second half of the year and I thought they had really found
*  An identity as this like physical, right?
*  You know foreman was really good for them and they would just kind of pound the ball and control the clock and
*  Now I don't know what they are. They have no weapons at all, right? They have like adam thalen. He's like
*  You know almost my age
*  um
*  And they don't have like that awesome running back. So I I don't even know what they're supposed to be
*  I've never been a frank wright guy
*  So I I do think he's in one of the worst situations you can be I would not give up on him yet
*  I know that's that's where I am. I'm like this isn't a situation. That's quite as bad as like the bears
*  System or support system or whatever, but it's a little worrisome to me so far what we've seen
*  Um, yeah, I agree, you know, and he's hurt already. So yeah, not great, right?
*  Okay. Number nine is philly who you just took baby rhino from them. So yeah, they take
*  So this was another tough one. I think they stick to the trenches
*  I gave him peter skoronsky the offensive lineman at a northwestern. He's been good so far
*  He had a 30 visit with them before the draft. So I know that they were at least interested in him
*  um, I don't know a guy that this just to me feels like a
*  A roseman pick where it's like he has five position versatility potentially and yeah adds on to their offensive line
*  Which is like a huge part of their identity, you know
*  He could play right guard left guard left tackle in theory like right tackle maybe even center. And so
*  Yeah, I just think he's you know, typical eagles pick Tennessee likes him and he missed he had an appendectomy
*  He'd think he missed last week, but he's probably not playing this week
*  and it's one of the reasons i'm nervous about Tennessee and cleveland because
*  Yeah, cleveland's defense looks incredible. I I think it's actually a real thing
*  So if you're just pulling blue chip offensive lineman out there, I don't like it. All right. I like that
*  He's a blue chip guy too, though. I think I probably
*  I could have put him even earlier here. But yeah
*  So chicago's at 10 they took darnel right who was another one of the tacos you think they just run that back or yeah
*  Yeah, I think so. All right, so we'll run that back for them to me
*  They're probably pretty happy with that pick which is the only thing they're happy about right now. I was gonna say like
*  Things we're happy about it. Do the bears it's the shortest list possible. Yeah, tennessee. You took skoransky from them
*  Yep. So what do you give them broderick jones? Give them another tackle? What do you paris johnson's still on the board here?
*  So I all right, I gave him paris johnson. I don't know for sure if he really fits their personality
*  Um, but they did sign andre dillard in the offseason
*  So I don't maybe I don't know what their personality or identity is because he's more finesse guy
*  Paris johnson, I think right now is a really good pass
*  Defender or sorry a pass that guy, but he's not as good of a run blocker
*  And so I mean, you know, maybe he doesn't fit the titans all that great
*  But I think he is the best tackle on the board here and they need offensive line help
*  Number 12 detroit gibbs. They they run that back gibbs is electric. I think yeah, you disagree
*  No, I don't I don't disagree at all. The here's what I did. I gave him ze flowers from boston college
*  Oh, you moved them up. Here's the reason why I think ze flowers could do some of the same things jemir gibbs does for them
*  But he also gives them an outside threat like with speed. I i'm a little bit worried. I'm a little bit worried about jamison williams
*  Um, I think jamison williams obviously very talented player
*  But we have not seen anything from him yet and he's like suspended for the first six weeks
*  I guess he's away from the team. Who knows what we're gonna get from him this year at all
*  Um, and I think this is a lions team that could really scheme up some fun ways to use ze flowers
*  And so basically i'm saying he could be
*  Sort of the jemir gibbs role but also play on the outside play all over the formation give them that speed
*  I I do love the jemir gibbs thing though. All right, save flowers at 12
*  That's a big win for baltimore because they got him at 22. I'm with you. He jumps out of the tv
*  Yeah, he he's just he's electric really fun. I'm glad lamar has him
*  Green bay at 13. They took lucas van ness
*  Who I I I think has been pretty spotty for them. Who'd you have? I redo I ran it back with you did
*  Okay. Yeah, I think so
*  He from what i've seen he kind of fits their
*  Um prototype he's big strong athletic fast
*  Versatile kind of like everything they're looking for
*  I don't know like I haven't studied him very closely yet like on all 22 or anything like that
*  But the times i've seen him like there was one play where he chased down justin fields in the open field
*  And I was like, okay this guy has something here. And so
*  Uh, yeah, I just kind of ran it back with them. I think he's he's fine
*  I mean, there's definitely a few other guys here that I could consider. I uh, I did consider broderick jones the tackle
*  Yeah, just because of you know, it sounds like bakhtiari just doesn't want to play on turf ever again
*  Maybe so that's kind of an interesting wrinkle here. But um, but yeah, I stuck with I stuck with van ness
*  All right, we'll do two more pittsburgh's at 14 and the jets are at 15 pittsburgh took broderick jones
*  The jets took will mcdonald who was a healthy scratch last week
*  Yeah, so i'm guessing we're gonna be redoing that one. Who do you have? I got this is a curveball here jordan adison
*  At a usc not a curveball to me. I I think he's another one who looks like he's got it
*  By the way, this guy adison won the balitnikov catching passes from one kenny pickett
*  A couple years ago
*  Do the whole thing where you pair up your college quarterback with your college receiver see if that helps obviously the sealers offense needs help everywhere
*  It can get um, you know, the offensive line has been spotty. I don't even think broderick jones is playing yet
*  They they don't really have him in at this point. And so
*  No, I don't think he started last week I looked it up. He has four snaps. So
*  um
*  I don't know what's going on there exactly
*  But yeah, I think jordan adison gives them an immediate boost obviously with diante johnson hurt
*  You know, he gets gets in there and then of course he has the chemistry built-in chemistry with kenny pickett who needs as much
*  Help as he can get so I love that one. I actually think this chargers vikings game this weekend. We might be hearing from him
*  Yeah, I could see that one thing you can do in the chargers is throw the top on I know they've had the worst defense
*  Yeah, adison enjoys that. All right
*  this will be fun the last pick just uh
*  Like the jets need another kick in the balls if you're a jigsaw, but we're about to do it
*  They took will mcdonald healthy scratch last week also 24 years old
*  I'd never the double red flag. I did not like that pick. He's also very skinny and light and I don't know
*  So so who do you have? I went this is one of those picks where you could go a million different ways
*  I considered jimmy or gibbs since he was still on the board here and then they were apparently interested in him. I went
*  Jackson smith and jigba from ohio state pairing back up with garrett wilson
*  I feel like the the jets quietly their their receiver corps completely fell apart over the offseason
*  Uh, cori davis got hurt. They traded away elijah moore or sorry cori davis got in uh, got he retired tired
*  They traded away elijah moore. Um
*  I don't think alan lazard is a difference maker
*  They're like randall cobb is getting snaps like what is going on with this receiver for they have they have nobody really passed
*  Garrett wilson, I think jackson smith a jigba
*  Um, you know pairing up with his old college teammate garrett wilson. That would be a lot of fun
*  That would be a big help for zac wilson clearly
*  You know, and then I like that one the jets just go get a different quarterback if it's not working out. I don't know
*  Who who for you has won the tight end the kinkade and um sam laporta and musgrave?
*  Who's your favorite? Oh and michael mayer who's been your favorite out of those four? I think probably laporta. Honestly, I think kinkade
*  Was my favorite coming in and it's not like he's done anything. That's really disappointing at this point
*  He's supplying he's getting a lot of looks and he's already, you know making plays for them
*  So that's saying something for a rookie tight end like I think I saw there's more rookie tight end catches in week one
*  Than like any other year before so it's like this is like a sort of a new era tight at rookie tight ends are going to come
*  In and basically because they're slot receivers at this point
*  Um, but I would say laporta has really looked apart. I mean he's like
*  He looks like kittle like when he's out there he's breaking tackles. He's just powering through guys
*  He's running after the catch. I mean, obviously there's the the iowa connection, but
*  He looks like kittle to me out there. And so i'm really excited about what he can do
*  What did you see your team played the lions last week? What did you see from the lions that made you either?
*  Think they were a playoff team or maybe a team that we overrated. Um
*  You I think you texted this to me. There's no difference between the seahawks and the lions like
*  I heard the same team. Yeah, they're the same team like they they have they're like a plucky
*  Good vibes team with like a really good offense, but a very spotty defense
*  I don't know exactly what to expect from either team either of these teams defenses
*  Um, but offensively the lions to me are one of the most fun teams to watch like the way that they
*  Mix things up the the skill players they have i'm honest. I'm on rossane brown is awesome. jimmy gibbs looks super electric
*  Laporte is a fun player and I think jared goff. Honestly, he kind of gets a bad rap for
*  He had a couple of very bad seasons, but he's he's a very solid quarterback kind of like in the same vein as jeno smith
*  So to me, like you said, these are very similar styled teams
*  It feels like there's only one playoff spot for the two teams and maybe it'll come down in that game
*  like some sort of tiebreaker or whatever, but
*  um
*  I'm with you. I didn't I thought the tric got too much hype
*  I thought jackson got too much hype and I thought the chargers got too much hype
*  But I think detroit roaring back and being a playoff team would be the least surprising out of those three
*  Yeah, the chargers just seem like they're headed toward a coach firing charger something awful. Yeah, they're just doing what they do
*  Yeah, um, all right, danny kelly we can hear in the fantasy football pod, which has been excellent
*  and uh, by the way, somebody spent 61 dollars on
*  The browns are on your back in one of my leagues this week out of 100 fab jerome ford. Yeah, jerome ford. Yeah
*  61 dollars, he might not be starting two weeks from now if creamhunk gets in shape
*  I don't know if I would have supported that one. Uh, good to see you. Say hi to the fantasy guys for me
*  All right, we'll do thank you
