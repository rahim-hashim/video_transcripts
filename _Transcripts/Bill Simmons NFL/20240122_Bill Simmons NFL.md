# The Sports Tragedy That Is the Buffalo Bills | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [January 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1p00TNoM3U)
*  New level losing, the deja vu gut punch,
*  the bills, they miss on the 44 yard wide,
*  I almost like, rarely in sports,
*  when you're watching sports, do you go,
*  I mean, we see everything, all we do is watch sports,
*  we gamble on sports, we just are immersed in it.
*  Rarely do you have the moment where you're like,
*  oh my God, that's what happened?
*  He pushed it right?
*  That's how they're gonna lose?
*  And you're just like, you know, 35 years of football history
*  comes flying at you in this one month, chiefs win,
*  my home speeds out again, and somehow Scott Norwood
*  is now involved in this game.
*  Ugh, I almost think if Sean McDermott could've talked
*  to him before he went out to make that kick,
*  like listen, if you're gonna miss,
*  just shank it left, or get it blocked,
*  Just get it blocked, just kick it in the head.
*  Or kick the holder in the head, do something different,
*  it can't be far right.
*  The only thing I'll say to Bills fans,
*  and I have a lot of Bills fans friends,
*  take solace knowing that had he made the kick,
*  the chiefs would've come down and scored and won
*  on a more heartbreaking fashion, I think.
*  Well, you think, how many lucky breaks did the Bills have
*  in this game, and they still lose?
*  We have the fumble that's just bouncing around,
*  and somehow the chiefs don't get that.
*  We have the chiefs who get the fake punt on fourth and five
*  and somehow get no points.
*  We get McCole Hardman first and goal from the one,
*  fumbling into the end zone.
*  Allen had a drop pick.
*  I mean on the flip side, I guess Allen could've hit digs
*  on that late one, but the chiefs were almost nine yards
*  of play, it felt like other than that one time
*  in the fourth quarter, they really couldn't stop them,
*  the Bills defense.
*  I just didn't feel like the Bills did quite enough to win.
*  Like they had explosive plays,
*  what how many did they have, three long balls,
*  and they went over three of those, right?
*  And if they were just missing that one awesome
*  kind of game tilting play, they just couldn't get it.
*  And then they cut to the fans, and it's just like,
*  are they number one?
*  I know we do this, because the Vikes are involved,
*  and the Lions are involved.
*  Who's the other team, there's four, and the Browns.
*  Cowboys, oh no, yeah, all right, yeah, Browns, yeah.
*  The Bills have had the most of these.
*  The Vikings have had approximately a lot of these,
*  but it feels like the Bills have had the worst ones.
*  The Bills fans are the best.
*  I mean, I don't want to fight it,
*  but it wasn't even snowing, and they found snow
*  to throw out the opposing receivers.
*  Yeah, did they bring their own snow?
*  I think they brought their own snow in this state.
*  Did they hand it out to the fans as they were coming in?
*  But yeah, it's terrible, and I was thinking like,
*  well, can't have the Lions and Bills fans
*  happy in one day, right?
*  It wasn't going to happen that way.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, it sucks for them.
*  I think they would have a lot of trouble next week, though.
*  We'll get to that game anyway against the Ravens,
*  but yeah, I mean, but again,
*  their offense looked so crisp in the first half.
*  Then you think like, oh, this is going to be tough
*  for the Chiefs to stop.
*  They really did hand it to them.
*  They only gave up seven in the second half.
*  Well, especially, we were texting with the Wise Guys group
*  about the Chiefs lost three defensive starters
*  in that first half.
*  Right.
*  In that halftime, I had a lot of Chief stuff.
*  I had the money line.
*  I had the plus two in half.
*  I had them in teases.
*  I had the 13-point tease that you guys made fun of.
*  And I'm like, I would love to hedge this and I can't.
*  There was just no way.
*  The Bills were up four at halftime.
*  I'm like, all right, got to ride out the Chiefs.
*  It ends up being, they were in 76 plays
*  and Kansas City runs 47.
*  Buffalo has the ball for 37 minutes.
*  Kansas City has it for 23.
*  But the difference, KC is 7.7 yards a play
*  and Buffalo is 4.7.
*  And that 4.7 was at like six
*  and just kept getting worse and worse.
*  They kept getting stuff.
*  Yeah, that was mostly first half.
*  Yeah, and the Chiefs without those.
*  Yeah, I'm not even sure what the Chiefs figured out.
*  Chiefs without the kneel downs is almost nine yards.
*  It was like eight and a half or something.
*  Yeah.
*  But yeah, it was, I don't know, it was an exciting game.
*  I don't know, like I said, the last third quarter
*  and fourth quarter with a little cat and mouse
*  where I feel like too many people were blaming the refs.
*  I'm like, okay, how about somebody make a big play here
*  so it doesn't come down to the refs?
*  Wouldn't that be nice just for once?
*  But yeah, it stinks because Alan is such, he's the man.
*  Like he really carried that team in the first half.
*  Again, I'm not gonna keep mentioning it,
*  but it really looked like they were on their way
*  to putting this thing away.
*  I agree he had a very good game.
*  At the same time, there were a couple of plays
*  he did not make in the second half
*  that I bet when they look at the tape,
*  he's gonna be kicking himself.
*  I think, you know, we were saying all week,
*  this is the biggest game of his career in a lot of ways.
*  He's gotta get over the KC hump.
*  He's gotta beat Mahomes in a playoff game.
*  He's gonna be the big winner out of this.
*  Peter Schrager and I talked about this Thursday.
*  It's like, all right, good morning football.
*  7.01 a.m. on Monday morning.
*  What's your lead topic?
*  Is it, oh my god, Mahomes?
*  Or is it, oh man, Buffalo, oh man, Josh Allen?
*  And that's what it turned out to be.
*  Alan's becoming a semi-tragic sports figure
*  because he is one of the best players in the league
*  and has been now for five years
*  and he can not get over the hump.
*  And these losses are starting to add up now
*  and he's right there and it comes down to one play
*  or one play that they didn't make
*  or one play the other team made.
*  And it felt like all this stuff was lining up today.
*  It was like, this is the game.
*  It's like, Hardman just fumbled it into the end zone,
*  the dumbest rule in any sport
*  where somehow it goes to the 20.
*  This is it.
*  This is your get out of jail free card
*  and they still get in their home and they still couldn't do it.
*  Yeah, and you know, you talk about your 13 point tees
*  and everything, how much would you have hedged
*  if I would have told you, all right,
*  Bills are gonna run for 182
*  and Alan's not gonna throw an interception.
*  I mean, he's perfect.
*  I think he was like 12 and 0
*  when he doesn't throw an interception, right?
*  Now, Mahomes didn't either,
*  which was just a spectacular back and forth.
*  The difference is like,
*  you kind of know what you're getting.
*  Like yesterday when the 49ers had the ball
*  down a few points with the last drive,
*  they were a minus 160 favorite.
*  Today when the Bills had the ball down a few points
*  striving to win, they were a minus 160 underdog
*  or plus 160 underdog.
*  Like, wow, how is that?
*  You have the home crowd and everything else.
*  Like the chiefs are the chiefs.
*  They figured out one way or another.
*  That's good information, Sal.
*  That's a good job by you.
*  That's a good job by you, Sal.
*  I made up most of those numbers, but yes.
*  Well, it was interesting.
*  What was the game we watched a week ago,
*  or two weeks ago, was Indianapolis Houston.
*  When part of the final drive became about,
*  we wanna chew up as much clock as possible
*  so they don't get the ball back
*  and it actually kinda fucked up the drive.
*  I felt a little like that with the Buffalo drive
*  near the end.
*  It was like, ah, eight minutes.
*  Can we string this out?
*  How long can we kinda just keep grinding out
*  and getting inside the 20 and making it,
*  and just maybe Mahomes never gets the ball back.
*  But they lost all their explosiveness,
*  and then they took the one shot on Diggs
*  and didn't get it.
*  I feel bad for Josh Allen.
*  The thing that stings is,
*  one more thing about Josh Allen,
*  that was the best play of the game.
*  Him rolling left and hitting Shakir in the end zone.
*  That was spectacular.
*  He threw an absolute frozen rope, too.
*  And that was on third and long, right?
*  Another play where you think, oh my God,
*  this is their year, this is their everything.
*  Well, first series, third and 17, they get it.
*  You think, all right, that's a nice start.
*  Then they got that third and 13.
*  He did hit a couple of third and longs.
*  Would you say he's the second best player in the league?
*  Like, throw MVP away, throw everything away,
*  and just like, who are the best players in the league?
*  And Mahomes is first.
*  And I think Allen, would you have him second,
*  or would you put somebody else there?
*  Well, what about Lamar Jackson,
*  who's actually probably gonna make the Super Bowl?
*  Well, we haven't seen him
*  even in a conference finals yet, though.
*  All right, Josh Allen's post.
*  So you would have Lamar Jackson over Josh?
*  I'd put Lamar over him, yeah.
*  Yeah, it's probably fair.
*  So Josh is third?
*  A couple of Cowboys linebackers, but yeah.
*  Yeah, I think he's good.
*  He's good enough to get third right now.
*  I was thinking of the,
*  I was trying to figure out
*  if there was a rivalry championship belt
*  that got passed over the last however many years.
*  Cause right now it does feel like it's Mahomes, Allen.
*  I don't feel like it's Mahomes Lamar.
*  Maybe that starts next week.
*  But before that it was Brady Mahomes.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Then I had Brady Goodell.
*  That was a fucking phenomenal two year rivalry.
*  That was awesome.
*  Brady Manning until Manning finally started
*  to deteriorate physically.
*  And then what Brady Manning really is,
*  it goes back to, I would say 2002, 2001 range.
*  Then it gets weird.
*  I had trouble figuring out the early 2000s, late 90s.
*  I thought Barry and Emmett was the best rivalry
*  in the 90s in a lot of ways.
*  OJ and Nicole, a lot of people would have that one.
*  Nice.
*  There was Marino and Montana,
*  even though they only went against each other
*  in the 84 Super Bowl.
*  But they were always kind of,
*  they were the two and then Elway was kind of over here
*  as this one man wrecking crew.
*  But we always felt like Marino and Montana
*  were just kind of slightly higher.
*  Any other rivalries?
*  I'm trying to think because, well I mean.
*  Jerry Rice and really nobody, right?
*  There was nobody who sniffed Jerry Rice during his peak.
*  You know what's weird, when I thought about this yesterday
*  because they said the Packers and 49ers
*  have met each other what, 10 times?
*  That's the most out of any teams facing off in the playoffs.
*  Is that really a rivalry?
*  Do you remember any huge,
*  I know there was a big farve, farve.
*  There was the Terrell Owens one.
*  The farve young game?
*  The Terrell Owens, that was a good one.
*  Yeah, all right.
*  But other than that, I don't know if it's a rivalry
*  even though they've met each other so many times.
*  Cowboys, Redskins, back in the day.
*  Or we might just be old
*  and we might not be able to remember games.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  We don't remember anybody.
*  But Mahomes Allen is clearly the game now.
*  And this is very similar to how Brady Manning went
*  where the Pats, the first few years,
*  the Pats were winning those.
*  And it turned into,
*  that's when I was writing my column
*  and I was doing the whole,
*  Brady's, what, should I do my own voice?
*  Brady's Bill Russell and Manning's Will Chamberlain.
*  Let me try.
*  I'm getting an invitation to myself.
*  Go ahead.
*  Brady's Bill Russell and Manning's Will Chamberlain.
*  I think you gotta go deep.
*  You gotta go.
*  Go deeper but more resonance.
*  I got it, all right.
*  Thanks for the advice.
*  But then all of a sudden in 06, it flipped
*  and Manning came back from 18 in the 2006 AFC title game.
*  The difference is the way this Chiefs team is built.
*  Like the Pats had a lot of,
*  all of a sudden he had no weapons.
*  That led to the 07 Pats team.
*  This KC team feels still is pretty sustainable
*  because of Mahomes' age,
*  because of his ability to just make
*  whatever work with anything.
*  Kelsey would be the one variable
*  but he looked pretty good today.
*  I'm sure they'll go get some receiver.
*  They'll have some draft picks to do some stuff.
*  Buffalo on the other hand,
*  I think there's some salary caps up with them.
*  Does McDermott come back now?
*  It's a weird year, right?
*  Because everybody was calling for his head
*  and Dorsey got it instead,
*  instead of the defensive coordinator.
*  It's weird that that all went on this year, right?
*  Still.
*  But yeah, I think he comes back.
*  I think they got him for another year.
*  I think the players like him enough.
