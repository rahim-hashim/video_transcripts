# The Browns Pull Off the Upset Against the 49ers | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [October 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw0FprJtSgY)
*  I felt like the right team won.
*  I thought the Browns, their defense was so great in that game.
*  They were all over the place.
*  And Stefanski, who I think, I mean, if you're thinking about
*  a long shot Browns odds or any type of bets,
*  you just have, just tear the tickets in half.
*  I just don't think he's a competent enough coach.
*  Some of the stuff they're doing on offense,
*  where you have the lead, you have momentum,
*  your defense is just crushing this Niners team.
*  And over and over again, PJ Walker is just like doing stuff
*  and trying to make plays offensively.
*  And to me, this was just a run three plays punt,
*  let your defense take it from there.
*  And for some reason they were just incapable of doing it
*  and they needed the lucky field goal at the end to win.
*  Yeah, the missed field goal.
*  Yeah, and look, if you're a 49ers fan,
*  you shouldn't be worried because this was a trap game, right?
*  We said it after the big Sunday night
*  against the Cowboys, why do they care about going to
*  Cleveland and winning by a lot?
*  I think it opened at three and a half when we did it
*  on Sunday because we thought Deshaun was playing.
*  And that's a whole other thing.
*  I don't know why everyone's not opening this up.
*  There are reports like, yeah, but he's gonna play next week.
*  How do you know if he didn't practice at all?
*  No one ever reports that a guy's gonna play next week
*  if he didn't practice at all the week before.
*  There's some shenanigans going on there
*  if we can't figure it out.
*  But yeah, McCaffrey getting banged up,
*  they had offensive line injuries,
*  and you know, Debo Samuel out,
*  and they still, like you said,
*  were a field goal miss away from doing it.
*  Trent Williams was a little banged up.
*  Yeah, we mentioned last week, this is the type of game,
*  the biggest question we had on the Niners was
*  could they stay intact for five months
*  with three skill position guys who just have had a tendency
*  to just disappear for chunks of time.
*  And you know, our guys that take a lot of hits,
*  and this was the type of game
*  where they were gonna take a lot of hits.
*  So you had that piece.
*  I think I set the over-under at two,
*  and then we couldn't decide whether it was an under or an over.
*  Cleveland's defense, 1,003 yards allowed in five games,
*  which is the third fewest since the 1970 merger.
*  Wow, wow.
*  They go into this game with the Deshaun thing,
*  at least they know this time that he's not playing, probably,
*  and then he doesn't play, and they have PJ Walker gets reps.
*  We didn't realize when we were doing the pod last week
*  that the guy who started last week
*  didn't know he was playing
*  until two and a half hours before the game.
*  I'm with you, this Watson story is bizarre.
*  They clear him to play two weeks ago.
*  He ends up deciding he's not gonna play.
*  They have a bye week coming up,
*  and we talked last week, or whenever this was,
*  two weeks ago about, oh, well, you know,
*  maybe they're just trying to be careful,
*  and now he doesn't play again.
*  And they didn't go to Houston during the bye, right, to rehab,
*  but still cleared to play, so it didn't really matter.
*  You know, I'm gonna say it.
*  Neither of us know anything.
*  No, no, no, I'm gonna say it.
*  I'm gonna say it.
*  He's a selfish guy.
*  Why, what are you doing?
*  What are you trying to get at?
*  You're trying to get on usp.com with some video?
*  Cause it now causes you to show selfishness.
*  I think, I'm gonna go as far as to say
*  that he's just a selfish human being.
*  I don't know.
*  It's a mess.
*  You can't see Sal's face, but he's laughing
*  as he's doing this.
*  We're doing the ESPN how to get on the front page
*  of the website content.
*  I'm laughing through tears,
*  cause I have the Browns to win this division.
*  I think it's a solid bet if their quarterback could play
*  when he's able to play.
*  Like, I just, I don't know, and they've won anyway,
*  and I still like it cause they're three and two,
*  and have a nice home field advantage, it seems.
*  And you're right, I think they allow like 3.1 yards per play.
*  They were awesome.
*  It's insane.
*  My shit detector's going off with the Deshawn story,
*  and I think yours is too.
*  Something doesn't add up,
*  and I don't know what the real story is,
*  but I don't feel like we're hearing it.
*  And I fully expect tomorrow, Tuesday, Wednesday,
*  some sort of something to come out,
*  or it's like, oh, actually, this is what's going on.
*  And I don't know what it is.
*  Could someone whisper us the real story,
*  like Michelle Tafoya calling or something?
*  Well, anybody.
*  Well, if they cleared him in a play two weeks ago,
*  and he's still hurt,
*  then that means their doctors are terrible.
*  So something doesn't add up with this.
*  The Stefanski piece.
*  Him and Staley are the two guys,
*  these guys that get aggressive in their own territory
*  because the analytics tell them to,
*  and they don't seem to have any sense for what the game is.
*  And in this game, it's like, man, we have a lead.
*  Our defense is gonna keep this lead.
*  Let's not fuck up the lead.
*  He's got PJ Walker thrown from his own 10.
*  I was just stupefied by that.
*  I'm with you on Stefanski,
*  but I don't think any of these coaches we thought were good
*  know how to hold a lead, including McDermott
*  and including Sirianni and all these teams that go far,
*  and we're gonna get to those games in a minute.
*  But for God sakes, it's a mystery every game.
*  Yeah, this was a just run and punt game.
*  I crowdsourced a couple of Browns fans.
*  First of all, it was the biggest upset win they've had
*  just from a Vegas spread standpoint since 2010.
*  It has to be in the running for one of the biggest wins
*  they've had since they got the team back in 1999.
*  I mean, I'm sure there was a Baker Mayfield game.
*  I'm sure there was a game during the Derek Anderson era,
*  but this was just an awesome win.
*  They do it at home.
*  They do it in this punch-mouth style,
*  and then they get this lucky break at the end
*  when the guy shanks.
*  So it seemed to be slightly harder kick
*  than the Niners were given the credit for.
*  They seemed very happy to do a 41-yarder on grass
*  not awesome weather with a guy
*  who hadn't been in a lot of spots like that.
*  I would love to ask a kicker, like, hey, does it make,
*  because in my mind and in your mind,
*  it makes a difference if you get it to 35 yards away
*  versus 41 or 42, right?
*  Would a kicker admit that, or are they just too proud
*  to say, hey man, I'm nailing them from 55 in practice,
*  so I don't care, put me anywhere?
*  There must be some range where they're like,
*  I'm lights out, because Elliot in the Eagles Jets games
*  were about to talk about, he missed the 37-yarder,
*  and that guy has hit the point
*  when he misses a field goal, I'm shocked.
*  He's like, he met Justin Tucker's in,
*  we're like, wow, he missed.
*  It wouldn't be like, yeah man,
*  I'll putt it from 14 feet or six feet, I don't care.
*  It's like, no, no, there's a percentage where you're better,
*  you got a sweet spot, for sure.
*  Brock Purdy, you just say bad weather,
*  he was due for one of those,
*  or did he vindicate a lot of people who were saying,
*  can everybody settle down on this Brock Purdy thing,
*  he's got great weapons,
*  he's got a really good offensive line,
*  and he's not nearly as good as he's looked
*  these first five weeks.
*  All those people are somehow right,
*  he did have some weapons pulled out of this game,
*  Trent Williams is playing hurt,
*  worst possible situation, not great weather,
*  he's going against the best defense in the league,
*  but we'll say, I'm filing it away for January,
*  because who knows where they're playing,
*  but in January, and especially now that the season drags on,
*  it could be the last weekend in January or something,
*  it could be like a 15, 20 degree,
*  it's hard not to think about this game
*  three months from now, right?
*  Yeah, and I think the worst thing that could happen to him
*  is me screaming about how he needs to get a contract
*  extension even though he's not due for one
*  for like a year and a half, all week long,
*  but I think we could answer one thing fairly definitively
*  between him and McCaffrey as far as MVP for the team,
*  it's McCaffrey, right?
*  It's gotta be Prisha McCaffrey.
