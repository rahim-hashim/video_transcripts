# The AFC East is the Hardest Division to Predict This Year | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NFL:** [September 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w)
*  We're gonna start with the AFC East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=0.0s)]
*  And if you remember last year, I did a whole Buffalo thing. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=1.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  And I was like, basically, are we sure? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=6.44s)]
*  Everyone's like, this is it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=9.64s)]
*  This is the team. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Super Bowl contender, pencil man, high over under. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  And then they went 13 and three. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=16.28s)]
*  One game got canceled. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=18.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=19.32s)]
*  So you could say I was wrong because I was like, I just don't see it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=20.28s)]
*  I don't, I don't see what everybody else is saying. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=23.28s)]
*  And then the playoffs, they crap the bed. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=25.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=28.28s)]
*  And now I feel even more strongly that it's a little smoke and mirrors. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=28.72s)]
*  And I'm just not a huge fan. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=32.24s)]
*  You want to be even more wrong than you were last year. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=33.239999999999995s)]
*  I'm either going to be more wrong or even more right. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=34.92s)]
*  I don't even know what's going to happen, but they're over under as 10 and a half. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=37.16s)]
*  They're plus 120 for the division. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  And I don't understand why do they get a free pass to Bills? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=42.72s)]
*  I'm just going to read this to you. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=45.0s)]
*  2019 round one, they blow a 16-0 lead to Houston, losing the playoffs. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=46.04s)]
*  2020, they almost lose to washed up Phil Rivers. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  And then they beat Lamar Jackson and Huntley that game where they had Ravens, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=56.32s)]
*  they had quarterback injuries. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=59.32s)]
*  Then they get smoked by Casey. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=61.32s)]
*  2021 kill the Pats. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  They had the 13 seconds loss to Casey. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=64.8s)]
*  Last year barely beat Skyler Thompson. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  They win by three. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=70.84s)]
*  He was very good. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=71.84s)]
*  And they get killed by Cincinnati. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=72.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=74.64s)]
*  And we do this thing with football that we do not do in basketball where we just [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=75.28s)]
*  kind of move forward and we forget things that happened like six, seven months ago. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=80.16s)]
*  They got manhandled by Cincinnati. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=84.08s)]
*  What is different about the Bills this year? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  So here's what I think. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=87.6s)]
*  I don't think we forget. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=88.56s)]
*  I think everybody's playing off. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  I think it's recency bias off their last game or the Skyler Thompson game or whatever. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=91.6s)]
*  I don't think people are looking at some, this is a regular season thing we're [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=96.28s)]
*  talking about, right? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=99.52s)]
*  Over under wins. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  So I think the Bills get screwed. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=101.28s)]
*  There's some bias talking about the Bills over under because we're looking at the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=103.16s)]
*  playoffs and we think, well, Josh Allen isn't up there with Patrick Mahomes and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=106.96s)]
*  Joe Burrow. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  So I like them to go under like, no, that doesn't make sense. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=112.0s)]
*  The Cowboys very good regular season team in the right. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=115.24s)]
*  And yeah, they are. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=117.8s)]
*  They are. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=119.32s)]
*  I make a list of the teams that have won 12 games in each of the last two years. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=120.28s)]
*  Can I make a list of quarterbacks I don't believe in? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=124.11999999999999s)]
*  Make a list. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=126.0s)]
*  Make a list. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=126.52s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=127.11999999999999s)]
*  Chiefs, Cowboys. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=127.64s)]
*  Stop. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  Stop with your list. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=129.28s)]
*  Because you're going to be wrong about everything. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=130.16s)]
*  At least you made a list finally. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  But I'm saying there's bias. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=132.04s)]
*  Like people love the Lions because they beat the Packers in week 18, that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=133.28s)]
*  terrible Packers team. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=136.92s)]
*  And they're like, oh my God, look at these Lions. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=138.04s)]
*  Like, all right, they didn't make the playoffs. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=140.12s)]
*  Also they had the same record as the Steelers down the stretch, which [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=141.52s)]
*  and only the Lions mattered for some reason. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=144.24s)]
*  So I think like you say, you know, they won 13, so they're going to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  regress to 11, that's still over. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=148.72s)]
*  And that's why I have them over and you could go over their playoff stuff, but [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=150.84s)]
*  they've hit their win total over five of the last six years. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=154.4s)]
*  You know, I'd like Ken Dorsey in his second year as OC. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=159.16000000000003s)]
*  That seems to be when it clicks with a quarterback and Josh Allen was bad. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=162.0s)]
*  You just threw a second year as OC is one of your reasons? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=165.28s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  That was like one of your top reasons. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=168.76000000000002s)]
*  Go back, go back to all of them. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=170.16s)]
*  But anyway, look, it can't get a lot worse than 19 turnovers for Josh Allen. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=171.6s)]
*  And they still won 13 games. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=176.76s)]
*  I get it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=178.56s)]
*  And he was hurt the second half of the year. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=179.04s)]
*  And they lost to the Vikings, that really, really stupid game. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=180.32s)]
*  One of the dumbest in history. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=183.04s)]
*  So I'm going over with the Bills here. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=184.44s)]
*  I have them at 11 exactly. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=186.16s)]
*  I think their schedule is really hard. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=188.04s)]
*  They play Rogers twice, two of twice, assuming he plays Mahomes, Herbert, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  Burrow, Lawrence, Hertz and Dac. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=195.64s)]
*  Pretty rough. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=198.48s)]
*  I just, I did my player rankings thing again that I know you hate. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  Did I mail it to you this year? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=203.68s)]
*  You did. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=204.60000000000002s)]
*  I spent even more time on it this year. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  I added coaches. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  I went nuts. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  You have a weird thing where you assign the point value to everybody as it [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=207.96s)]
*  compares to Kelly Trappucca from 1978. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=212.04000000000002s)]
*  That's true. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  It's a mustache. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=214.88000000000002s)]
*  It was brilliant. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=215.52s)]
*  That's what I do. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=216.0s)]
*  Quarterbacks are ranked the highest, so they do well because Allen is an eight [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=217.12s)]
*  pointer out of 10, Mahomes is a 10, Allen is an eight. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  Rest of the team, like if you're talking, you know, either semi elite or elite [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=222.84s)]
*  guys, Diggs, Ed Oliver, he's like the 19th best defensive lineman. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=227.56s)]
*  Milano's good. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  White, Hyde, Poirier, McDermott's an above average coach. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  I don't think there's as much talent here as people seem to think, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=237.88s)]
*  especially in the Lions. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  I think they're okay. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=242.39999999999998s)]
*  So the only answer I would accept for the 11 win bill season is it's Josh Allen. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=243.76s)]
*  And he's just going to go 11 and six every year. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=248.32s)]
*  If you're telling me that, I don't really have an argument. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=250.2s)]
*  If you're just like, put this guy, he's basically the Mitchell Gobert jazz. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=252.51999999999998s)]
*  He's going to win 50 games. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=256.48s)]
*  You're not going to go that far in the playoffs, but he's going to get you to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=258.0s)]
*  15 and 32 NFL version. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=260.64s)]
*  That's 10 and seven, 11 and six. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=262.64s)]
*  I'm going under those. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=264.6s)]
*  So, all right. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=265.4s)]
*  I mean, I think it's a 10 and seven, nine and eight type of thing. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=266.44s)]
*  This is what, and they start with a healthy Trudevius, White and Jordan [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=269.12s)]
*  Poirier that's big. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=271.88s)]
*  I think Vaughn Miller's out first few games. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=273.16s)]
*  That's also big. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=275.36s)]
*  The other way they're, their rush rate is like 36% when he's there and 20% when [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=276.2s)]
*  he's not, but he's old, but I just think this is one of those teams that has a [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=280.92s)]
*  first place schedule every year and still gets through it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=285.28s)]
*  Double digit wins. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=288.79999999999995s)]
*  In this case, they need 11. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=289.96s)]
*  And also look at, you know, you could go to crazy analytics, but there are only [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=291.47999999999996s)]
*  four and two in the division last year. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=294.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=296.96s)]
*  So it's not like they were six and O. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=297.23999999999995s)]
*  So you say, oh, the division's much better. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=298.44s)]
*  Are they going to be two and four? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=300.28s)]
*  Is that where they're going to lose their two games? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=301.44s)]
*  Well, aren't we going to know that Monday night they're at the Jets and that's [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=303.23999999999995s)]
*  one of those, if it's all in one, then all of a sudden they're like, hmm, what [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=307.76s)]
*  happens with the team? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=312.0s)]
*  Let's go to the Jets. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=313.96s)]
*  They're over under is nine and a half. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=314.56s)]
*  They have gotten the most kind of hype slash a rational love that I think I've [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=316.4s)]
*  ever seen in my life, considering Rogers wasn't good last year and it's going to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=324.32s)]
*  be 40 years old and they're the Jets. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=327.96s)]
*  And we're the subject of an entire Kirby enthusiasm episode about a guy who [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=330.48s)]
*  killed himself and might've might've done it because of the Jets. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=334.68s)]
*  They're all over the place. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=337.8s)]
*  They're right. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  They're hard knocks. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=339.68s)]
*  Kirby. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=340.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=340.8s)]
*  All over the place. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=340.84s)]
*  The Cranals the other day, they ran the theme. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=341.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=343.56s)]
*  I guess my number one question is, is it more fun if the Jets are really good or [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=344.08s)]
*  incredibly disappointing? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=350.88s)]
*  Like you have no dog in this race. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=352.32s)]
*  What's more fun actual Jets juggernaut and their fans getting all into it or [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=353.88s)]
*  they just fucking suck right out of the gate. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  I got a minute to get bleeped on that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=360.68s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=362.24s)]
*  Uh, wait, what words get bleeped? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=363.04s)]
*  Uh, the F bomb that I just said. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=367.36s)]
*  The F is for Fandle on Fandle. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=367.92s)]
*  Oh, is that right? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=369.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=370.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=370.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=371.24s)]
*  It looked right down the barrel. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=371.32s)]
*  And there you go. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=372.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=373.48s)]
*  Uh, I think the, the best result for people who don't have a dog in the race is [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=374.0s)]
*  for the Packers to be good and the Jets to be bad. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=380.88s)]
*  And I think Fandle has actually a parlay that, that, uh, coincides. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=383.56s)]
*  I kind of believe that could happen. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=388.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=389.4s)]
*  Cause I like the Packers. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=389.76s)]
*  We'll get to that in the NFC one, but yeah, I think that is funny. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=390.88s)]
*  If, and then the stuff starts coming out from the green Bay side around week [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=393.71999999999997s)]
*  three, week four, we're a real team this year. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=397.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=400.24s)]
*  It's not, it's not one guy over here and 44 guys over here. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=401.12s)]
*  It's 45 guys swimming the same way. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  We all go to Culver's after the game. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=410.76000000000005s)]
*  That said, I do think the Jets are going to be, I think they were good. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=411.56s)]
*  In spite of what happened last year, you know? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=415.96000000000004s)]
*  And so Aaron Rodgers, everyone's like, well, what if he's not the MVP, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=418.0s)]
*  Aaron Rodgers from two years ago? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=421.08000000000004s)]
*  Like, and I'm like, well, what if he's not the terrible, whatever we saw, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=422.68s)]
*  that disaster of a mess? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=426.84000000000003s)]
*  I don't know what that, uh, the Sean Kaiser imitation he was putting on last [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=428.04s)]
*  year, Kaiser so say, so right in the, what if he's in the middle? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=432.4s)]
*  What if he's Kirk cousins? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=436.48s)]
*  Can this team win 10 games? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=437.84s)]
*  That's where I have them. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=439.44s)]
*  I do think they're, what if he's Dak Prescott? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=440.4s)]
*  What if he's right in the middle and he's Dak Prescott? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=443.32s)]
*  Then I win 12 games like he did last year in the year before. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=445.56s)]
*  We're going to know right away because my fear with them and the reason I have [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=448.36s)]
*  two reasons that I'm not a believer. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=452.16s)]
*  One is that I don't think they can block. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=453.72s)]
*  And there's been a lot of McKay, Becton hike. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=456.24s)]
*  He was like, he started the last game and Rogers has taken him under his wing. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=459.12s)]
*  And the guy has been one of the most disappointing first round picks in [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=462.56s)]
*  general, and then Dwayne Brown on the other side. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=466.44s)]
*  I don't know if I trust him either. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=468.35999999999996s)]
*  So I really worry about their O line and Rogers when he doesn't get protection, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=469.52s)]
*  there's a slew of stats with that. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=472.84s)]
*  Then Robert Sala, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=475.59999999999997s)]
*  not Robert Sala. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=478.56s)]
*  Robert Sala, we've had two years with him. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=479.91999999999996s)]
*  Did he ever jump off the TV? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=482.28s)]
*  We were like, man, this guy. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=483.88s)]
*  It's looking good. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=485.59999999999997s)]
*  This guy's running a tight ship. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=487.0s)]
*  Man, good game management from Robert Sala. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=488.68s)]
*  I never felt that way once. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=491.4s)]
*  I always felt like I didn't understand what he was doing. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=493.68s)]
*  Whatever he did with Zach Wilson was insane last year. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=496.59999999999997s)]
*  And I just, you know, if it's 40 year old QB and a coach out on trust and an [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=499.56s)]
*  offensive line on our trust in a really tough division with a hard schedule, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=504.59999999999997s)]
*  I think I'm out. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=508.2s)]
*  That schedule is rough. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=509.44s)]
*  That first six, if they go two and four and the media. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=510.44s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=514.08s)]
*  It's the first seven. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=514.6s)]
*  It's the worst. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=515.4000000000001s)]
*  Buffalo at Dallas, New England, KC at Denver, Philly at the Giants. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=516.1600000000001s)]
*  Then they got the Chargers in week nine on Monday night. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=521.2s)]
*  That's really rough. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=523.24s)]
*  That could be like two and six. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=523.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=525.24s)]
*  So then that's going to be tough to hurdle. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=525.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=528.24s)]
*  So I honestly think like three and three out of those first six, but I get what [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=528.6s)]
*  you're saying with Sala. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=532.96s)]
*  I thought it was interesting. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=533.72s)]
*  Did you see the hard knocks that started with him listing his four stages of [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=534.88s)]
*  competitor, like he only gets everybody in this room. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=538.8000000000001s)]
*  It's like a Ted talk. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=541.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=542.7199999999999s)]
*  And Aaron Rodgers has to pretend he's interested. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=542.9599999999999s)]
*  He's like commander, competitor, survivor. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=544.76s)]
*  And there was some other thing in there. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=548.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=549.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=549.88s)]
*  I'm not sure what Pearl Jam might've been three. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=550.8s)]
*  I'm not sure what it was, but anyway, so that was, those were the four. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=552.2399999999999s)]
*  I was like, this poor bastard has to come up and all because of Vince Lombardi, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=555.0s)]
*  who said, winning isn't the only anything. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=558.56s)]
*  See, now I can remember winning isn't everything. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=560.92s)]
*  It's the only thing. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=562.68s)]
*  Now all these idiot coaches have to come up with something to top that. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=563.64s)]
*  And they're not even close. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=567.12s)]
*  So, yes, I think it's, he's lacking. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=568.24s)]
*  Nathaniel Hackett seems to be a bit of a joke. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=572.0799999999999s)]
*  You see him. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=575.1199999999999s)]
*  I mean, he was the worst head coach of the last 10 years. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=575.9599999999999s)]
*  And then the thing now is like, well, he's getting, gets along great with Rodgers. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=578.4s)]
*  And, you know, as an offensive coordinator, he's great. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=583.1999999999999s)]
*  And we even made fun of this guy for four months last year. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=585.16s)]
*  And then he got fired during the season, which never happens. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=588.1199999999999s)]
*  Private eye. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=590.04s)]
*  Nate Hackett loves Austin Powers. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=590.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=592.16s)]
*  So I'm going over, but really need to be three and three after those first six. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=592.52s)]
*  I would, the schedule is so hard. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=597.04s)]
*  Their defense would have to be like incredible. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=600.2s)]
*  I'm not ruling it out. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=602.48s)]
*  I think this division's really hard. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=603.76s)]
*  Last year we did really well on this. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=605.9200000000001s)]
*  I went 24, seven and one on the overrunners. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=607.9200000000001s)]
*  I think he went like 2011 and one. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=610.32s)]
*  I felt like I was like locked in. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=612.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=614.2800000000001s)]
*  So I might not be right on the jets. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=614.96s)]
*  No, because I have my, well, we disagree on both because I have over for Miami and [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=617.0s)]
*  I don't feel great about that either. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=622.5200000000001s)]
*  Miami is nine and a half. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=624.08s)]
*  They're plus two 90 for the division, which I really like. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=625.84s)]
*  And I actually think they win the division and the rub is well, two could get [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=629.12s)]
*  hurt. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=634.0799999999999s)]
*  He three concussions last year. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=634.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=636.12s)]
*  I was watching a lot of judo to roles and how he studied jujitsu and judo, like how [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=637.84s)]
*  to roll judo. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=644.52s)]
*  He studied bad judo to know how not to roll. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=647.48s)]
*  But he did all this stuff to try to do preventative. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=651.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=654.52s)]
*  I didn't know how to fall. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=654.84s)]
*  Basically, if somebody was falling. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=655.84s)]
*  Now the counter would be, well, if somebody's 350 pounds of falling and you, there's [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=657.12s)]
*  really, or throwing you from behind. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=660.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that kind of happens. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=663.16s)]
*  But I, I'm somehow back in on judo to a, and the, and the dolphins, because I like [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=665.7199999999999s)]
*  their schedule a little bit more, even though like they play at Kansas city, but [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=671.0s)]
*  it's in London, right? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=674.8s)]
*  They have like a couple of lucky things like that. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=676.24s)]
*  They're at Philly, which is brutal. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=678.68s)]
*  They're at Baltimore, but for the most part, it's not awful, but I just think [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=680.0799999999999s)]
*  they're Dallas at Baltimore and Buffalo. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=683.8s)]
*  That's tough. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=685.68s)]
*  So you gotta get your eight, nine wins before, before that stretch. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=686.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=689.96s)]
*  So I, I don't need, I don't think they're going to go like 11 and six, anything [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=691.44s)]
*  like that, but I think 10 and seven is reasonable and that might win the division. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=695.36s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=698.2800000000001s)]
*  I have them way under and I know it's a point of contention with the, on that text [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=698.76s)]
*  chain with JJ, got married. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=702.9200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=705.1600000000001s)]
*  He got very upset, you know, his big dolphins fan. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=705.5200000000001s)]
*  I have them at seven and 10 because I think two is going to be treated differently. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=707.8000000000001s)]
*  They wrote, we wrote rules for him, right? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=712.08s)]
*  Anything that's close to like, if he gets thrown on his shoulders, like, well, did [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=714.4000000000001s)]
*  that get you thrown on your head there? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=717.5200000000001s)]
*  He's like, no, no, no. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=719.12s)]
*  Well, you're going to have to come out anyway. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=719.76s)]
*  Like anything that's a concussion that you'd sit one or two games, he's going [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=721.08s)]
*  to have to sit four or five games. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=724.96s)]
*  You're going to have him panicking on the sideline, like pissed off, like, why am I [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=726.6s)]
*  out, those kinds of things, it's not even going to be his fault, I think. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=730.0400000000001s)]
*  But the rules are such that it's going to be, plus he announced that he was [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=732.84s)]
*  thinking of retiring in the beginning of the off season. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=737.0s)]
*  That concerned me. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=739.9200000000001s)]
*  I did factor that in. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=740.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, listen, I think the Jets or the Dolphins win and it's a coin toss to me. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=741.8399999999999s)]
*  And I went with the Dolphins. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=745.68s)]
*  I think it's one of those two. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=747.1999999999999s)]
*  If nephew Kyle said, I'm thinking of abandoning audio altogether. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=748.12s)]
*  In fact, I might not even speak. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=752.3599999999999s)]
*  He said that like two days ago. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=753.16s)]
*  He did? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=753.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's bad. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=754.3599999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=754.9599999999999s)]
*  So you stayed with him. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=755.1999999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=755.92s)]
*  He goes back to upstate New York every once in a while and I don't know what happens. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=756.3199999999999s)]
*  He just goes to bars with his friends from high school and we don't know [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=759.3599999999999s)]
*  if he's ever coming back. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=761.9599999999999s)]
*  It's not untrue, Kyle. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=763.3599999999999s)]
*  I'm going to open a bar at Bikifty. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=765.16s)]
*  That's my dream. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=766.4s)]
*  So there he goes. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=767.5999999999999s)]
*  This is what I'm dealing with. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=768.3199999999999s)]
*  We can get him. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=769.3199999999999s)]
*  Bad example. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=769.88s)]
*  Defense for them, Wilkins, Phillips, Baker, Howard, Ramsey, when he comes back in Holland. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=771.76s)]
*  They're loaded. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=775.9599999999999s)]
*  I think they're as loaded as the Jets. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=777.0799999999999s)]
*  I guess. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=778.92s)]
*  I feel like they're coach better too. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=779.28s)]
*  I like McDaniel. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=780.64s)]
*  I thought he was good last year. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=781.3599999999999s)]
*  I don't know what to make of that guy. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=782.28s)]
*  I do want to like him and I guess the team likes him, which doesn't really matter. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=783.4799999999999s)]
*  But yeah, Ramsey out till December. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=787.9599999999999s)]
*  That hurts a little. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=790.0s)]
*  Lose Byron Jones, Gosecki. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=790.88s)]
*  Not too bad. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=793.28s)]
*  They didn't have a first round pick, but you know, their defense was not great. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=794.0s)]
*  They forced 14 turnovers. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=797.52s)]
*  It's hardest to gauge a defense, right? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=799.1600000000001s)]
*  Cause I think like the three best defenses last year, 21 went 7th, 10th, and 14th in 22. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=802.1600000000001s)]
*  So really like an offense, you can be like, all right, it's going to be very similar, but the defense is tough too. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=808.32s)]
*  Well, they did bring in Fangio, which everybody was excited about. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=813.48s)]
*  And he has a lot to work with. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=817.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=820.08s)]
*  I, for some reason, there's like a Miami vibe. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=820.44s)]
*  Like Miami is probably going to stumble into Dame Lowe soon. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=824.44s)]
*  Oh, look at that. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=827.4000000000001s)]
*  Made the finals last year. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=828.32s)]
*  How long guys before the basketball reference? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=829.6800000000001s)]
*  He did it. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=831.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=832.08s)]
*  Dame Lowe. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=832.5200000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=833.0400000000001s)]
*  Last day of C's team, New England. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=833.84s)]
*  I'm just going over the seven and a half. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=836.12s)]
*  Seven and a half is insulting. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=838.12s)]
*  Well, so is the roster. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=840.84s)]
*  Their defense is going to be really good. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=842.32s)]
*  Their special teams is going to be really good. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=843.96s)]
*  I actually liked their receivers. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=846.0400000000001s)]
*  I thought Ramandre was excellent last year and it seems like they rebuilt Mack. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=847.72s)]
*  They went eight and nine last year. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=851.72s)]
*  They finally have an offensive coordinator. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=853.12s)]
*  The offensive line is the question. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=855.5600000000001s)]
*  They have the same question the Jets have with a better coach. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=856.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=859.56s)]
*  Rogers versus Mack. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=860.96s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=862.0s)]
*  Rogers is going to be 40 years old, but if they don't go eight and nine, I'm going to be shocked. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=862.36s)]
*  I have them at 10 and seven. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=866.92s)]
*  I think they make the playoffs. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=867.96s)]
*  You know, I'm not a homer. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=869.2s)]
*  No, I know you're not. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=870.16s)]
*  Because I went under last year and I was adamant they were going to sign. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=870.68s)]
*  I know. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=872.72s)]
*  I have a wonder. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=873.32s)]
*  I think the defense is going to be really good. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=873.72s)]
*  I was hoping they signed Hopkins just so you could be like, I think this team's going to win 11. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=875.48s)]
*  No, I didn't want Hopkins. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=879.4399999999999s)]
*  No, I know. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=880.08s)]
*  I wanted, I like you to be excited for your team. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=880.68s)]
*  It's good for the podcast. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=883.4s)]
*  Is that what this is? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=885.48s)]
*  Because I get sad by week four. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=887.04s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=888.4s)]
*  So then it's funny when they go five and 12, but they're 25 and 25 since Brady left. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=888.9599999999999s)]
*  If I would have told you that how many years ago? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=894.4399999999999s)]
*  Three, four years ago. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=896.64s)]
*  Would you have taken that? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=897.7199999999999s)]
*  You would have, you would have said, yeah, yeah, we've had. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=899.64s)]
*  I mean, that seems reasonable, right? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=901.7199999999999s)]
*  You lose the best football player of all time. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=903.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=905.4399999999999s)]
*  And you go 500 after he leaves. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=906.0s)]
*  That actually seems like a, like a bonus. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=907.68s)]
*  So I think you're going to have a lot of knuckleball games, like 17, 14 type games, right? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=909.4s)]
*  And you just have to be on the right side of that coin flip because no matter what he's had, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=914.04s)]
*  the last 11 years Belichick's had a top 10 defense. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=918.6s)]
*  So you're going to be there. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=921.12s)]
*  You mentioned Judon's numbers 15 and a half. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=922.08s)]
*  We're loaded on defense. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=923.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=924.8s)]
*  Like legitimately, we may have the best second. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=925.08s)]
*  You're going to shut teams down and probably Bill O'Brien for Patricia was maybe the best [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=926.84s)]
*  swap in the AFC East in term, not even in terms of coaches, just like any pickup. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=931.64s)]
*  So we had like a mole as the offensive coordinator. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=935.88s)]
*  He was like trying to destroy us from within. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=939.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=941.56s)]
*  That's what our office was last year. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=942.2s)]
*  It worked. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=943.68s)]
*  It was the most frustrating football experience of my life. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=944.04s)]
*  Look, they go at Philly. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=946.56s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=948.52s)]
*  Home Philly, home Miami first two at the Jets at Dallas. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=949.0799999999999s)]
*  And we're going to know after four games. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=952.5999999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=954.3599999999999s)]
*  If they're own four or one and three after those first four, it's probably not happening, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=954.68s)]
*  but if they can get through that two and two. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=958.2399999999999s)]
*  It's tough to check anything off as a win with Mac Jones. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=959.8s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=963.4399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=964.8s)]
*  Mac Jones, the guy who was San Francisco wanted to trade up for and then Shanahan got [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=965.0s)]
*  bullied and then take a trade lands. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=968.8s)]
*  He did everything right. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=970.16s)]
*  They're play rankings. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=971.36s)]
*  They have a lot of like good players, no real great ones except for Judon, but they nailed [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=972.24s)]
*  the draft. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=978.28s)]
*  I think is the big case for them. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=978.8s)]
*  They were good last year. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=980.8s)]
*  All three of the top picks are going to play. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=981.92s)]
*  They drafted a kicker and a punter. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=984.04s)]
*  The punter is incredible. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=985.68s)]
*  We the worst punter in the league last year. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=987.08s)]
*  And I like for people on Fandl TV, I'm using we like I'm on the team. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=989.08s)]
*  Yeah, I noticed that. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=992.84s)]
*  Our punters like it's like five seconds in the air. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=994.12s)]
*  It's up there forever. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=996.52s)]
*  The camera has to they have to like kind of tilt it up to find out where the ball is. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=997.68s)]
*  He's going to hit the scoreboard in Dallas. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=1001.6s)]
*  It's a it's a lot. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=1003.72s)]
*  Well, that's your punter. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=1004.52s)]
*  When you point to him like that's our that's my punter. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=1005.72s)]
*  That's my punter, baby. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=1008.0799999999999s)]
*  Berenger. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=1009.4s)]
*  I think they go 10 and 7. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=1011.6s)]
*  I don't feel great about the prediction. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=1013.88s)]
*  And I think this division is the hardest of the eight. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=1015.6s)]
*  Really? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=1018.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I really do. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=1018.4399999999999s)]
*  We win all four different. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=1019.24s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=1020.84s)]
*  That's why I'm not surprised. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrnhOjgX3w&t=1021.36s)]
