# Supreme Court orders new trial for Richard Glossip
**CBS News:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA)
*  developing news out of Oklahoma where a convicted killer on death row will get [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=0.0s)]
*  a new trial. So says the U. S. Supreme Court in the case of a man named [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=3.72s)]
*  Richard Glossop. The justices threw out Glossop's 1997 murder conviction and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  death penalty after agreeing he did not get a fair trial in the killing of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=12.4s)]
*  Barry Van Trees. Let's bring in CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=16.48s)]
*  help break this down on how this played out. Jessica, what were the turning [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=20.48s)]
*  points with the Supreme Court? The turning point for the Supreme Court is [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=23.64s)]
*  really the idea that Mr Glossop did not get a fair trial. Now we should say [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=27.48s)]
*  that he's maintained his innocence all along, but that wasn't the question for [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=32.0s)]
*  the Supreme Court. The question was whether the trial was conducted in a [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=36.24s)]
*  way again that it was fair that adhered to the Constitution. And when a majority [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=40.32s)]
*  of the court said is that there were real problems with that trial, and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=44.6s)]
*  specifically the problem is that the key witness, the man who actually [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=48.28s)]
*  committed the murder, the idea is that this was the murder for hire, that the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=52.16s)]
*  man who actually committed the murder said on the stand that he'd never seen a [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=55.94s)]
*  psychiatrist when in fact the state, the prosecutors knew that he had seen a [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=59.94s)]
*  psychiatrist and he had some serious psychiatric issues. What Judge [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=64.3s)]
*  Justice Sotomayor said is that that could have affected the jury. The [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=68.94s)]
*  idea that the key witness had credibility issues is something that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=73.7s)]
*  the jury needed to know about. So how does this affect the original case, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=77.62s)]
*  Jessica? Well the original case at this point, we have a majority of the Supreme [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=81.34s)]
*  Court saying proceeded in a way that had too many defects and so now it is up [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=85.54s)]
*  to the prosecutors as to whether or not they want to retry. We've already heard [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=90.7s)]
*  reporting that there if there is a retrial that the death penalty would not [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=95.5s)]
*  be on the table. So this is you know another amazing twist in this legal [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=100.26s)]
*  saga. Mr. Glossop has had three final meals read. It really is a huge victory [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=104.66000000000001s)]
*  for him. So where does he stay while all of this plays out? Well I think that will [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=112.22s)]
*  depend on what the prosecution, what the state of Oklahoma wants to do, whether [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=117.66s)]
*  or not they want to retry him or whether or not they opt not to. My suspicion is [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=122.38s)]
*  that again, suspicion based on the reporting is that there will be a [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=128.38s)]
*  retrial. I think the reporting indicates that they do not think that he is [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=131.7s)]
*  factually innocent. That there were, they said, problems with the trial but not [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=135.28s)]
*  enough to show that they wouldn't want to move forward in the case. But again, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=140.14s)]
*  that's up to them at this point. Wow Jessica Levinson, thank you so much. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=144.01999999999998s)]
*  Always great talking to you. Yet another case we'll be watching. We know you will [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=147.9s)]
*  be as well. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XZxPQFvbLA&t=151.74s)]
