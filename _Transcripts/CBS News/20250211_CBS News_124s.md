# Steve Bannon pleads guilty in border wall fraud case
**CBS News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU)
*  As we reported, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon has just pleaded guilty in a New York [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=0.0s)]
*  City courtroom. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=5.04s)]
*  He's charged with fraud in the so-called We Build the Wall scheme. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=6.04s)]
*  CBS News political reporter and attorney Katrina Kaufman has been in court following this and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=9.64s)]
*  joins me now to talk about it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=14.88s)]
*  So Katrina, first of all, what is the We Build the Wall scheme? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=16.72s)]
*  People need to understand what that is, because it's been out of the public eye for a bit. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=20.88s)]
*  So, basically, this was a scheme where Steve Bannon, along with a few other people, raised [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=25.08s)]
*  over $25 million. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=33.76s)]
*  And it was intended to, they said, build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=36.48s)]
*  They were going to do it privately. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=41.2s)]
*  And they did ultimately build about three miles of wall. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=42.8s)]
*  But the accusations here are that they were funneling money to the CEO of this organization [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=45.92s)]
*  in particular, and the three other people were already sentenced to prison in a federal [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=52.12s)]
*  trial, or sorry, in a federal case. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  But at the time, Steve Bannon was pardoned by President Trump. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=62.68s)]
*  That was during his first presidency. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  So New York then brought these charges against Steve Bannon in this state case that we just [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=69.56s)]
*  had the hearing for now. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=74.36s)]
*  So what do we know about this plea deal? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=76.52s)]
*  Steve Bannon pled guilty for a conditional discharge. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=80.88s)]
*  So he pled guilty to scheming to defraud in the first degree, which was one of five counts [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=84.72s)]
*  that he was charged with. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=90.42s)]
*  And in exchange, he can't serve as the director of a nonprofit in New York. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=92.16s)]
*  He also can't raise money for charities with assets in the state. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  And an additional aspect to this is that he's not allowed to use any of the donor data, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=101.88s)]
*  because they got hundreds of thousands of donations from hundreds of thousands of people [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=106.6s)]
*  in the scheme. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=112.44s)]
*  So he can't use or sell any of that data, Vlad. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=113.44s)]
*  All right, Katrina Kaufman, Downtown New York City for us. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=117.36s)]
*  Breaking it all down. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=121.44s)]
*  Appreciate it as always, Katrina. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=122.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REACl-KS1nU&t=123.44s)]
