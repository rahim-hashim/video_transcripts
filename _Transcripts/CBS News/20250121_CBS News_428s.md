# Behind Biden's shocking family pardons
**CBS News:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM)
*  This news 24 seven you could call today today delivery day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=0.0s)]
*  That's because it's the first full day of President Donald [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  Trump's presidency and already sweeping moves to deliver on [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=10.56s)]
*  those campaign promises on many fronts. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=14.32s)]
*  So a day of executive orders on immigration, gender and other [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=16.64s)]
*  major issues followed today by a prayer service and cabinet [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=20.6s)]
*  meetings. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=24.6s)]
*  It is go time right now for Donald Trump. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=25.04s)]
*  Well, the president also cleaning house members of the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  Biden administration out along with a morning announcement of [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  a purge of more than 1000 political appointees. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=34.76s)]
*  Trump made a point to name four of them on social media, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=37.96s)]
*  including celebrity chef Jose Andres, who by the way is right [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=41.28s)]
*  now feeding victims of the L.A. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=44.2s)]
*  wildfires and former top general Mark Miley, who testified [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=46.56s)]
*  against Donald Trump and by the way, got a preemptive pardon in [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=50.28s)]
*  the final hours of Joe Biden's presidency. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=53.92s)]
*  So let's go live right now to CBS News chief White House [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=56.559999999999995s)]
*  correspondent and correspondent Major Garrett major a pardons [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=59.4s)]
*  getting the headlines this morning, especially Joe Biden's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=62.16s)]
*  last minute pardons and of course, the pardons for those [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=64.88s)]
*  January six insurrectionists. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=67.8s)]
*  Stay with me here because we want to get your thoughts about [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=69.56s)]
*  what lawmakers told our crews just a minute ago in the halls [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=71.88s)]
*  of Congress and then we'll get your reaction. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=75.36s)]
*  As you should pay attention, this probably won't get [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  reported, but I hope it does. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  And that's the abuse of the abuse of the pardon process by [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=82.60000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=87.2s)]
*  I hope anybody who's going to be critical of what occurred [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=88.64s)]
*  last night is also very critical of a massive overreach [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=91.56s)]
*  by President Biden. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=95.68s)]
*  Perspective pardons kind of like a get out of jail free card [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  makes no sense to me either. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  So to answer your question, maybe we need to go back and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=101.6s)]
*  look at the contours of the authority that future [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=104.84s)]
*  presidents have around pardoning. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=108.08s)]
*  I think Biden is the most massive use of the power that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=112.68s)]
*  we've seen in history. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=117.88s)]
*  And I think you guys probably should not ask the same [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=118.88s)]
*  question. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  So major hearing from Republicans there in response [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=124.64s)]
*  to pardons, it's very clear that they all would like to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=127.36s)]
*  keep the conversation on Joe Biden's pardons rather than [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=130.08s)]
*  Donald Trump's pardons. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  Are you seeing that play out in Washington? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=134.6s)]
*  Certainly in the last minute, Joe Biden pardons are a [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=138.44s)]
*  legitimate news story. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=141.96s)]
*  They are shocking. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=143.24s)]
*  They were shocking as we were approaching the inauguration of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=144.68s)]
*  President Trump to see this last second announcement from [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  the Biden White House about preemptive pardons, even [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=151.44s)]
*  though no investigations have really begun for any of the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=154.8s)]
*  family members named. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=157.56s)]
*  That basically signals to the country that before he left [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  office, President Biden could not express any confidence in [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=162.84s)]
*  due process, the rule of law or any norms of American [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=166.56s)]
*  jurisprudence, because if he did, he would let his family [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=170.56s)]
*  members go through investigations, even if they're [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=174.04s)]
*  charged, have their day in court and follow due process. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=176.48s)]
*  He short circuited all of that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=180.28s)]
*  That is a legitimate news story. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=182.28s)]
*  It is worth inquiring about the range of presidential pardon [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=184.32s)]
*  powers because presidents typically are allowed to pardon [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=187.8s)]
*  for adjudicated crimes, not preemptively for things that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=191.44s)]
*  haven't even been investigated. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=195.36s)]
*  There's one notable exception to that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  That's Gerald Ford pardoning Richard Nixon. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=199.6s)]
*  But everyone knew at the time, right after Watergate, that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=202.48s)]
*  there was a pendency of an indictment of Richard Nixon. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=205.56s)]
*  There had been a full blown public investigation into all [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=208.68s)]
*  this. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=211.68s)]
*  An indictment was coming to pardon family members when [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=212.16s)]
*  there isn't even a full fledged investigation. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=215.32s)]
*  That raises legitimate questions. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=218.04s)]
*  That does not, however, excuse the whitewashing of January 6 [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=220.16s)]
*  and the wholesale pardoning of people who committed acts of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=225.32s)]
*  political violence against law enforcement officers in full [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=228.92s)]
*  public view, were either convicted of those crimes or [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  pled guilty to those crimes, and then to label them political [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  prisoners or hostages in America. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=239.64s)]
*  That's not what they are. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=241.88s)]
*  The pardon powers of President Trump can be applied to them. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=243.28s)]
*  But he is recasting them as somehow victims of the American [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=246.64s)]
*  jurisprudence system when they committed acts of violence in [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=250.24s)]
*  full public view and were either convicted by a jury of their [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=253.48s)]
*  peers or pled guilty. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=256.32s)]
*  Well, and then speaking of those executive orders as they relate [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=258.68s)]
*  to immigration and delivering on the campaign promises of mass [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=261.8s)]
*  deportation, Major, I want to ask you about this. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  People who come to this country and then have children, those [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=268.36s)]
*  children by the Constitution are seen as citizens of the United [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  States. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=273.84s)]
*  Now, the interpretation of that looks to be queuing up for some [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=274.24s)]
*  discussion in our country by way of what Donald Trump has done [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=278.44s)]
*  here. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=280.96s)]
*  Absolutely, Reid. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=283.12s)]
*  You've identified it perfectly. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=284.08s)]
*  The 14th Amendment outlines that if you're born in this country, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=285.76s)]
*  you are a citizen. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=288.59999999999997s)]
*  That is assumed to be a constitutional protection. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=290.12s)]
*  Courts have adjudicated this and have always come down on the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=293.96s)]
*  side of the Constitution and that interpretation of it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=296.96s)]
*  Whether your parents have legal status or not is immaterial. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=300.32s)]
*  Courts have already ruled. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=304.44s)]
*  However, this administration wants to test that again and say, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=306.0s)]
*  know if you're born here and your parents are undocumented, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=309.68s)]
*  you cannot assume citizenship and you can be deported along with [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=313.88s)]
*  those undocumented parents who had you born in this country. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=318.20000000000005s)]
*  You're not shielded from deportation. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=322.52000000000004s)]
*  If you were born here, this administration wants to retest [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  that in court. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  There's precedent on the other side of it, but clearly President [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=328.68s)]
*  Trump is aggressive about this. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=331.92s)]
*  And maybe he believes the Supreme Court as currently [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=334.0s)]
*  constituted with a conservative majority will, if this gets all [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=337.72s)]
*  the way up there, reverse longstanding precedent and [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=340.76000000000005s)]
*  overturn the historic interpretation of the 14th Amendment. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=343.68s)]
*  So speaking to that, and we could almost label our coverage of [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=347.6s)]
*  Donald Trump, will he, won't he, can he, can't he sort of lens [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  and perspective here. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=354.6s)]
*  Let's talk about the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=355.56s)]
*  He said he would. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=359.68s)]
*  Now he's saying he will. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=360.84000000000003s)]
*  But can he, can he and will it be recognized by other nations? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=362.56s)]
*  There's that big question today as well. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=366.04s)]
*  Mexico's already said it will not recognize that it will be the Gulf of [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=369.6s)]
*  Mexico to the Mexican government. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=372.36s)]
*  It will probably be the Gulf of Mexico to others who refer to it on their maps. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=374.52s)]
*  There is a process, Ed O'Keefe, my colleague here in Washington with CBS News, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=379.16s)]
*  knows a great deal about the finer contours of the federal bureaucracy. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=384.88s)]
*  He used to cover that when he was at the Washington Post and he told us yesterday [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=389.48s)]
*  that there is a somewhat obscure bureau that has a process for the application of names. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcK3XFsZyjM&t=393.28000000000003s)]
