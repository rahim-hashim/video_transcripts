# Laken Riley Act heads to Trump's desk for signature
**CBS News:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY)
*  Welcome back to America Decides. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=0.0s)]
*  The House of Representatives moments ago passed the Lincoln-Reilly Act. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=1.68s)]
*  This will expand federal authorities and powers to detain those undocumented immigrants suspected [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=5.48s)]
*  of any manner of crimes committed in this country. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=11.76s)]
*  The vote was 263 to 156. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=15.58s)]
*  We discussed this earlier with Scott McFarland. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  He suggested there might be some number of House Democrats to join onto this legislation. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=19.84s)]
*  That number in the end, 46 House Democrats voted in favor of the Lincoln-Reilly Act. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  This bill now heads to President Trump for his signature, which will be forthcoming in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=29.48s)]
*  a matter of days and be the first piece of legislation signed in Trump 2.0. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=34.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, Speaker Mike Johnson defending President Trump's broad grant of clemency [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=39.84s)]
*  to the January 6th rioters. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=44.38s)]
*  We want to show you what Johnson said alongside what actually happened just over four years [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=46.46s)]
*  ago. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=51.68s)]
*  Everybody can describe this however they want. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=53.56s)]
*  The president has the pardon and commutation authority. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=55.46s)]
*  It's his decision. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=59.28s)]
*  I think what was made clear all along is that peaceful protests and people who engage in [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  that should never be punished. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=66.24s)]
*  It was a weaponization of the Justice Department. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  Molly Ball and Shelby Talcott are here with me now at the table. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=72.08s)]
*  Molly, a senior political correspondent for The Wall Street Journal. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=74.8s)]
*  Shelby, White House correspondent for Semaphore. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=77.0s)]
*  Very quickly, Molly, the Lincoln-Reilly Act, there will be a signing ceremony at the White [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=80.68s)]
*  House. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  Senate Democrats did not allow this to come to the floor before the election. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=86.48s)]
*  They did this time. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=89.64s)]
*  They amended it slightly, but it's on its way to President Trump's desk. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=90.64s)]
*  Elections have consequences. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=94.12s)]
*  Indeed they do. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=95.12s)]
*  And it's very clear. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=96.12s)]
*  I mean, we reported today on a letter that many of the Democrats in the Senate sent to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=97.12s)]
*  Republican leadership saying they want to continue to work together on immigration. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  There's a clear sense that Democrats have gotten the message from the electorate that [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  they want something done on immigration. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  That being said, there's still quite a lot of unease within the Democratic caucus about [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=110.5s)]
*  how far to go, given that something like this started as a messaging bill and has a lot [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  of provisions that Democrats remain uneasy with. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=120.24s)]
*  And I think they're all waiting to see what the Trump administration does on the executive [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=123.55999999999999s)]
*  level with immigration, how far they go, and whether there's any kind of public backlash [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=128.4s)]
*  to it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  Shelby, the administration is going quite a distance toward overhauling not only the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=134.35999999999999s)]
*  application of immigration laws, but the very definition of what it means to seek asylum [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=139.84s)]
*  in this country, to arrive at our gates as a refugee or seeking refugee status, and the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=144.76s)]
*  deployment of the U.S. military. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=149.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=151.16s)]
*  And I think this is a situation where they're most certainly going to see legal pushback [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=152.16s)]
*  on a variety of these executive orders that we've seen drop in the last day and a half. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=155.72s)]
*  But this is what Donald Trump campaigned on. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=160.54s)]
*  He campaigned on the economy and on immigration. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=162.84s)]
*  Those were his two top issues. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=166.14s)]
*  And he made pretty clear what he was going to do on day one. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=167.76s)]
*  Throughout the past few months when I've talked to transition officials, they've made very [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=171.24s)]
*  clear that this has been their goal. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=175.16s)]
*  And so I think particularly when it comes to immigration, this has been no secret that [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=176.68s)]
*  this is what Donald Trump wants to do. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=181.6s)]
*  He's gone into office and he's doing exactly what he said he was going to. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=183.12s)]
*  And Molly, just to put a legal button on this, it is the assumption of the Trump administration [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=186.08s)]
*  it will fight these legal battles and it wants some of them to get to the Supreme Court because [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=191.16s)]
*  it believes it will get a favorable interpretation. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=195.02s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=198.52s)]
*  And we'll see. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=199.52s)]
*  That's their assumption. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm not saying that's what's going to happen, but that's their initial assumption. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=202.04000000000002s)]
*  Or at the very least that they win politically from the fight, from, as Shelby said, appearing [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=206.04000000000002s)]
*  to be pushing as hard as possible to make good on those campaign promises to the fullest [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=210.0s)]
*  extent that they possibly can. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=215.84s)]
*  Now, many of the things that Trump tried to do on immigration in his first term were stopped [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  in the courts. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=222.04000000000002s)]
*  And we don't see any letup in the willingness of outside organizations to bring lawsuits [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  against these types of actions. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=228.68s)]
*  So is the Supreme Court majority now more favorable to Donald Trump when it comes to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  something where there's a great deal of precedent, like, say, the attempt to overturn birthright [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=236.64s)]
*  citizenship? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=242.44s)]
*  We'll have to see because that is something on which the courts have been quite consistent [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=244.04s)]
*  for a very long time. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=247.28s)]
*  Shelby also moves by the Trump administration to overhaul, if it can, certainly reimagine [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=248.6s)]
*  the size scope of the federal workforce, specifically as it relates to diversity, equity, and inclusion. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=255.18s)]
*  Yeah, they have signed an executive order getting rid of diversity, equity, and inclusion, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=260.18s)]
*  and they actually sent agency heads last night a letter saying, here's a sample of what you [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=264.65999999999997s)]
*  should be sending out to these people who have these jobs. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=270.42s)]
*  We're getting rid of these jobs. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=274.82s)]
*  And they've also initiated a warning saying if any of these agencies are trying to sort [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=276.18s)]
*  of get DEI to remain under a different name, you have to tell us. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=282.94s)]
*  So there's a lot going on with that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=287.7s)]
*  But again, this is another thing that Donald Trump campaigned on. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=289.34s)]
*  And I think in the past day and a half, what we've learned is what Donald Trump has campaigned [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=292.4s)]
*  on is what he is doing in the first few days of his administration. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=296.78s)]
*  Everything he said he was going to do, pardon the January 6 rioters, get rid of DEI, try [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=301.54s)]
*  to shrink the scope of the government. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  He's trying to do all of that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=309.3s)]
*  Molly, you wrote vividly, as you so often do, about the inauguration inside the Capitol [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=310.70000000000005s)]
*  Rotunda, the arrangement of billionaires, tech and otherwise, right next to the rostrum. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=315.54s)]
*  And yet, there was an announcement at the White House yesterday about Stargate, supposedly [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=322.90000000000003s)]
*  $500 billion to be invested in data centers and the power required to fuel them to move [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=327.18s)]
*  artificial intelligence development way forward in this country. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=334.3s)]
*  So hours later, Elon Musk throws cold water all over that on X saying they don't have [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=338.1s)]
*  the money, they don't have the resources. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=344.1s)]
*  And that seems to me a kind of dividing line. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=346.86s)]
*  We're already seeing tensions break out over Elon Musk's role and exactly what it is he's [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=350.70000000000005s)]
*  empowered to do. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=357.34000000000003s)]
*  If all he's doing is taking pot shots on social media and he's not using governmental authority. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=358.34000000000003s)]
*  And reigning on a presidential parade. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=364.18s)]
*  Sure, but he didn't have the power, for example, to stop that announcement from being made [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=365.98s)]
*  or to undo it in any material way that we have seen so far. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=369.74s)]
*  He's expressing skepticism about it essentially as a private citizen. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=373.38s)]
*  So as much as there are tensions, you know, within the White House and in the larger Trump [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=377.14s)]
*  movement over the things Elon wants to do and some suspicion about to what extent he [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=381.86s)]
*  may have vested interests at stake as well, given that he himself has an AI company, you [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=386.34s)]
*  know, I think a lot is going to depend. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=392.58s)]
*  And it's going to be a very outstanding rivalry with Sam Altman, who was in the Roosevelt [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=393.62s)]
*  room last evening. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=396.3s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=397.53999999999996s)]
*  And with many of those other tech billionaires who were in the rotunda for the swearing in. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=398.53999999999996s)]
*  So I think a lot is going to depend on what he can actually do versus what he's just out [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=401.94s)]
*  there popping off about. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=406.97999999999996s)]
*  And Shelby, this also factors in and filters through the Department of Government Efficiency, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=408.09999999999997s)]
*  which is now within the Eisenhower executive office building right across the street from [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=413.94s)]
*  the White House, occupying what used to be the U.S. Digital Services bureaucracy, which [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=418.46s)]
*  means it's actually a real thing. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=423.44s)]
*  It's got an office, got staff, and it's going to be run entirely by Elon. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=425.71999999999997s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy on the way out. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=429.12s)]
*  And this was really interesting because they were able to this is how they were able to [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=431.64s)]
*  sort of do this to by essentially taking this existing agency and just putting a new name [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=434.84s)]
*  on it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=441.42s)]
*  But what's really notable is we have a lot of questions that remain when it comes to [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=442.42s)]
*  Doge because the executive order really focused on expanding and improving the technology [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=445.9s)]
*  of the government, whereas the initial mission of Doge, of course, was to drastically save [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=452.5s)]
*  money and shrink the U.S. government. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=459.02s)]
*  And then you have Elon Musk, who has a room in the White House who has a building, an [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=461.65999999999997s)]
*  office space there, but he's not actually a White House official. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=468.18s)]
*  And so there are a lot of questions that remain on on how this is going to work and what exactly [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=471.85999999999996s)]
*  Doge is going to ultimately be responsible for doing. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=476.64s)]
*  What somebody like Elon Musk might learn about a very extensive access to the inner workings [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=479.26s)]
*  of the federal technology apparatus. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=484.26s)]
*  Yes, he could use that in all sorts of ways, maybe to help the U.S. taxpayer, maybe to [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=486.62s)]
*  help Elon Musk and his widespread industrial technological footprint. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=491.41999999999996s)]
*  Yep. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=497.26s)]
*  And I will say a quick way, though, to get out of Donald Trump's favor is to do something [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=498.26s)]
*  like tweet about an initiative that Donald Trump has been touting and sort of pour cold [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=501.97999999999996s)]
*  water on it. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=507.76s)]
*  And, you know, who knows if if Donald Trump will take that seriously. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=508.76s)]
*  But generally, historically, that's not the smartest thing to do. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=511.92s)]
*  But as that saying goes, watch this space. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=515.92s)]
*  Shelby Taukat, Molly Wall. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=518.04s)]
*  Thanks so much, as always. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY96vnYywHY&t=519.48s)]
