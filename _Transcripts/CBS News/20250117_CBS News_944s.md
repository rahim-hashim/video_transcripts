# Supreme Court upholds TikTok ban, app could go dark Sunday if it remains under Chinese ownership
**CBS News:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M)
*  All right, we've got this information for you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=0.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court just ruled this is on the significance of a potential ban of TikTok. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=5.28s)]
*  We have all the information coming in. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=12.64s)]
*  I understand the decision has just dropped. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=14.84s)]
*  Our teams are reading through it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=17.64s)]
*  We've got CBS News Money Watch correspondent, Kelly O'Grady, here with us. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=18.92s)]
*  You're just seeing this for the first moment as well. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=23.44s)]
*  This is early information. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=25.86s)]
*  What do we know? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=27.28s)]
*  Yes, so just reading through this now, we do know that the Supreme Court has ruled to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=28.36s)]
*  uphold the ban, uphold the law, right? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  So there was a big challenge that whether this was unconstitutional, whether it violated [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=35.4s)]
*  free speech, right now the Supreme Court has decided that this law can stand. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=39.78s)]
*  And of course, now it's going to be a question of what goes on once the president-elect takes [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  office because the Biden administration reportedly may not enforce the ban. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=50.52s)]
*  But we do know that the Supreme Court has ruled that the ban is okay to be upheld. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=54.94s)]
*  So the Supreme Court not jumping in here to save the day for TikTok. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=58.32s)]
*  The small business owners and content creators won't be happy to hear this because the platform [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=62.96s)]
*  they've used to grow a following, to earn money potentially, will now be banned. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=68.8s)]
*  Sunday, as you mentioned, President Biden said he won't intervene to get in the way [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  of this. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=77.76s)]
*  But President-elect Trump has seen the benefit of TikTok. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=78.76s)]
*  He's credited the platform with helping him get into the White House. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=81.28s)]
*  So what does this mean in the very short term for all of these people on the platform [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=84.36s)]
*  who don't know what will happen come Sunday and Monday? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=88.74s)]
*  Okay, so a couple of things. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=91.52s)]
*  In the most immediate short term, the law says that come Sunday, Apple, Google, these [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=93.44s)]
*  app stores, they cannot have the app in their app stores for those in the U.S. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  So if you don't have TikTok on your phone, you're not going to be able to download it [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=104.08s)]
*  come Sunday. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=108.8s)]
*  Now, TikTok is reportedly considering not just, okay, we'll still allow people who [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=109.8s)]
*  are using the app to have access to it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=115.56s)]
*  They are reportedly considering completely shutting down access for all users. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=117.56s)]
*  So that's sort of the first question of what might come Sunday for those of us that do [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=121.82s)]
*  have the app on our phones. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=125.72s)]
*  Then you take this out a little bit further. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=128.04s)]
*  There's the question of would President-elect Trump sign an executive order that would roll [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=130.88s)]
*  back this law? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=135.96s)]
*  There's a lot of legal questions for those that are far more smart in that world than [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=137.14s)]
*  me to answer whether that would be possible. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=141.14s)]
*  But the broader picture is people who use this for their business, for their brand. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=143.57999999999998s)]
*  I've talked to many of them. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=148.77999999999997s)]
*  They're pretty worried because TikTok versus Instagram, you have different audiences there. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=149.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=154.45999999999998s)]
*  President Trump being sworn in noon Monday. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=155.45999999999998s)]
*  So if this could be part of his first few official acts, it's still unfolding. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=158.42s)]
*  Kelly O'Grady, thank you so much. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=164.17999999999998s)]
*  Let's also bring in CBS News legal contributor, Caroline Polisi. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=166.06s)]
*  How much, tell us what you know about the Supreme Court's decisions so far and what [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=170.74s)]
*  this means for people who truly do rely on the app right now. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=176.66s)]
*  Yeah, well, it literally just dropped. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=180.3s)]
*  I would say from what I've skimmed through, it's not surprising. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=182.9s)]
*  The First Amendment arguments here on behalf of TikTok really weren't that strong. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=186.98000000000002s)]
*  We're calling it the TikTok ban, but really what this was, was a bipartisan supported [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=193.14s)]
*  legislation that Congress passed about corporate structures, really, to preserve national security. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=198.94s)]
*  And it relates to ByteDance, the parent company that owns TikTok. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=206.85999999999999s)]
*  And essentially, the argument was that the ban would violate free speech, free speech [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=210.98s)]
*  implications, but the First Amendment can take a back seat to other certain issues. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=217.42s)]
*  And in this case, it's national security. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=223.57999999999998s)]
*  The concern is that China may be stealing our data, spying on us, all the things that [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=225.38s)]
*  we've heard. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=231.57999999999998s)]
*  You just reported what could happen. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=233.46s)]
*  Trump, I mean, this bill was spurred because in Trump's first term, he wanted to sign an [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=236.74s)]
*  executive order getting rid of TikTok. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=242.57999999999998s)]
*  And so that raised sort of Congress's eyebrows and got this issue on the table. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=244.74s)]
*  So this idea that Trump could potentially sign an executive order and sort of wave a [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=251.42000000000002s)]
*  magic wand is not legally accurate. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=257.62s)]
*  Right. So you can't just sign an executive order and make congressional legislation go [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=262.5s)]
*  away. It could be a sort of bandaid. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=267.06s)]
*  He could say, you know, we're extending implementation of the law for 30 to 60 days [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=270.5s)]
*  while we give ByteDance the chance to divest the TikTok company to an American-owned [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=277.66s)]
*  company, which is what the law says. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=286.22s)]
*  Essentially, TikTok would have to sell to an American-owned company. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=288.66s)]
*  There's been a lot of sort of whisperings about potentially Elon Musk stepping in to [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=292.54s)]
*  buy the company. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=297.62s)]
*  But ByteDance says that's pure fiction. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=299.78000000000003s)]
*  They clearly don't want to sell. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=302.46s)]
*  So, you know, there's a lot of legal implications here. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=304.82s)]
*  As noted, he could just direct his Justice Department, Trump, not to enforce the ban. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=308.26s)]
*  But, you know, if I'm the general counsel at Apple or Google that's selling this app, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=314.06s)]
*  I wouldn't be too comfortable continuing to market and sell and provide TikTok to users, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=320.98s)]
*  even in the face of Trump saying he wouldn't move forward with implementing, you know, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=329.94s)]
*  enforcing it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=334.98s)]
*  I mean, it's fascinating for you to lay out the potential options for the incoming president, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=335.98s)]
*  president-elect Trump, because all of a sudden his inauguration Monday carries with it two [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=342.82s)]
*  significant developments from the hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=348.22s)]
*  And now Trump has a decision to make on what to do for TikTok. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=352.86s)]
*  I understand that in addition to Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and other tech [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=358.46000000000004s)]
*  billionaires that the CEO of TikTok's U.S. subsidiary is expected to be at inauguration. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=364.74s)]
*  So before we let you go, help me understand the options that Trump has, either in what [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=372.02000000000004s)]
*  he can do or what he can encourage his Republican majorities in Congress to do. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=377.94s)]
*  For example, there's been a suggestion to propose an additional delay somehow of the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=381.82s)]
*  bill. What options are on the table? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=386.5s)]
*  Yeah. And I would note the CEO is not only invited to the inauguration, but apparently [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=388.02s)]
*  he will be seated very prominently close to sort of sort of prime time, which I think [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=392.78s)]
*  tells you a lot. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=398.9s)]
*  That's a very significant detail. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=399.9s)]
*  It is. It is. And, you know, Trump has been very outspoken in wanting to save TikTok. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=401.46s)]
*  He sees it as a place where people like him. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=407.66s)]
*  He's been very outspoken about this. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=411.34000000000003s)]
*  He submitted a brief in the Supreme Court case when he was not even a party to it, saying [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=413.34000000000003s)]
*  basically he's the only person that has sort of the political power, mandate and business [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=420.7s)]
*  acumen to deal with the issue. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=425.46s)]
*  But, you know, it's not that easy, unfortunately. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=427.98s)]
*  I think the easiest way out instead of it's kind of hard to overturn legislation, he would [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=432.58000000000004s)]
*  have to really push a bipartisan effort. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=439.06s)]
*  And, you know, it takes time. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=443.42s)]
*  It's not it's not again, you can't wave a magic wand. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=445.26000000000005s)]
*  I think the easier path would be to try to find an extension of implementation of the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=447.58000000000004s)]
*  ban and try to find a buyer. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=453.42s)]
*  But again, that is contingent on for whatever reason, it seems pretty clear by dance doesn't [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=455.14000000000004s)]
*  want to sell to an American buyer, even though, you know, they stand to make billions of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=460.78s)]
*  dollars on this entity. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=467.58s)]
*  And you have to ask yourself why. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=469.17999999999995s)]
*  At the very least, all the people who use this app are likely freaking out at the moment [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=472.53999999999996s)]
*  because the TikTok they've used for so long is effectively coming to an end. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=477.5s)]
*  Caroline Polisi, we really appreciate your insight. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=482.9s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=484.94s)]
*  We want to quickly cross over now to CBS News senior White House correspondent, Weijia [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=486.46s)]
*  Zhang. Weijia, this decision just handed down by the Supreme Court. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=490.3s)]
*  What's the latest from the Biden administration? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=493.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, the Biden administration has not responded directly to the Supreme Court decision. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=497.42s)]
*  However, Errol, it has issued a statement to make clear that it will not be the Biden [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=503.62s)]
*  administration that is implementing the law that goes into effect on Sunday. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=508.26s)]
*  Now, as Caroline laid out, this was bipartisan legislation. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=513.46s)]
*  But to be clear, President Biden signed it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=516.58s)]
*  So it is the law of the land. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=519.58s)]
*  And even though there may be an option to pause on implementing for 90 days, that is an [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=522.1s)]
*  exemption only if there is active conversations and movement in a potential sale. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=530.46s)]
*  But as Caroline also said, and this is really important, there that doesn't exist. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=538.38s)]
*  ByteDance has made very clear they do not have any intention of selling. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=542.86s)]
*  So as far as what the White House is saying now, they're saying our position on this has [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=546.34s)]
*  been clear. TikTok should continue to operate, but under American ownership. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=550.94s)]
*  Again, that doesn't seem like it's happening anytime soon. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=556.5s)]
*  It goes on to say, given the timing of when it goes into effect over a holiday weekend, a day [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=560.38s)]
*  before inauguration, it will be up to the next administration to implement. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=566.5s)]
*  So the message from here is, you know, we're we're on our way out. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=571.7s)]
*  We're gone. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=575.5400000000001s)]
*  So it's up to President-elect Trump and his team to do something about making sure the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=576.2199999999999s)]
*  law is carried out. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=581.9s)]
*  Now, it is important to note that the incoming national security adviser, Mike Waltz, did [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=583.5799999999999s)]
*  have an interview just a few days ago. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=589.7399999999999s)]
*  And during that, he said, we will put measures in place to keep TikTok from going dark. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=592.38s)]
*  But there aren't that many options that they have on the table right now, Errol. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=598.0999999999999s)]
*  So it will be interesting to see what they might propose. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=602.38s)]
*  But what actually happens is that at some point they're going to have to implement the law of [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=605.22s)]
*  the land, which is a ban on TikTok in the U.S. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=610.22s)]
*  Yeah. And we just help us understand, especially for those who are likely making some content for [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=613.98s)]
*  TikTok right now, why this app was considered so dangerous by Congress when our Facebook's, our [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=619.62s)]
*  X platforms and others also gather our data, listen to microphones, perhaps watch through our [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=626.3399999999999s)]
*  cameras just as much as as any other apps. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=633.06s)]
*  Why was TikTok specifically seen as such a specific national security threat by the by [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=636.0999999999999s)]
*  D.C.? Errol, this is such a critical question. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=642.0999999999999s)]
*  And I really do think that, you know, as we have the conversations about how people use and [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=645.5799999999999s)]
*  rely on TikTok for their livelihoods, the question is at what cost. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=651.3s)]
*  Right. And the reason why this was passed is because lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=657.42s)]
*  really worried that because of the Chinese involvement here, the parent company [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=662.5s)]
*  ByteDance affiliated with China, that the government, that the Chinese government [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=668.18s)]
*  could be receiving data about the millions and millions of Americans [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=673.98s)]
*  who use this platform. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=682.14s)]
*  That's why it's different, because when you're talking about Metta, when you're talking about, you know, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=684.02s)]
*  X, these are American companies. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=689.58s)]
*  And so when you have a U.S. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=692.74s)]
*  adversary that is potentially collecting all this critical data on American citizens, then, of [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=695.86s)]
*  course, it is a much different story, which is precisely why lawmakers passed this bill to begin with. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=702.6999999999999s)]
*  And I think that, you know, that is the question that national security experts continue to pose, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=708.9399999999999s)]
*  which is at what cost are you willing to give up your data? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=715.38s)]
*  But we have seen and you have reported on this wave of TikTok users making the decision to [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=719.78s)]
*  download and use a Chinese government owned app called Red Little Book, I believe. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=728.9s)]
*  And so they're sort of protesting and saying, you know, it's worth it to us. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=736.14s)]
*  We have done the risk benefit assessment and for us, it is worth it to have another government know [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=740.14s)]
*  whatever they can glean on, you know, what content we choose to look at on TikTok. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=747.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you're so right about that. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=752.78s)]
*  There's national security components, tech components, but there's so much emotion felt by its users. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=754.06s)]
*  They seem very attached to this platform for so many reasons. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=759.54s)]
*  Weijia Jiang giving us the latest there from the White House. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=763.06s)]
*  I want to now cross back with CBS News Money Watch correspondent Kelly O'Grady, who is still here with us. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=766.26s)]
*  For some who may be older, they look at this platform as something that the kids can dance on. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=771.14s)]
*  But you know full well from your reporting that for many of its users, it's so much more serious than that. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=776.74s)]
*  It is. And in fact, I interviewed a family of folks who are from Nashville and they were living on teacher salaries before [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=783.9s)]
*  they started on TikTok. They started making, you know, family friendly comedy videos and they now make a living from this. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=791.9s)]
*  And so I kind of pressed them. I was like, well, why TikTok versus an Instagram or a Snap or some of these other apps? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=798.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, why is this different? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=804.38s)]
*  Exactly. So what they said to me was, look, the the editing tools, the creator tools that TikTok offers [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=805.58s)]
*  are far more advanced, far more easy to use than what they've seen on Instagram. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=812.7s)]
*  They actually edit all of their videos on TikTok. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=817.82s)]
*  And the other thing is the algorithm. They're able to reach for some reason a lot more people. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=820.38s)]
*  And she one of the girls showed me a number of videos. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=826.82s)]
*  She said, you know, this one, I posted the exact same video on TikTok and then on Instagram. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=829.3000000000001s)]
*  It got over a million views on TikTok and then on Instagram, it only got a couple hundred thousand. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=833.7s)]
*  Same content. Yeah. And there were tons of examples of that. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=838.4200000000001s)]
*  And so that's the sort of the crux of it, that people find this really, really beneficial for their income, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=841.9s)]
*  whether it's full time or supplemental. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=848.18s)]
*  And TikTok also made it very easy for people to sell products, get a commission, a whole other component that Instagram was slower to develop. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=850.1s)]
*  This is uncharted territory to some extent for the US, but this did happen in India. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=858.8199999999999s)]
*  How might that help us look at what might happen next? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=863.14s)]
*  It's a great case study of what could happen. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=866.3399999999999s)]
*  So India saw this ahead of time and they said, look, we're going to ban this app. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=868.66s)]
*  This goes back to summer of 2020. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=873.38s)]
*  And the big benefitter was Instagram. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=875.3s)]
*  It blew up in the country. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=878.38s)]
*  So many users flocked to Instagram. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=880.46s)]
*  And what was interesting to see happen is there was a bifurcation of who succeeded on the platform. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=882.26s)]
*  So people that already had big names, lots of followers, it was a snowballing effect when they moved over to Instagram. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=887.86s)]
*  But kind of those smaller creators, I mean, more followers than I have, Errol, but those with a million and whatnot are still considered small. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=895.06s)]
*  They really struggled to gain traction in India. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=903.9s)]
*  And so that's kind of potentially something that could happen if there's no solution when it comes to buyers or delays with the next incoming administration. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=907.38s)]
*  You could see those smaller businesses, smaller influencers try and get that same traction on these other apps and maybe not succeed as much. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=916.3s)]
*  Yeah. And it's a wake up call that this impacts people's lives, people with middle, low income, some people who are unemployed. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=924.9399999999999s)]
*  They have been relying on this platform and the creativity that it provides. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=931.02s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=935.6999999999999s)]
*  My thanks to Caroline Kelly Weijer. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=937.0999999999999s)]
*  We will have more continuing coverage on the Supreme Court decision in just a few moments. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=938.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc4sBQfVi1M&t=942.9399999999999s)]
