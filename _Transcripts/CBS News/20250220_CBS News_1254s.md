# New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announces new limits on Eric Adams' power
**CBS News:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0)
*  We want to take you now to CBS News New York's local coverage of Governor Kathy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=0.0s)]
*  Hockel's announcement regarding New York City Mayor Eric Adams. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=4.1s)]
*  Not a king, not a queen, and not a governor should prevail. Voters determine [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  who they want or they do not want to represent them in elective office. As I [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=16.82s)]
*  said last week, I was deeply troubled by the accusations leveled at Mayor Eric [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=24.12s)]
*  Adams, not just the initial indictment but also the more recent allegation of a [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  quid pro quo with the Trump administration. For days I've been deeply [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=35.32s)]
*  involved in discussions with my closest advisors, city leaders, electeds, clergy, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=41.28s)]
*  business, labor, civic leaders, all people whose opinions matter to me [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=47.72s)]
*  because they care about our city. I consulted them and legal advisors on whether [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=52.56s)]
*  it's appropriate and necessary at this moment. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  I've also heard from many voices of New Yorkers who feel outraged, who feel hurt, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=65.2s)]
*  betrayed by what they have seen. And I want those New Yorkers to know I [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=70.12s)]
*  understand those feelings as well. After careful consideration, I was able to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=76.36s)]
*  come to the conclusion that I was wrong. I was wrong. I was wrong. I was wrong. I [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=83.0s)]
*  I understand those feelings as well. After careful consideration, I have determined that I will not commence removal proceedings at this time. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=89.08s)]
*  My strong belief is that the will of the voters and the supremacy and sanctity of democratic [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=101.88s)]
*  elections preclude me from any other action. I cannot deny the people of this great city [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=108.32s)]
*  the power to make this decision for themselves. And to those who conclude that this decision [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=115.64s)]
*  is due to pressure from any groups or individuals, I say this. You do not know me. Constant pressure [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=122.08s)]
*  is what I deal with all day long. And it's absolutely no bearing on any decisions I make. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=133.56s)]
*  I will say this. I also have concerns about disruption and chaos that such a move, such [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=141.88s)]
*  a proceeding could bring to the residents of this great city. And those who argue just [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=148.48s)]
*  go and remove them fail to appreciate there is a process involved, due process, the length [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  of the process, and the impact that such a process would have on this city. And actually [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=160.68s)]
*  with the timing, it's not impossible that we'd have a scenario where there's multiple [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=167.56s)]
*  mayors of this city in the course of one year. But make no mistake, the current situation [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=172.16s)]
*  is one that I take very seriously. That's why I want to spell out my immediate objectives. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=180.44s)]
*  Number one, to stabilize this city and restore calm. Number two, ensure that all services [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=186.68s)]
*  for our residents continue without disruption. And three, to take steps to make sure our [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=195.56s)]
*  leaders are operating only with the city's best interests in mind, unimpeded by any legal [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=203.36s)]
*  agreements with the Trump Justice Department. I want to be very clear. There are past examples [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=209.68s)]
*  of coordination and cooperation between the federal government, the city, the state. It's [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  not uncommon. But there's a clear line between cooperation and coercion. Given how aggressive [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=222.12s)]
*  the Trump administration has been, including its attempt yesterday to dismantle a previously [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=229.76s)]
*  approved congestion pricing program and how deeply disturbing the comments from the president's [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=236.36s)]
*  were, we know they'll stop at nothing to try and exercise control over New York. That is [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=245.04s)]
*  the fight we had yesterday. That is the fight we have today. And that is the fight I'm willing [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=253.88s)]
*  to take on for the next 1,430 days. To move this city forward, I'm undertaking the implementation [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=260.48s)]
*  of certain guardrails that I believe are a first start in reestablishing trust for New [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=268.16s)]
*  York City residents. And ensure that all decisions out of City Hall are in the clear interests [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=274.0s)]
*  of the people of this city and not at the behest of the president. I'm proposing three [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=280.24s)]
*  immediate actions which I believe will help protect New Yorkers. First, I'm proposing [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=285.92s)]
*  legislation to create a special inspector general for New York City Affairs within the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=291.6s)]
*  office of the state inspector general. The state inspector general will be able to direct [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=297.24s)]
*  the New York City Department of Investigations. And the mayor will only be able to move the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=302.2s)]
*  department investigations commissioner with the approval of the state inspector general. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=307.24s)]
*  This will protect the city's investigations from any interference. Make sure that there's [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=313.22s)]
*  no lack of independence as they make their determinations. And allow the inspector general [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=318.26s)]
*  to focus more directly on any improper activity that may arise out of New York City. They'll [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=324.96s)]
*  also give reports to us. We'll have access to information. Second, I'm proposing giving [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=329.96s)]
*  the city controller, the public advocate, and the New York City Council speaker an independent [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=335.47999999999996s)]
*  authority to clarify the independent language to commence litigation against the federal [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=342.4s)]
*  government when necessary and using outside counsel. The city's law department will still [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=348.17999999999995s)]
*  have the opportunity to initiate legal actions within seven days of any request. But the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=354.12s)]
*  whole of city government should not be reliant on city hall for legal cases where the people [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=359.12s)]
*  of the city may be under attack by the federal government. Third, I'm expanding funding for [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  the office of the deputy state controller general, controller for city oversight. Because [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=372.36s)]
*  this stepped up oversight, again, gives us an independent line of sight into potential [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=378.32s)]
*  decisions related to the federal government. This will be paid for by city receipts. Once [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=383.24s)]
*  these measures are enacted, they'll be effective immediately and expire at the end of 2025, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=390.04s)]
*  subject to renewal. I've already discussed these proposals with the city council speaker [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=396.04s)]
*  and the speaker of the state assembly and the major leader of the New York State Senate. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=401.8s)]
*  I also told the mayor that strong managers need to be identified to fill the roles of [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=410.24s)]
*  the deputy mayors before they become vacant and that we and my administration, with strong [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=414.8s)]
*  relationships that we have, will work to accomplish that goal and do whatever he can to keep his [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=420.28000000000003s)]
*  key commissioners. I want to take a moment to put this all in context. New York is facing [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=426.66s)]
*  a grave threat from Washington. The Trump administration, as I said, is already trying [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=434.52s)]
*  to use the legal jeopardy facing our mayor, is leveraged to squeeze and punish our city. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=439.36s)]
*  The president's already trying to weaken our public transit system and undermine our state [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=445.6s)]
*  sovereignty. I call it the Trump revenge tour, and I have to stand in its way. Not surprising, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=450.48s)]
*  he's taking out his anger and frustration over the 35 felony convictions he received [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=459.96000000000004s)]
*  taken out on our own New Yorkers. And as governor, I will be the vanguard against harm to our [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=465.66s)]
*  state and our people. And nothing will stand in our way. But once I have made a decision, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=472.34000000000003s)]
*  I execute it, I make it work hard to make it work. My decision today did not come lightly, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=479.74s)]
*  but the path forward for me is clear. I will retain the powers conferred upon me by the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=487.0s)]
*  New York state constitution, the city chowder, but it is my sincere hope that these dark [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=492.74s)]
*  days will pass, elections will occur, and the people of New York will decide who they [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=497.74s)]
*  trust to govern this extraordinary city. And we can remain laser focused and united against [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=503.36s)]
*  the storm clouds that are swirling 226 miles away in our nation's capital. My eyes are [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=510.42s)]
*  on the city, the state, and on Washington. And I'm ready and prepared to take on any [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=517.06s)]
*  fight against any threats to the well-being of our residents. Any questions? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=522.9399999999999s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. We're going to do this in an orderly way. Let's start right here [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=529.94s)]
*  in front. You talked about the will of the people. The will of the people may be the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=536.94s)]
*  power to remove Adams. It seems like a little bit of an awkward workaround to use the power [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=541.94s)]
*  that the people have already given you. So you're saying it's better to ignore the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=546.94s)]
*  provisions in our constitution that call for free and fair elections? Can you just walk [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=554.3800000000001s)]
*  out of my listeners? No, we have elections in our country and in our state. It's what [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=558.54s)]
*  separates us out from places where they do actually have kings and dictators. This is [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=563.3s)]
*  something I take very seriously. And it is up to the voters of this great city to determine [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=568.18s)]
*  who they want to continue as their leader or bring in a new leader. It is up to them. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=573.38s)]
*  That is a sacred right that they have, and I will not deny them that. Ben? It sounds [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=578.38s)]
*  like you've spoken to the mayor. Are you confident he'll choose experienced professionals [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=584.38s)]
*  as opposed to sort of combative loyalists like Kaz Gautry, who we've reported is up [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=591.38s)]
*  to the deputy mayor of public safety? If you could all characterize your conversations [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=595.38s)]
*  with him, what did he say? How did he feel about these proposed changes? You can ask [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=601.38s)]
*  him how he feels about these proposed changes, but I explained that this is an opportunity [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=606.38s)]
*  to install safeguards that we need to have in place to give people confidence that there's [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=611.38s)]
*  only one factor in every decision that's made and that's what's best for the people [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=618.38s)]
*  of the city. And he has to earn that. And there's an opportunity to do that. I also [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=623.38s)]
*  have a strong team here. They have incredibly tight relationships with the mayor's team. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=628.38s)]
*  And that constant communication is part of why there's, was a stabilization of the situation [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=634.38s)]
*  last fall and why that's what we're shooting for right now. So he's offered to work with [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=640.38s)]
*  us if we have recommendations on people, et cetera. But I want to make sure that we, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=646.38s)]
*  sure that the commissioners stay as well. Have you recorded that? It's early. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=651.38s)]
*  Governor, so do you think that the mayor should resign on his own and if not, do you think [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=656.38s)]
*  he has lost the ability to govern? It is up to an individual to decide if they want to [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=662.38s)]
*  remove, leave from office at any time. You don't think he should? I'm, no, you did not phrase [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=667.38s)]
*  my answer correctly. It is not up to me to tell them to leave. It is up to an individual [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=672.38s)]
*  if they want to resign the office to which they've been elected. Do you think that he's lost the ability to govern? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=677.38s)]
*  I am working to put in safeguards to restore the trust that is necessary to get this city [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=682.38s)]
*  back focused out of all this controversy and get people in New York City what they want. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=688.38s)]
*  They just want normalcy again. And that's what I'm fighting to restore. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=694.38s)]
*  So at this point, is removing the mayor from office obligated? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=699.38s)]
*  I use the phrase at this time. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=704.38s)]
*  So you may move into this on the 1st? I will never surrender power that I have. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=709.38s)]
*  Is there anything that could happen coming out of the court that would take your mind? I'm not going to say at this time. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=714.38s)]
*  I need to see what the court happens. But I also, as I said, it is my duty [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=719.38s)]
*  as the governor of this state to make sure I'm aware of what's going on, that if there's problems [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=724.38s)]
*  that I intercede, but otherwise these are duly elected officials who have jobs to do as well. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=730.38s)]
*  Mark in the back. Governor, the mayor and Tom Holman [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=735.38s)]
*  did discuss putting ICE back in records. So with all these provisions that you're putting forward, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=740.38s)]
*  would that stop that? What position would you take and what would you do to allow that [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=745.38s)]
*  or stop that or any of the moves that they planned or hammered out between the two of them? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=750.38s)]
*  This becomes a question of whether or not that complies with the city charter and city ordinances. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=755.38s)]
*  And that's something I'll be watching. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=760.38s)]
*  Alissa? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=765.38s)]
*  This is subject to renewal at the end of 2025. What is the reason for that? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=770.38s)]
*  And what situation will be necessity continuing this past [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=775.38s)]
*  potentially, you know, the mayor's term? Ask me at the end of [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=780.38s)]
*  December 2025. Mac? Governor, the mayor has [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=785.38s)]
*  not answered any questions in the past few weeks about any of this stuff. He hasn't addressed the [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=790.38s)]
*  issue of the police. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=795.38s)]
*  Do you think that he should answer questions and be held more accountable and move that [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=800.38s)]
*  piece to New Yorkers here? I'm not his communications director. If he wants to do more [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=805.38s)]
*  interviews, get out there with the people, you know, I encourage him to just do the job. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=810.38s)]
*  You know, it seems to me he gets asked a lot of questions by all of you. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=815.38s)]
*  It is most important and I discussed let's focus on public safety. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=820.38s)]
*  What we're doing in the subways is extraordinary. Crime is down. Our plans to have more police [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=825.38s)]
*  is working overnight. Let's close more illegal cannabis shops. Let's get the city of [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=830.38s)]
*  Yesh jump start. Let's start making progress here, build more housing. We have so much to do [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=835.38s)]
*  in this city. I want to just move here, but I'm not taking my eyes off the [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=840.38s)]
*  situation. I want you to know that my eyes are still on the situation. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=845.38s)]
*  That's a good question. It had to be how home rule, home rule decision. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=850.38s)]
*  The city council would propose and then that has to be approved by the state legislature. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=855.38s)]
*  Yes, and I've had conversations with the two leaders already. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=860.38s)]
*  I don't set their timetable, but I said it'd be effective immediately once it's passed. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=865.38s)]
*  I don't set their timetable, but I said it'd be effective immediately once it's passed. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=870.38s)]
*  So that's up to the city council to take the first step. Then I'll go up to the legislature, which is [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=874.38s)]
*  will be in session again shortly. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=878.38s)]
*  These proposals would only be in place for 2025. And in addition to that, how much [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=883.38s)]
*  has the potential entry of former governor Cuomo into mayoral race weighed on how you proceed in this issue? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=888.38s)]
*  Zero. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=893.38s)]
*  So that's how long this would only apply in 2025? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=898.38s)]
*  Subject to renewal. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=903.38s)]
*  Hi, Governor. If former governor Cuomo is in peace somehow once the election, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=908.38s)]
*  is this something you're thinking about continuing? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=913.38s)]
*  I will look at the facts at the end of the year and determine what's best for the city. These are put in place as an [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=918.38s)]
*  opportunity to make decisions. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=923.38s)]
*  I understand that. Not since the 1970s with [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=928.38s)]
*  mayor Abeem and governor Hugh Carey when there was a crisis that required that level of intervention. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=933.38s)]
*  We are taking a number of steps that give us line of sight into budgetary matters, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=938.38s)]
*  investigative matters, and legal matters to ensure that there's no area where any decisions can be compromised. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=943.38s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=948.38s)]
*  I think it's important for the city to know that the right decisions are being made and the mayor has to take the time to rebuild the trust with the people of the city. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=953.38s)]
*  Those should go toward establishing people's understanding that there is other entities, the state of New York, is keeping an eye on the situation. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=958.38s)]
*  Chris? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=963.38s)]
*  Thank you, Governor. Since all of this is contingent legislation, have you lined up sponsors yet in both the state legislature and the council? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=968.38s)]
*  On the council side, I've already spoken to multiple council members who are [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=973.38s)]
*  expressing discontent about you kind of punting to them. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=978.38s)]
*  If you genuinely believe that there is concern about the mayor's ability to leave, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=983.38s)]
*  why punt to another body? Is there nothing you can do by excecutive power to restrict what's going on? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=988.38s)]
*  You know, it's not surprising there's difference of opinion in the city council. There will be difference of opinion [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=993.38s)]
*  up in the state legislature. It is the normal course of business. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=998.38s)]
*  I have spoken to leadership of both the city council, the speaker, and also spoken to [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1003.38s)]
*  Major Leader Andres Dura-Cousins and Speaker Carl Heastie. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1008.38s)]
*  It is a new concept to them. This is an extraordinary measure. I acknowledge that. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1013.38s)]
*  I don't expect me to propose it today and it becomes law tomorrow. It takes some time for people to understand what's behind it and to have questions. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1018.38s)]
*  And that's what a democracy is all about. So I am not ramming this down anyone's throat. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1024.38s)]
*  I am saying I believe this is a place we can go to reassure New Yorkers that the fears that I've heard from many of them [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1029.38s)]
*  will be unfounded because we have some systems in place. That's what I'm trying to do, which is try to stabilize the situation and calm it down. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1037.38s)]
*  There's no specific sponsors lined up. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1045.38s)]
*  I'm not taking the steps to line them up at this time. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1050.38s)]
*  I'll cross that when I get to it. I'm trying to deal with what is a crisis situation. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1055.38s)]
*  Got a few other things going on across the state as well. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1060.38s)]
*  I'm just going to focus on this and I need to be able to move on knowing that there's systems in place. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1065.38s)]
*  But I will work hard to help them understand that this is not a power grab. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1070.38s)]
*  I'm busy enough as governor, but I'm also not going to turn a blind eye to a situation that has put our city and our state in the national spotlight in a way that has been very negative. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1075.38s)]
*  And I just want us to get back to a place where people feel confident again and we stop being talked about all over the national news channels. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1086.38s)]
*  We have to get this situation under control. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1093.38s)]
*  I'm going to start the proceedings immediately and then start talking to the legislature about this. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1105.38s)]
*  I'm not waiting until after any elections. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1110.38s)]
*  There's a crisis of confidence now. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1115.38s)]
*  These are steps to try and move past that, to put safeguards in place. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1120.38s)]
*  I want to work with our local government and our local government to make sure that we're not going to have to do that. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1125.38s)]
*  I want to work with our legislators who I also believe would have the same objective of allowing 8.3 million people who occupy this great city, let them have some peace of mind to know that we're moving on. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1130.38s)]
*  But with our eyes on the situation. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1147.38s)]
*  That's what's most important. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1152.38s)]
*  I believe the council would have the two-thirds vote if they wanted to. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1157.38s)]
*  Home rule, you asked about the legislature as well. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1162.38s)]
*  We have a lot of deference to home rule requests. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1167.38s)]
*  When I was in local government, I had to put in home rule requests. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1172.38s)]
*  There's a lot of deference to that. That's our system of government here. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1177.38s)]
*  I believe the council would have the two-thirds vote if they wanted to. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1182.38s)]
*  I believe the council would have the two-thirds vote if they wanted to. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1187.38s)]
*  If the mayor is not involved, then it's a two-thirds vote in the council. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1192.38s)]
*  Last one. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1197.38s)]
*  You said earlier this week that you had serious concerns about the long-term future of the administration. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1202.38s)]
*  I believe that the council would have the two-thirds vote if they wanted to. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1207.38s)]
*  I believe the council would have the two-thirds vote if they wanted to. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1212.38s)]
*  The mayor needs to have a system in place, a line of sight into budgetary matters, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1217.38s)]
*  investigators matters as well as legal matters. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1222.38s)]
*  This is what gives me the confidence to know that there is a system in place of checks, if you will. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1227.38s)]
*  I want to be the mayor of New York. I love being the governor of New York. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1232.38s)]
*  Thanks everybody. I appreciate it. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta3x4AaC-E0&t=1237.38s)]
