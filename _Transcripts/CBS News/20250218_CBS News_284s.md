# What to know about Delta flight's crash landing in Toronto
**CBS News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE)
*  Turning now to the terrifying crash landing of a Delta Airlines plane in Toronto. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=0.0s)]
*  You see next to me the plane upside down on the snowy tarmac. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=5.0s)]
*  80 people were on board when the aircraft caught fire and flipped over. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=9.0s)]
*  Thankfully everyone survived but at least 18 people were injured. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=14.0s)]
*  BBC News reporter Nadine Youssef is at the airport with the latest. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=18.0s)]
*  So I'm standing here at Toronto Pearson International Airport [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=22.0s)]
*  where some flights have since resumed after a plane had crashed earlier [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=25.0s)]
*  on the runway. It was a Delta Airlines flight flying from Minneapolis to Toronto. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=29.0s)]
*  It had crashed upon landing and had flipped over on its belly. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=35.0s)]
*  Now we know that all 80 people aboard are accounted for. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=39.0s)]
*  Authorities said that there were no fatalities reported [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=42.0s)]
*  and people were able to evacuate safely. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=45.0s)]
*  We do know however that 18 people were injured. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=48.0s)]
*  Now as for the cause of the crash that is still under investigation, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=50.0s)]
*  we don't know much. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=54.0s)]
*  Authorities have told us that when the plane landed the runway was dry. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=56.0s)]
*  There was some inclement weather yesterday, a heavy snow storm in Toronto. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=59.0s)]
*  But we were told that when the plane landed the runway was dry. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=63.0s)]
*  We were also told that crosswind conditions did not play a factor [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=67.0s)]
*  in why the plane had crashed in that way. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=70.0s)]
*  So we're still waiting to hear more. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=73.0s)]
*  But in the meantime as the investigation is ongoing, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=75.0s)]
*  parts of the runway at the airport have been closed [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=78.0s)]
*  which is causing some further delays and cancellations of flights. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=82.0s)]
*  And so authorities are telling passengers to expect more of that in the coming days [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=86.0s)]
*  as they work to figure out what has happened here. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=90.0s)]
*  Alright, just remarkable. Joining us now is Stephen Wallace. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=93.0s)]
*  He's the former director of accident investigations for the FAA, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=96.0s)]
*  the perfect person to speak to. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=99.0s)]
*  At a moment like this Stephen, you had 80 people on board, all survived. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=101.0s)]
*  Help us understand the safety measures that have to be in place for an outcome like this. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=105.0s)]
*  Well, I think you have to give full credit, as every expert has, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=112.0s)]
*  to the crash-fire rescue team there at Toronto Pearson Airport. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=117.0s)]
*  I mean, it seems that they were there immediately. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=123.0s)]
*  And now I just now saw this video that shows that clearly it hit very hard [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=127.0s)]
*  and there was immediately a fire. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=133.0s)]
*  So there may have been a slight element of luck in that the wing full of fuel broke off [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=136.0s)]
*  and so, but the efforts of the crash-fire rescue team at that airport [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=141.0s)]
*  are absolutely terrific and instrumental in the 100% survival rate. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=150.0s)]
*  And I think seeing that dramatic video, hearing what you're saying, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=156.0s)]
*  it speaks to how important it is to follow safety procedures [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=160.0s)]
*  and any small thing can be the difference between life and death. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=164.0s)]
*  You mentioned the wing snapping off. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=167.0s)]
*  Things like the construction of these aircraft are also a part of the success story. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=170.0s)]
*  And while there were some people who recorded themselves getting out the plane, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=175.0s)]
*  it's also another opportunity to say, don't do that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=179.0s)]
*  Don't grab your bags. Don't record anything. Just get to safety. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=181.0s)]
*  What else led to this? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=184.0s)]
*  Well, absolutely right. So in the 1980s, the world's aviation authorities [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=186.0s)]
*  went through considerable rulemaking measures to improve the survivability. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=190.0s)]
*  So the survivability in an accident and particularly, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=196.0s)]
*  so things like 16G dynamic pulse seats that were tested [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=202.0s)]
*  so they could survive the impact pulse of a typical crash. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=206.0s)]
*  And this airplane had all those been, and also many, many things that were sort of irrelevant [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=213.0s)]
*  that had to do with rapid deploying escape slides. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=219.0s)]
*  Obviously, this is an accident that proves what we all know, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=222.0s)]
*  that accidents never happen like they're supposed to. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=226.0s)]
*  So this airplane ended up upside down the slides, the rapid deploying slides. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=228.0s)]
*  That's all irrelevant. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=233.0s)]
*  I would point out here that there was an accident. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=236.0s)]
*  This is a lucky airport because in August of 2005 Air France crashed [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=239.0s)]
*  Airbus 340 there and 309 people got out of that aircraft without a life threatening injury [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=243.0s)]
*  while the airplane was completely destroyed by fire. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=250.0s)]
*  And the Transportation Safety Board in that finding said, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=255.0s)]
*  attributed it to unfavorable weather conditions and poor landing decisions. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=260.0s)]
*  Sort of a little bit without prejudging what happened in this accident. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=265.0s)]
*  Very much those will be areas of focus of this investigation. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=269.0s)]
*  And that was an accident 20 years ago. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=274.0s)]
*  Yeah, and our thanks to the crew helping people survive. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=276.0s)]
*  Stephen Wallace, great to have your insight. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=279.0s)]
*  Joining us this morning from Alexandria in Virginia. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_WgLGXmqRE&t=281.0s)]
