# 21 federal employees resign in protest over DOGE
**CBS News:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M)
*  Hello everyone, I'm Major Garrett in Washington. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight on America Decides, Budget Nailbiter. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=2.4s)]
*  House Republicans decided this would be budget resolution week. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Yesterday, Speaker Johnson asked for prayers. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=9.08s)]
*  Today, there were invocations about the moral imperatives of getting fiscal sanity returned [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=12.0s)]
*  to Washington, leaving this question hovering over the entire process. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=17.44s)]
*  Do Republican leaders in the House have sufficient votes to pass their multi-trillion dollar [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  budget blueprint? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=27.92s)]
*  Part of that conversation, how potential cuts to Medicaid could impact that outcome and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=29.44s)]
*  with it, much of the future of the Trump economic agenda. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=35.4s)]
*  I'm not sure why you're confused or why it's so hard to answer what five things you've [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=40.4s)]
*  done in the past week. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=44.64s)]
*  Continued confusion as Elon Musk tries a second time to obtain from federal workers an answer [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=48.68s)]
*  to this question. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=55.24s)]
*  What did you do last week? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=57.36s)]
*  A list of five bullet points. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=58.92s)]
*  Theoretically, if it's not submitted by tonight, midnight, those federal workers who don't [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=61.28s)]
*  comply might be fired. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=66.76s)]
*  The White House says a million federal workers have already completed this task. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=68.92s)]
*  Question, is it mandatory? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=73.36s)]
*  This is a day that ends in Y, so as you might expect, President Trump signed more executive [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=76.0s)]
*  orders. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=80.68s)]
*  Today, his focus was on copper, possibly placing tariffs on imports for the metal used in modern [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=81.68s)]
*  day aircraft, vehicles, ships, and other military hardware. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=88.08s)]
*  I want to start tonight here at the desk with Aaron Navarro and Scott McFarland. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=91.88s)]
*  Aaron, I want to talk to you first about 21 people who work in something related to the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=95.28s)]
*  Department of Government Efficiency who resigned today in what read to me like protest of what [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=102.28s)]
*  they're observing, what they no longer want to be associated with. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=108.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=111.72s)]
*  These are 21 anonymous employees who are working in what is now known as- [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=112.72s)]
*  They're real people. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=116.6s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=118.19999999999999s)]
*  What is now known as the US DOGE Services Department. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  They used to be in what was called the United States Digital Services Department, which [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=122.88s)]
*  was renamed DOGE on Trump's first day in office. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  These are holdovers. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=129.76s)]
*  These are not what you've heard of the 20-year-old software engineers that are making these cuts [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=130.76s)]
*  at DOGE. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=135.56s)]
*  These were people that had already been there, an agency that really supplements digital [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=136.56s)]
*  services of a lot of federal agencies. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=140.68s)]
*  In their letter, they lined up why they believe they cannot help DOGE in their effort. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  They said, quote, we will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE's actions. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=149.04s)]
*  They also detailed how the day after Trump was inaugurated, White House officials came [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=154.04s)]
*  and did 15-minute interviews with people in this office, asking them to identify themselves, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=159.36s)]
*  asking them about political loyalty, kind of showing where DOGE, formerly USDS, Digital [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=166.12s)]
*  Services, was heading. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=172.64s)]
*  And it sounded as if they are alarmed about some of the things that they have observed [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=175.04s)]
*  that the younger parts of the Department of Government Efficiency are undertaking in terms [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=180.6s)]
*  of federal data security and other aspects of their maneuvering around. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  And they write that they were going to be integrated a bit more fully into that effort. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=192.0s)]
*  And these, at least according to the list of anonymous employees, a lot of them were [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=196.28s)]
*  engineers. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=200.16s)]
*  And that data on the technical aspect would be used and utilized to carry out the mission [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=201.2s)]
*  Elon Musk has set for DOGE. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=205.88s)]
*  And about this to-do list, what does the White House have to say about that? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=208.64s)]
*  In the Oval Office just now, President Trump said if employees don't write back, they will [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=213.32s)]
*  end up eventually losing their jobs. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=219.48s)]
*  Carolyn Levitt, the White House press secretary, seemed to again say that it is up to federal [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=222.92s)]
*  agency heads to determine what respondents, non-respondents, the fate for them. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=227.04s)]
*  But again, federal agencies have DOGE employees within them. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=232.76s)]
*  They're the ones identifying the cuts. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=236.84s)]
*  I kind of don't believe that a federal agency head would buck the president or DOGE workers [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  when it comes to time to potentially terminate these workers. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=244.44s)]
*  We shall see. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=247.32s)]
*  Scott, this is a time of many overhaul efforts within the Department of Justice, the Federal [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=248.32s)]
*  Bureau of Investigation. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=254.12s)]
*  What is most on your mind this afternoon? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=255.32s)]
*  Well, the instability is itself a problem. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=257.36s)]
*  If you have a bunch of new bosses coming into any workplace, there's going to be a little [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=260.44s)]
*  instability. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=263.92s)]
*  If you have a whole wave of new rules coming into a workplace, there's going to be some [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=264.92s)]
*  instability. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=268.6s)]
*  But this is different. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=269.6s)]
*  This is of a different magnitude, Major. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=270.6s)]
*  We have FBI agents telling us that they're worried any minute now that email is going [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=271.6s)]
*  to pop up in their inbox, that they've been put on leave or that they've been fired because [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=276.2s)]
*  of either retaliation for being part of the January 6 investigation or because of changes [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=280.58s)]
*  at the top and reassignments that come from there. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=284.84s)]
*  It's hard to function as an FBI agent, as a public health official, as somebody there [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=287.4s)]
*  trying to watch out for security threats or risks if you're worried about your job every [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=292.84s)]
*  few minutes. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  And that in itself is becoming a problem. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  The inability to know where you're going to be tomorrow destabilizes the Justice Department. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=300.88s)]
*  And you don't want the Department of Justice necessarily to be focused on things other [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  than chasing terrorists, child predators and violent gangs. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=309.65999999999997s)]
*  And remind the audience what experience Cash Patel as the head of the FBI and Dan Bongino [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=313.16s)]
*  now, Deputy Director of the FBI, bring to the Bureau itself. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=319.6s)]
*  Well, they bring a mandate to be change agents and they bring brands as change agents and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=323.28s)]
*  people who are going to execute preferences of government. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=328.92s)]
*  Who've said a lot of things about the FBI but never actually been in it until now. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=331.68s)]
*  And that's distinctive. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=335.88s)]
*  Neither has any FBI experience. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=337.8s)]
*  You know how rare it is to have the top two officials with no FBI experience? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=339.88s)]
*  Never happened before in 117 years of the Bureau's existence. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=343.88s)]
*  That's caused concern among some of the current agents. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=347.76s)]
*  In fact, major of the FBI Agents Association, which represents current agents, had pleaded [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  with Cash Patel to install somebody with institutional memory into the number two position because [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=355.48s)]
*  that person has their fingerprints all over the day-to-day operations. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=360.04s)]
*  That didn't happen. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=364.28s)]
*  So there's the potential. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=365.28s)]
*  More turnover, more retirements, more resignations due to the culture change here. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=367.54s)]
*  Very quickly, Brian Driscoll, there's some drama about him. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=372.14000000000004s)]
*  Who is he and what's the drama? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=375.66s)]
*  He was the acting FBI Director before Cash Patel and pushed back on that request from [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=377.06s)]
*  the Department of Justice and Trump's allies to collect all the names of the FBI agents [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=381.90000000000003s)]
*  who are part of the January 6 investigations. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=385.74s)]
*  We're waiting to see what happens with him if he still has a home at the FBI now that [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=387.78000000000003s)]
*  Cash Patel's in charge. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=392.38s)]
*  Scott McFarland, Aaron Navarro, thank you very much. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYb-Pf8t7M&t=394.22s)]
