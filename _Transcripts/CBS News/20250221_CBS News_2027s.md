# Los Angeles district attorney's office to oppose new trial for Menendez brothers
**CBS News:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw)
*  We want to take you now to coverage from CBS News Los Angeles. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=0.0s)]
*  District Attorney Nathan Hochman is giving an update on the case against brothers Eric [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=5.2s)]
*  and Lyle Menendez. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=8.82s)]
*  We put in the hard work to understand the Menendez case. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=9.82s)]
*  We've reviewed over 50,000 trial transcript pages from two months long trials that the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=13.88s)]
*  Menendez's had back in the early 1990s. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=21.16s)]
*  We also have spoken to defense attorneys. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=25.42s)]
*  We've spoken to the prosecutors. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  We've spoken to law enforcement. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=29.58s)]
*  We've even spoken to every Menendez family member who wanted to speak with us. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=31.58s)]
*  So we've done the hard work to understand the Menendez case. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=37.82s)]
*  And right now the Menendez case is on three parallel tracks. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=41.86s)]
*  The first track is a habeas track. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=46.26s)]
*  That is a motion that was filed in May of 2023, where in that motion, the Menendez's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=48.86s)]
*  are saying that they have effectively new evidence. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=55.22s)]
*  And we'll get into this in more detail in a moment. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=59.22s)]
*  New evidence that militates and warrants and justifies a new trial. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=62.14s)]
*  The second track is a petition for clemency that the Menendez's have taken directly to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=68.02s)]
*  Governor Newsom. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=73.6s)]
*  Governor Newsom has the constitutional power, and it's unilateral, to grant that petition [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=75.38s)]
*  of clemency and commute Menendez's case and release them immediately. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=81.36s)]
*  He has that power today. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=86.78s)]
*  He's had that power since 2019. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=89.06s)]
*  He can exercise it, however he has no deadline. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=91.82000000000001s)]
*  There's no court hearing, and there's no appeal from his exercise of that power. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=94.9s)]
*  And the third track is a track called re-sentencing. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=99.9s)]
*  Resentencing is a somewhat California notion. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=103.78s)]
*  There's not too many states that have a re-sentencing statute. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=107.66s)]
*  The re-sentencing gets triggered by a district attorney's motion, or in some circumstances, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=111.94s)]
*  the motion of a court. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=117.46s)]
*  And that motion, unlike a habeas motion, where a habeas motion will focus on the trial itself, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=119.3s)]
*  a re-sentencing motion focuses on that trial but goes beyond that and deals with rehabilitation [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=127.13999999999999s)]
*  and other factors. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=133.45999999999998s)]
*  Today we're going to focus in two different things. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=136.29999999999998s)]
*  The first is in order to explain the procedures that the Menendez case has gone through, we [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=139.29999999999998s)]
*  have created a video that can be accessed at our website, which is da.lacounty.gov. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=146.06s)]
*  Again, that's da.lacounty.gov. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=154.18s)]
*  And that video actually does an anatomy of the Menendez case. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=158.46s)]
*  And it takes the case from the murders itself back on August 20th of 1989 through the investigation [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=163.14000000000001s)]
*  into the charges that were filed in the arrests. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=171.62s)]
*  Then it looks at the motions that were filed by the Menendezes prior to the trials. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=174.98s)]
*  Then it looks at the first trial, which resulted in hung juries. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=180.1s)]
*  Then the second trial, which resulted in convictions for first-degree murder of both Jose Menendez, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=183.85999999999999s)]
*  the father, and a separate first-degree murder conviction for Kitty Menendez, the mother, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=190.98s)]
*  as well as a conviction for conspiracy to commit murder and certain special circumstances, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=196.62s)]
*  of lying in wait and multiple murders. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=203.66s)]
*  That video then continues on, though. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=206.62s)]
*  It goes through the penalty phase, where the Menendezes were either facing the death penalty [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=208.82s)]
*  or life without the possibility of parole, as determined by a jury. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=213.5s)]
*  Then the sentencing. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=217.9s)]
*  Then it actually goes through the various appeals, the direct appeals, all the way up [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=219.26s)]
*  to the California Supreme Court. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=223.38s)]
*  The first habeas petition, again with the California Supreme Court. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=225.68s)]
*  The federal habeas petitions with a U.S. District Court and a Ninth Circuit Court [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=230.42s)]
*  of Appeals. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=235.22s)]
*  In all those situations, as you will hear, the Menendezes have raised many of the same [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=237.38s)]
*  exact arguments that they raised in the current habeas petition. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=242.85999999999999s)]
*  Those arguments have been heard by a variety of courts, from the trial judge to the direct [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=247.5s)]
*  appeal court of appeals in California's Supreme Court, to the California Supreme Court again, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=252.5s)]
*  to the federal courts. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=257.78s)]
*  They've considered these arguments, and they have been routinely and repeatedly rejected. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=259.38s)]
*  So we have the video that is coming out, and go through this procedural history, so that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=266.1s)]
*  people can actually learn from the Menendez case, and actually educate themselves on the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=271.78s)]
*  criminal justice system. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=277.82s)]
*  What I have said very often is that the Menendez case is the portal by which people come into [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=280.18s)]
*  the criminal justice system, and show an interest in it, to find out what's happening. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=285.64s)]
*  Then hopefully they will educate them further about what happened, not just in the Menendez [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=290.64s)]
*  case, but cases, criminal cases, that are occurring throughout this entire county, this [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  state, and this country, every single day. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=300.88s)]
*  So the video is coming out today, and it will be out on our website. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=305.32s)]
*  The second thing that we have done today is that we have filed an informal response in [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=309.9s)]
*  connection with the habeas motion. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=314.82s)]
*  As I mentioned before, there are these three parallel tracks, the habeas, the clemency, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  the resentencing. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=322.06s)]
*  Again, the clemency is up to the governor. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=323.06s)]
*  Resentencing we will be dealing with in the future, in the next coming weeks, with our [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=326.42s)]
*  response. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=330.82s)]
*  But today we have filed the informal response on the habeas petition. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=331.82s)]
*  Now, something you need to know about a habeas petition, it's not the direct appeal. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=336.42s)]
*  The Menendez's have already had their direct appeal through the California Court of Appeals [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=341.84s)]
*  and California Supreme Court, and they have lost. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=346.09999999999997s)]
*  They've even had one level of California habeas, which they lost, and one level of [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=349.44s)]
*  federal habeas, which they've also lost. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=354.64s)]
*  So now they've come back for a second California habeas petition. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=357.64s)]
*  And in coming back for that, they have basically said there are two new pieces of evidence, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=363.12s)]
*  along with their arguments, that justify them getting a new trial. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=368.12s)]
*  Now, in a habeas petition, there are very rigorous requirements to actually get that [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=372.52s)]
*  new trial, which makes sense, because you've already gone through all these different layers [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=378.5s)]
*  of review, and if you've been rejected time and time again, at some point the system says [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=383.38s)]
*  that unless you have something very new and very compelling that is more likely to change [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=388.94s)]
*  the outcome of this case, then we are going to again reject your habeas petition. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=394.72s)]
*  So when they come out in this case, they come out with two new pieces of evidence, one piece [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=400.8s)]
*  being an undated photocopy of a letter purportedly sent by Eric Menendez to his cousin Andy Cano [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=406.44000000000005s)]
*  at approximately December 1988, although there's no date on the letter, in which it discusses [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=414.36s)]
*  that was being experienced by Eric, perpetrated against him by his father at that time. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=421.92s)]
*  That's the one piece of evidence that they've come forward, but they also came forward with [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=428.2s)]
*  a second piece of allegedly new evidence. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=431.48s)]
*  The second piece of new evidence was a declaration by Roy Rossello, who basically said that in [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  the early 1980s, he had been sexually abused by Jose Menendez. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=441.40000000000003s)]
*  The standard to actually have a successful habeas petition requires that you meet all [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=447.08s)]
*  of the following requirements. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=453.08s)]
*  You have to show that it's new evidence. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=455.36s)]
*  You have to show that it's timely, that it was evidence that could not be discovered [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=457.9s)]
*  at the time of the trial, but only could be discovered after the trial. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=462.68s)]
*  You have to show that you did not engage in any substantial delay between the time you [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=467.12s)]
*  learned about the evidence and the time you brought your motion. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=471.66s)]
*  The evidence has to be admissible, and the evidence has to be credible. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=475.79999999999995s)]
*  Now the overall argument about this new evidence, again, new evidence effectively dealing with [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=480.4s)]
*  sexual abuse that Eric Menendez experienced by his father or a gentleman named Roy Rossello [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=485.67999999999995s)]
*  experienced by Jose Menendez, the defense has now argued the following. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=493.44s)]
*  We've said to resolve this case, jurors had to decide a single critical question. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=499.56s)]
*  Was Jose Menendez molesting his sons? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=505.48s)]
*  The problem with saying that that is the critical question in the Menendez trial is that it's [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=509.08000000000004s)]
*  wrong. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=514.12s)]
*  The jury never in any of the two juries had to resolve the question of whether Menendez [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=515.36s)]
*  brothers were sexually molested. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=520.72s)]
*  In fact, the counsel, Leslie Abrahamson, 30 years before during these trials, properly [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=523.32s)]
*  framed where sexual abuse comes into play. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=531.0400000000001s)]
*  What she said back then is that we have never said that because you're abused, you're justified [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=534.84s)]
*  in killing your abuser. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=540.5400000000001s)]
*  We didn't argue that, and we never will. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=542.46s)]
*  Well, 30 years later, apparently, the Menendez counsel is arguing just that. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=545.8000000000001s)]
*  What the jury had to figure out is on the night of August 20, 1989, did the Menendez's [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=552.2s)]
*  conspire to kill both their father and their mother that night? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=558.48s)]
*  Did they in fact kill them? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=563.08s)]
*  What was their state of mind at that time on the night of August 20, 1989? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=565.08s)]
*  Did they engage in these killings willfully, deliberately, and with premeditation, or was [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=572.2s)]
*  it an act of self-defense? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=580.12s)]
*  They had an actual fear of eminent harm that both their father and their mother was going [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=582.32s)]
*  to kill them, and they acted in self-defense. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=587.8s)]
*  The sexual abuse part, as Leslie Abrahamson recognized correctly back then, was not a fourth [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=591.36s)]
*  question for the jury to answer. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=599.1s)]
*  So when we look now at the factors dealing with this new evidence, we can go through [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=602.4s)]
*  these factors. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=607.28s)]
*  Only evidence that is discovered after the trial for which there is no substantial delay [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=609.8s)]
*  in presenting it. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=616.04s)]
*  Well, if this letter, supposedly dated December 1988, between written by Eric Menendez to [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=617.4799999999999s)]
*  Andy Cano, is to be believed, and that it was actually sent at that time, here's what [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=625.2199999999999s)]
*  we know. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=631.9599999999999s)]
*  We know that Eric Menendez, during his second trial, testified for seven days about graphic [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=633.16s)]
*  descriptions of the sexual abuse that he had encountered by his father between the [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=640.56s)]
*  ages of six and 18. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=645.8s)]
*  He also talked about sexual abuse that his brother Lyle had experienced by his father [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=648.36s)]
*  between the ages of six and eight. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=654.6s)]
*  That evidence was brought in, and he was asked about who he spoke to about this sexual [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=658.6s)]
*  abuse during that time period. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=663.96s)]
*  He said he had spoken to Andy Cano. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=665.62s)]
*  When did he speak to Andy Cano? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=668.88s)]
*  He said when he was between the ages of 12 and 13, and Andy Cano was approximately 10 [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=671.26s)]
*  years old. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=676.76s)]
*  That was before Eric Menendez moved from New Jersey to California, roughly six years before [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=677.84s)]
*  these 1989 killings. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=685.52s)]
*  So Andy Cano also testified in the trial, and Andy Cano relayed the same information [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=689.04s)]
*  that he had had this conversation with Eric Menendez six years before the 1989 killings [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=696.04s)]
*  when he was 10 and Eric Menendez was either 12 or 13. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=702.02s)]
*  They spoke several times that year, and that was the only conversations they had about [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=705.4399999999999s)]
*  the sexual abuse, only communications they had. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=711.48s)]
*  So now we have a letter filed in May of 2023 that is supposedly a 1988 letter written from [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=715.16s)]
*  Eric Menendez to Andy Cano about this sexual abuse, never discussed in any of the two trials [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=725.26s)]
*  when Eric Menendez testified or Andy Cano testified. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=733.16s)]
*  And we believe it's inconceivable, as we've argued in our papers, and defies common sense [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=738.28s)]
*  that if they had evidence that would show that sexual abuse had been communicated not [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=744.2s)]
*  just six years before the events, but nine months before the 1989 killings, that it would [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=750.62s)]
*  absolutely have come out during one or both of their testimonies. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=758.0400000000001s)]
*  So the fact that it didn't come out, again, goes to whether or not this evidence first [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=763.5s)]
*  was discovered after the trial. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=768.76s)]
*  If Eric Menendez wrote this letter, he had it or knew about it or Andy Cano had it and [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=771.32s)]
*  certainly knew about it by the time of the 1993 trials. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=777.2800000000001s)]
*  In fact, it's a 1980 letter. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=782.0400000000001s)]
*  They would certainly have it by the time of the 1995 trials. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=786.1s)]
*  So to say that this letter was not discovered after the trial, as it's been alleged in the [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=790.0s)]
*  defense papers, we believe is just wrong. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=795.7s)]
*  The second thing with this letter is that if the letter was real, then the question [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=800.3s)]
*  is when is the substantial delay triggered in actually filing this motion? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=806.4s)]
*  So what you find in the motion is Eric Menendez is saying, I didn't know about the letter [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=812.26s)]
*  until effectively a 2015 special by Barbara Walters where this letter had been given to [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=817.6999999999999s)]
*  and she actually broadcast this letter in 2015. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=826.42s)]
*  But remember, this motion, this habeas motion, this second habeas motion was not brought [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=830.74s)]
*  in 2015. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=836.2199999999999s)]
*  It wasn't brought in 2020. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=838.02s)]
*  It was brought in 2023. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=839.78s)]
*  So one of the additional standards for a habeas motion is that you do not engage in substantial [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=842.9s)]
*  delay in bringing this motion. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=848.06s)]
*  Andy Cano had long since passed. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=851.3s)]
*  He passed in 2003. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=853.66s)]
*  So he was not around to actually cross-examine and see if this letter was an actual letter [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=856.26s)]
*  that he had received or not. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=862.14s)]
*  Or perhaps he received it, but he didn't receive it in 1988. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=864.38s)]
*  He received it at some date much later than that. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=868.48s)]
*  So this particular letter could have been discovered prior or during the trials and [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=871.9s)]
*  presented after substantial delay, even when both Lyle and Eric Menendez say that they [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=878.6999999999999s)]
*  had this letter. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=886.58s)]
*  The third standard is admissibility. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=889.1s)]
*  Let me deal with the Roy Rossellos letter to give you an idea how the admissibility [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=891.9s)]
*  standard works. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=896.14s)]
*  The letter has to comply with the admissibility standards of evidence in a court. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=898.06s)]
*  Now remember, in 1989, August 20th, the issue is what is going on in Eric and Lyle's head [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=904.54s)]
*  at the time they shotgunned their parents 12 times to their death. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=911.86s)]
*  Are they again have an actual fear of imminent harm and death that their parents were going [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=916.98s)]
*  to kill them that night? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=923.98s)]
*  Or was it a willful, premeditated, and deliberate act on their part? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=925.9s)]
*  What they have said about the Roy Rossellos allegations that he was sexually abused by [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=930.5s)]
*  Jose Menendez in the early 1980s is that they didn't know about this in 1989. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=935.82s)]
*  They didn't know about this in 1999 or 2009. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=942.86s)]
*  They first found out about this in 2022, or approximately 2022, about 30 years later after [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=947.04s)]
*  the killings. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=954.9s)]
*  So the evidence, if in fact this is true, of what Roy Rossellos is saying, would not [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=956.3s)]
*  be admissible to show their state of mind in 1989 because they didn't know about it [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=962.78s)]
*  in 1989. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=969.5799999999999s)]
*  So again, it would fail the admissibility standard as we've argued in our habeas informal [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=971.74s)]
*  response. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=977.42s)]
*  The last standard, of course, is credibility. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=978.9799999999999s)]
*  Is this credible evidence? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=982.5s)]
*  We argue in many different ways it is not credible evidence. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=984.42s)]
*  The first way, as I've discussed before, is that if they had this evidence, if this [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=988.4s)]
*  letter truly existed, the defense counsel would have absolutely used it at the trial [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=993.3399999999999s)]
*  because it would have helped corroborate both Eric Menendez's testimony about sexual abuse [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1000.14s)]
*  and Andy Cano's testimony about sexual abuse because that letter was eight months, roughly [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1005.6999999999999s)]
*  eight or nine months before the murders, not six years before the murders. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1012.14s)]
*  But it was never mentioned, its contents were never mentioned, it was never produced or [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1017.04s)]
*  in any way used during either one of the two trials. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1021.26s)]
*  But the notion that this letter could be part of a continuum of lies and deceit and fabricating [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1025.92s)]
*  stories required us to go back into the history of the Menendez case to analyze whether or [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1033.7s)]
*  not that would be true. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1040.5s)]
*  And when we analyzed that, what we found out is that Eric and Lyle Menendez had told five [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1043.74s)]
*  different versions of the events of what had happened. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1051.3s)]
*  The first version that they told is that they did not kill their parents. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1055.6000000000001s)]
*  This was the version they told when they were first confronted or they first made their [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1060.98s)]
*  911 call and they said that someone had murdered their parents, obviously not them. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1065.62s)]
*  When they confronted the police and the police showed up that night, they ran out screaming [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1071.4199999999998s)]
*  and crying that their parents had been murdered, they'd come home and found them that way. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1076.26s)]
*  They didn't admit it themselves. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1080.54s)]
*  That they went ahead and in that version again, they said it was a mafia hit and they had [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1083.1799999999998s)]
*  the police investigate whether or not Jose Menendez had been killed by the mafia. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1090.54s)]
*  That was the first version. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1096.38s)]
*  The section version was that their father was a violent sexual predator who raped Lyle's [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1097.98s)]
*  girlfriend. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1105.18s)]
*  This was a version that was shown when Lyle's girlfriend came forward and said that Lyle [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1106.22s)]
*  had confronted her and said that he wanted her to testify that his dad had violently [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1113.22s)]
*  raped her and that he wanted her to testify at trial. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1119.26s)]
*  She refused to do so. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1123.46s)]
*  The third version that Lyle told was that their father had molested Eric but the mother [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1126.06s)]
*  had molested Lyle without any mention of Lyle being molested by his father. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1132.26s)]
*  Again, that version ultimately didn't show up at trial in their defense. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1138.22s)]
*  The fourth version is that Eric and Lyle were both molested by their father and the [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1144.06s)]
*  fifth version is that both their father and their mother were going to kill them the night [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1149.34s)]
*  of August 20, 1989, which is why they shot them first. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1154.5s)]
*  I want to focus on the difference in many respects between the fourth and the fifth [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1160.4199999999998s)]
*  versions because again, the key for the trial is basically what happened that night. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1165.1s)]
*  What was in their head that night? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1171.5s)]
*  Sexual abuse is abhorrent and we will prosecute sexual abuse in any form it comes. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1174.7s)]
*  But sexual abuse in this situation, while it may have been a motivation for Eric and [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1182.4s)]
*  Lyle to do what they did, does not constitute self-defense. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1188.98s)]
*  And that's why Leslie Abrahamson said back in 1993 that sexual abuse does not justify [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1194.94s)]
*  killing your parents and that they would never argue that. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1203.78s)]
*  So, what happens in the continuum is we analyze some of the examples of the lies, differing [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1208.78s)]
*  stories, that have been told is that we actually saw stuff that was lied about before the killings [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1215.8200000000002s)]
*  during at the time of the killings and in the months and years afterwards. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1223.1399999999999s)]
*  This evidence ranges from everything, including days before the killings, the Menendezes didn't [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1229.04s)]
*  go ahead and get their shotguns in Los Angeles and use their real names. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1237.46s)]
*  They drove down to San Diego and used a fake ID and a fake address of one of Lyle's friends. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1243.1s)]
*  Hours before the murders happened, they came up with a pre-planned alibi where they had [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1250.98s)]
*  actually gone ahead and contacted one of their friends to say that they were going to go [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1257.56s)]
*  to Batman the movie that night and they would meet the friend afterwards at the Taste of [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1263.24s)]
*  L.A. event. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1268.6599999999999s)]
*  During the murders, the way that the murders actually happened was instructive to understand [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1270.9399999999998s)]
*  the deceit and the planning that went into it. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1277.34s)]
*  There was over 12 shotgun blasts that occurred that night. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1280.8s)]
*  One of the shotgun blasts was to Jose Menendez through the back of his head. After he was [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1285.22s)]
*  dead, there were shotgun blasts to each one of his knees. The shotgun blast to the mom [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1292.5s)]
*  initially didn't kill her. She actually ended up lying on the ground groaning and bleeding [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1298.9s)]
*  in pain. That's at the point where Lyle and Eric Menendez had run out of ammunition, reload, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1304.86s)]
*  and Lyle puts the reloaded shotgun up to his mother's face and pulls the trigger, thus [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1312.26s)]
*  staging it at the time like a gangland hit, which then becomes their deceit and lie in [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1318.8999999999999s)]
*  the ensuing months that occurred. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1326.1399999999999s)]
*  Then you had the deception that occurred where they hid the evidence of their crime. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1330.7s)]
*  They had the wherewithal that night before they left the house to pick up each one of [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1337.18s)]
*  the shotgun shells that had been expended. They then had the shotgun shells with them. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1342.18s)]
*  They had the bloody clothing and the shotguns. They proceeded to go to Mulholland Drive to [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1348.06s)]
*  dump the shotguns and to a car wash's dumpster to drop off the shotgun shells and their bloody [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1353.3400000000001s)]
*  clothing. Then they decided to execute the pre-planned alibi. Again, the deliberate premeditated [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1359.34s)]
*  state at this point where they went ahead and they actually went to the movie theater [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1367.34s)]
*  to get the tickets for Batman the Movie. Turns out that they couldn't get the 8 o'clock [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1371.78s)]
*  tickets because it was already past 10 o'clock. Then they called their friend to meet him [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1376.62s)]
*  at the Taste of L.A., but by the point they got there, he'd already moved on. Then they [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1381.3s)]
*  actually called the friend to meet him again in another restaurant and they never show [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1386.22s)]
*  up. Eventually that friend comes to the house later that night only to see police tape around [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1389.98s)]
*  the house. Now after they were arrested, the Menendez's also tried to suborn Perjury in [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1395.6200000000001s)]
*  a number of different respects. They contacted one of Lyle's girlfriends, Tracy Baker, gave [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1407.74s)]
*  her an actual script, a script that was actually found by the police where it said that they [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1415.74s)]
*  wanted her to testify that Lyle's mother, Kitty Menendez, had poisoned them, had poisoned [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1422.74s)]
*  the whole family. She actually did testify to this extent in the first trial, but didn't [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1428.58s)]
*  testify to this in the second trial. They also contacted one of Eric's friends, Brian [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1434.58s)]
*  Eslamania, and asked him to falsely testify that Eric and Lyle Menendez were so fearful [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1442.1399999999999s)]
*  of their parents the weeks before the murders that they tried to borrow a handgun from Eslamania. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1448.6399999999999s)]
*  He wouldn't testify to this. They also again, as I mentioned before, asked a different girlfriend [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1456.06s)]
*  of Lyle if she would testify that Jose Menendez had violently raped her, and she wouldn't [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1463.4199999999998s)]
*  do that either. Finally, when it dealt with the handguns themselves, the Menendez's both [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1469.9s)]
*  testified that they had gone to the Big Five Sporting Goods in Santa Monica to actually [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1475.22s)]
*  buy handguns before they switched to the shotguns, but it turns out the Big Five Sporting Goods [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1480.7s)]
*  in Santa Monica in 1989 didn't sell handguns. So we looked at again the credibility of the [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1486.38s)]
*  letters, and particularly this Andy Cano 1988 supposed letter, weighed it in the continuum [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1494.38s)]
*  of lies, and it calls into drastic question whether or not this is in fact a 1988 letter [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1503.46s)]
*  written by Eric Menendez to Andy Cano about this sexual abuse. But again, even if it is, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1511.9s)]
*  it's not timely because it was not presented at the time of trial. They substantially delayed [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1519.7800000000002s)]
*  in bringing this motion from at least 2015 to 2023, and in certain respects it's also [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1527.02s)]
*  not admissible, which is why we conclude in our informal response that the court should [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1535.7s)]
*  deny the current habeas petition by the Menendez brothers, and if the court decides not to [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1542.82s)]
*  deny it at this point, the next motion or move for the court is to order what's called [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1549.86s)]
*  an order to show cause. Then we will file this again, this response in response to the [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1555.26s)]
*  order to show cause. The Menendez's can reply, and the court can rule at that point or have [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1561.02s)]
*  a hearing in the habeas matter. So this is what we have been up to with respect to the [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1566.78s)]
*  habeas petition. Again, as I mentioned before, the governor has the clemency petition on [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1573.98s)]
*  his desk and he can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and we will be dealing [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1579.02s)]
*  in the next couple weeks with the re-sentencing issue. Let me stop at this point and take [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1583.3999999999999s)]
*  questions and at the end of this I'll have Maria Ramirez address the Spanish speaking [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1588.94s)]
*  audience on these issues. So what I said to the family is that I would listen to them, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1594.3s)]
*  and we did. We met with the family for hours and I heard all the issues that they have [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1609.26s)]
*  and all the concerns that they have and all the experiences that they shared with me during [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1615.48s)]
*  those conversations. Much of that deals with rehabilitation. Rehabilitation is not an issue [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1620.2s)]
*  for the habeas motion. I want to make that crystal clear, that all the talk about rehabilitation [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1627.68s)]
*  will be talk that will be focused on in the re-sentencing motion. But as I mentioned [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1634.32s)]
*  before, the habeas motion focuses on the evidence at trial and any new evidence that might materially [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1639.6000000000001s)]
*  affect the outcome of that trial. Yes? It seems that your examination of the case file [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1647.0s)]
*  so far has been significant. You demonstrate clear mastery of what you've seen, but it [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1652.4399999999998s)]
*  also sounds like you're casting doubt on the brothers' assertion that they were serially [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1658.3799999999999s)]
*  sexually abused by your father. Again, what we have done is we've gone through all the [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1664.82s)]
*  evidence at the trial, which is the evidence that we have to work with. We looked at any [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1669.6399999999999s)]
*  testimony that was given by Eric and Lyle Menendez in the first trial or just Eric Menendez [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1676.1000000000001s)]
*  in the second trial. We looked at all testimony that was given in support of the defense in [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1681.98s)]
*  either trial. We looked at any additional statements that we were given of people who [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1687.06s)]
*  had any level of percipient knowledge of the sexual abuse. We certainly looked at any other [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1692.38s)]
*  circumstance that deals with this question. And in looking at that, again, as I point [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1700.38s)]
*  out, that was the fourth version of what was told by the Menendez's in real time back in [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1705.3400000000001s)]
*  the 1990s. So having reviewed 50,000 pages of documents, etc., do you personally now [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1712.46s)]
*  believe that they were not sexually abused by at least Jose Menendez? What I believe [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1717.7800000000002s)]
*  is that they testified to that sexual abuse. They absolutely testified to it in great detail. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1723.7s)]
*  I also understand that when it came to any corroborating information about that sexual [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1730.22s)]
*  abuse, it was extremely lacking. In fact, there were other—and the fact that it was [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1736.18s)]
*  their fourth version. In other words, they didn't come out initially and say, we killed [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1746.0600000000002s)]
*  our parents because our father sexually abused us. They didn't go ahead and when they got [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1750.96s)]
*  arrested tell anyone that. They were saying it was a mafia hit and somebody else did it. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1756.24s)]
*  They then, once they were arrested, they didn't again come out initially and say, my father [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1761.72s)]
*  sexually abused me. In fact, just the opposite. They were trying to say Lyle's girlfriend [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1767.16s)]
*  was violently raped by the father. Then the next version wasn't that the father sexually [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1772.5s)]
*  abused both of them. The father sexually abused Eric, but the mother sexually abused Lyle. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1778.16s)]
*  So then you finally—and then you had, as you're aware, the Dr. Ozeal tapes, where [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1785.48s)]
*  they didn't believe those tapes would ever be made public. But in those tapes, where [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1790.4s)]
*  Eric had gone to Dr. Ozeal because he was suicidal and he needed to tell someone that [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1796.6000000000001s)]
*  he had actually killed his parents. At no point in any of those conversations that occur [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1802.42s)]
*  in late 1989 does Eric say that he was sexually abused by his father and that that was any [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1808.46s)]
*  reason or played any role in what happened. Lyle, who's also interviewed by Dr. Ozeal [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1815.3200000000002s)]
*  on tape, doesn't discuss that as well. And with respect to the mother, here's what [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1821.46s)]
*  they told Dr. Ozeal. They said that they had killed the mother because they didn't want [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1826.42s)]
*  her to be a witness to the crime. That was reason one. The second reason they killed [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1831.1399999999999s)]
*  the mother is they thought that she was leading such a miserable life because the dad was [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1835.82s)]
*  cheating on her that they basically thought that they were doing her a favor, which was [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1841.2199999999998s)]
*  the third reason, which is effectively a mercy killing, whereas Dr. Ozeal testified euthanasia [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1847.1s)]
*  as to why they were killing the mother. At no point do they tell Dr. Ozeal the father [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1853.4199999999998s)]
*  was sexually abusing them and the mother condoned it. What I'm saying is that the [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1858.38s)]
*  evidence, to the extent that evidence can include their own testimony, certainly that [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1868.18s)]
*  evidence exists. Eric Menendez testified for seven days in the second trial in graphic [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1873.3400000000001s)]
*  detail incident by incident describing the sexual abuse he experienced by his father. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1879.98s)]
*  Andy Kano talked about a conversation he had when he was 10, not when he was 16, but when [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1887.8600000000001s)]
*  he was 10, and Eric was 12 or 13, where Eric was describing that sexual abuse. So if you're [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1895.3s)]
*  asking was there evidence presented in the trial about it, there certainly was. If you're [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1901.6200000000001s)]
*  also asking me, has new additional evidence come out about that beyond the Andy Kano letter, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1906.58s)]
*  there is none, or at least it certainly hasn't been discovered by the prosecution and hasn't [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1914.22s)]
*  been presented by the defense. Have you tried to authenticate that letter? We've asked for [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1919.62s)]
*  an original copy. The only way to truly authenticate that letter, there's only three ways you can [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1926.6999999999998s)]
*  do it. One, you need the original copy, or you need an envelope with a postmark. We've [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1931.86s)]
*  not been presented with the original. We've not been presented with an envelope with a [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1936.54s)]
*  postmark. The second is Eric Menendez. He himself, in a declaration under penalty of [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1940.42s)]
*  perjury, has said that he wrote that letter in December of 1988, and the only third person [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1946.46s)]
*  who could probably authenticate that is Andy Kano, who passed away in 2003. Mr. Attorney, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1951.7s)]
*  do you believe that the Menendez brothers should be free? Right now we are in the question [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1956.7s)]
*  and answer portion of a live media update from Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1963.98s)]
*  Hockman, newly elected, taking a fresh look at the case of brothers Eric and Lyle Menendez, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1969.7s)]
*  convicted of murdering their parents in 1989. The district attorney today saying the court [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1976.7s)]
*  should deny the current habeas petition by the brothers. A habeas petition essentially [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klRcUAu6gHw&t=1982.74s)]
