# Latest weather forecast as brutal snow storm hits the South
**CBS News:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4)
*  All right, check this out. Snow blanketing parts of the U. S. That are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=0.0s)]
*  not used to this kind of weather. This major winter storm system moving out of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=4.4s)]
*  the southern states now, but it's leaving behind bitter cold temperatures [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=9.18s)]
*  and nearly a foot of snowfall in parts of the deep south places like Mobile, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=12.8s)]
*  Alabama, New Orleans and even parts of florida are facing record level snowfall. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=17.66s)]
*  Take a live look at Interstate 10 in New Orleans. The winter storm prompted [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  authorities to close a 100 mile stretch of that interstate, protecting [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=27.26s)]
*  drivers from dangerous road conditions. Now, this all spans nearly half the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=31.660000000000004s)]
*  state. And this just in the NBA has postponed the Bucks pelicans game due [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=36.02s)]
*  to this storm. Let's bring in CBS News correspondent Skyler Henry. He is [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=41.5s)]
*  joining us live from Tallahassee florida. It is so bizarre, Skyler to be [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=45.18000000000001s)]
*  coming to you in Tallahassee florida with snow in the background. It's just [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=49.82s)]
*  this is this is bizarre. How's it feeling for you out there? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=53.9s)]
*  I keep saying I'm in the south. I'm in the south. This is not supposed to be [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=59.5s)]
*  happening. And here we are record breaking snow all across the gulf here [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  in Tallahassee. It's nearly two inches of snow overnight, but to our west [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=68.06s)]
*  specifically, especially in cities like Pensacola. And you pointed out Mobile, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=73.5s)]
*  New Orleans, all seeing high levels of snow accumulation in some cases more [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=77.98s)]
*  than seven and a half inches of snowfall, so much so that what are [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=82.86s)]
*  usually white sandy beaches are now white snowy beaches. And so that is [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=87.17999999999999s)]
*  something that this part of the region is dealing with. We have spoken with [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=93.66s)]
*  emergency management crews who have talked about the challenges with [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=96.88s)]
*  something like this, especially considering that this is not something [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  that this region is normally accustomed to as far as not only manpower but [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=103.8s)]
*  resources. Remember, there aren't really a whole bunch of snow plows in [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=108.54s)]
*  florida, let alone Alabama or Louisiana. And so we have seen other states and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=112.46000000000001s)]
*  companies supply the region with their stock to try to help clear some of this [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=117.72s)]
*  historic snow out of the way. Still, the temperatures are bitterly cold here. It [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=123.10000000000001s)]
*  is expected to get into the teens tonight here in Tallahassee. And that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=128.1s)]
*  is something else that crews say that they are concerned about that refreeze [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=132.06s)]
*  were at the slushy portion of this wintry weather event where cars more [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=135.78s)]
*  cars are on the road. But they say that they are concerned that once this sun [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=139.82000000000002s)]
*  goes back down and once these rose starts to freeze back over how dangerous [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=144.3s)]
*  the conditions could potentially be. And so they're still urging people not [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=149.26000000000002s)]
*  only here in florida but in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana as well to try to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=152.46s)]
*  stay home if you can because of what challenging conditions could [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=156.78s)]
*  potentially be out there. Yeah, I've seen a number of cards passed behind [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=160.18s)]
*  you there, Skyler going pretty fast and I can imagine they're still kind of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=163.34s)]
*  getting used to driving in these types of conditions. What happens once the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=166.74s)]
*  road conditions get so dangerous? Do they just close off the roads or [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=171.46s)]
*  businesses closed as well? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=174.38000000000002s)]
*  Well, for a city like Tallahassee, a bunch of different things asked for [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=178.14000000000001s)]
*  businesses. Just yesterday we saw many of them shut down shops relatively [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=183.12s)]
*  early restaurants, gas stations, supply stores, all saying we're trying to make [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=188.5s)]
*  sure that our employees can get home safely. But you pointed out that major [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=193.28s)]
*  corridor I 10 100 miles of so west of where we are all shut down so that crews [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=197.52s)]
*  can properly treat the roads and do what it is that they need to do. And [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=204.20000000000002s)]
*  remember, there isn't exactly salt and brine mixture in surplus here. And so [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=207.22s)]
*  they're using sand to try to treat many of these roadways here doing the best [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=212.44s)]
*  that they can, especially concerned about those elevated roads, those [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=216.84s)]
*  bridges, those high roads leading up to the interstate that could potentially [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=220.1s)]
*  get really slick, especially as the conditions continue to drop here. And [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=224.34s)]
*  so they say that they will continue to try to treat this as a first issue [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=229.26s)]
*  first come basis, trying to maintain safety for everyone involved. We have [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=233.78s)]
*  seen D. O. T. Cruise up and down this major roadway here, one of the on ramps [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=238.36s)]
*  onto I 10. But we should also point out again that they say that if you do not [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=243.66s)]
*  have to be on these roads, do not come out here because they are continuing to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=248.38s)]
*  try to do their work. Still states of emergency in certain parts of Georgia [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=252.98s)]
*  and Florida and specific counties because of the icy conditions. And then, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=257.22s)]
*  oh yeah, not to mention there is the concern surrounding power outages. We [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=261.14s)]
*  know that there are tens of thousands of them not only here in Florida, but [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=265.06s)]
*  Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana. So yeah, the snow can be fun, but the South [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=268.22s)]
*  certainly dealing with the impacts of what comes after. Sure, those power [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=272.78000000000003s)]
*  outages could be lack of heat for a lot of folks who rely on that for their heat. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=276.22s)]
*  Skylar Henry, I'm sure you woke up thinking I did not sign up for this. I'm [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=280.46s)]
*  in the south. I'm not used to these types of conditions. Try to stay warm, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=284.38s)]
*  but but I thought that was so interesting that they're using sand [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=288.38s)]
*  instead of salt. They're sort of using what they got to help try to help with [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=291.34000000000003s)]
*  these conditions. You gotta do something. You gotta do something. This is [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=294.98s)]
*  historic areas down there haven't seen snow since the 1800s. So like it's in [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=297.74s)]
*  certain pockets, of course, and this is record breaking to in mobile over a [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=302.46000000000004s)]
*  New Orleans all the way over into Houston. We broke records just yesterday [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=305.9s)]
*  and now that that storm is moving offshore, what's left behind is just [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=309.85999999999996s)]
*  some cold, dense air on the back end. So let's break this apart throughout the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=313.58s)]
*  past 24 hours. We watched this major snow event impact communities from [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=317.02s)]
*  Houston all the way into the Carolinas with anywhere from 48 inches of snow. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=320.82s)]
*  It was an amazing system that swept through, causing some road closures [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=324.97999999999996s)]
*  inevitably, of course, school and work delayed or canceled. And here's what's [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=329.5s)]
*  happening for us today. We're out telling all those numbers up. We got [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=334.1s)]
*  over seven inches in areas like mobile. We got three inches in Houston. And as [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=337.66s)]
*  we take a look at what's to come, well, now it's just cold, dense air on the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=341.66s)]
*  back end that's gonna bring in temperatures still around 30 degrees [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=345.42s)]
*  below average today in areas like New Orleans all the way over into northern [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=348.02000000000004s)]
*  portions of Florida to along the panhandle. Now we take our eyes up to [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=352.26000000000005s)]
*  the Great Lakes. And what's happening now is interesting. Now we're seeing [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=356.6s)]
*  this lake effect snow linger into our thursday forecast anywhere from 4 to 10 [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=360.1s)]
*  inches of snow is expected for us throughout the Great Lakes, anywhere [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=363.7s)]
*  from Michigan all the way over into northern parts of Ohio, Pennsylvania [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=366.7s)]
*  and of course upstate New York to it's gonna be a very impressive next 24 [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=370.34s)]
*  hours up there. They're getting their fair share of snow while all of our [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=373.86s)]
*  friends down south are playing with theirs. And then once we head into the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=376.74s)]
*  next couple days, really what's gonna happen is we're still holding on tight [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=379.78s)]
*  to cool weather. It'll change as we head into this weekend. We'll see a little [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=382.98s)]
*  bit warmer conditions, but 30 degrees below average a day after they just [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=386.58s)]
*  received snow. It is still chilly down there and a little bit of a mess. If [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=390.70000000000005s)]
*  you ask me, yeah, and I think when things start to warm up to, they're [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=394.42s)]
*  gonna have to deal with some of that snow melt. So it's fun now, but I think [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=397.02000000000004s)]
*  they're gonna have a bit of a cleanup. Yeah, lots of pros, lots of cons. Thank [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=400.54s)]
*  you, Jess. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBowqVTfB4&t=404.58000000000004s)]
