# What to expect from Trump's address to joint session of Congress
**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU)
*  President Trump has paused all U.S. military aid for Ukraine following Friday's contentious Oval Office meeting with President Vladimir Zelensky. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=0.0s)]
*  He says the order will stay in effect until Ukraine is ready for peace talks with Russia. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=8.0s)]
*  And the president's tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China went into effect early this morning. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=13.0s)]
*  Canada and China wasted no time in announcing retaliatory tariffs of their own. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=18.0s)]
*  And we have a live look at Capitol Hill for you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=24.0s)]
*  This is the stage tonight where President Trump will address Congress. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=26.0s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson invited him to outline his vision for the next four years. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=30.0s)]
*  And we have team coverage for you on this this morning. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=35.0s)]
*  CBS News congressional reporter Torian Small is tracking what lawmakers are saying about the address. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=38.0s)]
*  But let's begin with CBS News Chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=43.0s)]
*  Nancy, what major themes can we expect from President Trump tonight? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=48.0s)]
*  Hey, Arrows, great to see you. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=53.0s)]
*  Well, the overarching theme, we're told, of this address is going to be the renewal of the American dream. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=55.0s)]
*  So President Trump, you can surmise, is going to argue that now that he is back in office, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=61.0s)]
*  he is going to usher in a return to the American dream in which all Americans can get ahead if they work hard. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=66.0s)]
*  There are a few themes on top of that that his aides say that he wants to hit on tonight. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=75.0s)]
*  First of all, they say he's going to talk about what he's accomplished so far in just over a month of his second term as president. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=82.0s)]
*  They'll talk. He'll talk about what he's doing for the economy, they say, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=90.0s)]
*  and what he wants to do on border security and when it comes to his plans for peace in Ukraine. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=94.0s)]
*  The economy will be a tricky one for him because some economic metrics that he likes to tout in particular [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=102.0s)]
*  have actually deteriorated a little bit over the past month, month and a half. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=111.0s)]
*  Just yesterday, for example, when he announced his tariffs on Canada and Mexico, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=116.0s)]
*  which will be going into effect, which actually are already in effect at this hour, went into effect at midnight, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=122.0s)]
*  the Dow tumbled 650 points. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=128.0s)]
*  And President Trump argues, and I'm sure we'll argue in his State of the Union tonight, that that pain will be short lived. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=130.0s)]
*  But many economists are predicting that this is going to lead to higher prices for just about everything [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=138.0s)]
*  because Canada and Mexico are our largest trading partners. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=144.0s)]
*  And Nancy, as you will know, when presidents have the command of the attention of Congress and the nation, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=148.0s)]
*  they typically invite guests to help bullet point some of the themes that they make. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=153.0s)]
*  What do we know about who the president has invited to be his guests tonight? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=158.0s)]
*  Well, we have confirmed that Elon Musk, the billionaire who is for all intents and purposes running the Doge operation, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=162.0s)]
*  will be here at the Capitol tonight. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=170.0s)]
*  President Trump will make the case for Doge and argue that this sometimes chaotic process of shrinking the size of government [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=173.0s)]
*  is going to be better for Americans in the long term. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=181.0s)]
*  We've also been told that he has invited a steel worker from Alabama, a union auto worker from Michigan. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=186.0s)]
*  So he will likely make the case that his policies are going to be better for them than his predecessors were. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=194.0s)]
*  I'm sure that list is going to grow throughout the day as we learn about more individuals that he is inviting [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=201.0s)]
*  who will be sitting with the First Lady. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=207.0s)]
*  But they tend to kind of dole that out over the course of the day to drum up excitement about the address to come. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=209.0s)]
*  All right, Nancy, great to see you. Thanks for that update from Capitol Hill. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=215.0s)]
*  You got it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=219.0s)]
*  Let's cross over to Torian Small and our D.C. Bureau now for more on this. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=220.0s)]
*  Torian, we know that some Republican lawmakers have had some pretty contentious town halls across the country. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=223.0s)]
*  Democrats are eager to get a counterpunch in tonight. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=229.0s)]
*  So what are congressional lawmakers saying ahead of this address? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=232.0s)]
*  Well, many of them are looking to them being Democrats, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=235.0s)]
*  but many of them are also looking to underscore the fact that Donald Trump has pretty much caused this intense public backlash for these Republican lawmakers. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=239.0s)]
*  Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said that he'll be skipping out on the speech tonight in favor of hosting his own virtual town hall, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=248.0s)]
*  rubbing it in to Republicans who are seeing quite a bit of blowback there. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=257.0s)]
*  But we're also hearing from some Senate Republicans who are a bit cautious about Donald Trump's impact so far. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=262.0s)]
*  Senator Susan Collins of Maine said that just yesterday that she is a bit wary about these tariffs before they were implemented in Canada, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=269.0s)]
*  saying that it's one of her state's largest trading partners. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=278.0s)]
*  So she's looking forward to see how the president addressed that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=282.0s)]
*  She's also a bit concerned about relations with Ukraine. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=285.0s)]
*  She was just told the news yesterday as it came down that aid to Ukraine is stopping, she said. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=289.0s)]
*  At this critical point, the U.S. can't do a move like that because it could tip the scales of the war with Russia. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=294.0s)]
*  Those are two people eyeing and looking for guidance from the president's speech tonight on how he's planning on moving forward for the rest of these four years. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=302.0s)]
*  And Turing, we know that Democrats have chosen first term senator Alyssa Slotkin from Michigan to give their official response to the president's address. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=311.0s)]
*  Tell us about who she is and why they've chosen her. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=320.0s)]
*  Yeah, Democratic leadership in this joint statement said that she is a rising star in this party. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=323.0s)]
*  She was a part of this very crucial battleground race in Michigan in 2024, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=330.0s)]
*  ultimately securing that seat and holding it down for Democrats in the Senate. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=335.0s)]
*  She's also a former CIA analyst. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=340.0s)]
*  She served as a DOD official, so she has this wealth of knowledge when it comes to national security and defense for the United States. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=344.0s)]
*  They're looking to contrast her experience, her time serving in the U.S. to what they're seeing as chaos caused by Donald Trump, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=353.0s)]
*  which is why they're choosing her in their minds as the rising star of the party to lead this response. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=363.0s)]
*  All right, Turing Small, thank you very much. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TOZiXT2HU&t=368.0s)]
