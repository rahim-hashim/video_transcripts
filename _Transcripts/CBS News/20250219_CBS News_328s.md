# Deadly small plane collision in Arizona, officials say
**CBS News:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY)
*  There's been another deadly aircraft collision this time in southern Arizona. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=0.0s)]
*  It happened about 20 miles north of Tucson at the Marana Regional Airport involving two [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=4.76s)]
*  smaller fixed-wing single-engine planes. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=10.36s)]
*  Preliminary information from the NTSB reveals the planes collided while going in the direction [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=14.56s)]
*  of the wind. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=18.8s)]
*  Officials say at least two people are dead. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=19.8s)]
*  It appears a total of four people were involved, two people on each plane. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=22.68s)]
*  I want to bring in Michael McCormick. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=26.68s)]
*  He's an associate professor and program coordinator at Air Traffic Management. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=28.040000000000003s)]
*  Thank you so much, Michael, for being here. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=31.68s)]
*  What can you tell us first of all about this area and this airport in particular? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=33.96s)]
*  Marana, Arizona is a small community in southern Arizona, and the airport is about 15 miles [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=38.88s)]
*  northwest of Marana. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=48.88s)]
*  It is a small airport with two runways, one relatively small and one twice the size. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=51.8s)]
*  It is what is known as an uncontrolled airport, meaning that there is no air traffic control [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  tower at the airport. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=63.76s)]
*  But looking back over the safety history of the airport, there has been no reports of [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=66.52s)]
*  any previous collisions at the airport. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=71.44s)]
*  The aircraft operating under what's known as visual flight rules and a traffic pattern [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=74.84s)]
*  within the airport, because it is uncontrolled, the aircraft actually talk to each other [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=80.88s)]
*  on what's known as the common traffic advisory frequency or CTAAF. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=87.8s)]
*  And that's how they share what they're going to do and how they're going to do it as they [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=92.6s)]
*  operate in and around the airport. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  Michael, is it typical for a smaller or regional airport to be, as you say, uncontrolled to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=98.6s)]
*  not have air traffic control towers? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=103.36s)]
*  That is not unusual at all. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=107.08s)]
*  Or much, the small, low volume, generally, aviation airports generally do not have their [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=108.64s)]
*  traffic control towers. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  What can you tell us about these two planes that were involved? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  What do you know about the aircraft? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=120.48s)]
*  What we know so far, and this is very preliminary information, that one is a Cessna Skyhawk, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=123.08000000000001s)]
*  which is a Cessna 172, which is a high wing aircraft, meaning that the wing is on top [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=130.32s)]
*  of the fuselage. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  The other aircraft is a Lanser 320, and that is an aircraft that is a kit-built aircraft. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=138.6s)]
*  Of course, that may not be a factor in this at all. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=149.04s)]
*  But what may be a factor is that as a low wing aircraft, in other words, the wing is [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=152.88s)]
*  on the bottom of the aircraft. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=157.76s)]
*  And what happens is when you have a high wing aircraft below a low wing aircraft, they actually [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=161.0s)]
*  can't see each other because their wings will block their view of the other aircraft. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=167.84s)]
*  And unfortunately, that has been a cause of traffic, tragic accidents in the past. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=173.84s)]
*  Can you explain that a little bit further? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=178.76s)]
*  I don't quite understand. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  And for people who are sitting at home who may not know what a kit plane is, does that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  essentially mean that the person operating the plane builds it themselves? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=183.52s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=188.72s)]
*  There are some services that you can order and they will come assembled. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=190.0s)]
*  However, this kit plane is generally put together by the owner of the aircraft. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  And what I mean by the high wing, low wing is that think of yourself in an aircraft, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=201.56s)]
*  typically a commercial aircraft, and you're sitting over top of the wing. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=209.28s)]
*  That's a low wing aircraft. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=213.24s)]
*  You can look to your left or right out the window and you can't see the ground. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=214.60000000000002s)]
*  What do you do if you see the wind? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  So in fact, if there was another aircraft below you, you would not know. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=219.52s)]
*  And when you put a high wing aircraft into the mix underneath the low wing aircraft, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=223.44s)]
*  the pilot of the other aircraft could look up and not see the other aircraft because [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=228.16s)]
*  it's blocked by the wing. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=233.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=235.0s)]
*  Just an incredible insight that you're giving us. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm just trying to absorb it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=238.0s)]
*  I want to ask you about that preliminary information from the MTSB that I had mentioned, which [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=239.16s)]
*  reveals the planes collided while going in the direction of the wind. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  Can you help us understand what that means? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=247.6s)]
*  When an aircraft operates in an uncontrolled airport under visual flight rules, they will [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=251.88s)]
*  fly what's known as a pattern. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  And that pattern involves essentially a rectangle that goes around the airport and ends at the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=261.12s)]
*  runway. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=267.64s)]
*  And there's what's known as the upwind leg of that pattern, which is you're flying into [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=269.04s)]
*  the wind and then you fly in the box across wind. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=274.72s)]
*  And then you come and you fly into a downwind where you're flying with a tailwind. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=280.72s)]
*  When you come to the downwind, then you turn what's known as base, you square off the base, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=286.20000000000005s)]
*  then you come in on final and you come in and land at the runway. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=291.32000000000005s)]
*  And that pattern is commonly used all throughout airports around the world. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=295.76s)]
*  You're going to have to forgive me for my ignorance. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=300.91999999999996s)]
*  Does flying in the direction of the wind as it appears these aircraft were, does that [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=303.2s)]
*  mean downwind or does that mean upwind? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=307.56s)]
*  Does that mean with the flow of the wind or against the wind? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=310.28s)]
*  With the flow, against the flow of the wind would be the upwind. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=315.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=318.44s)]
*  The flow of the wind would be the downwind. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=319.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=321.76s)]
*  Thank you, Michael McCormack. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=322.76s)]
*  There's going to be a lot more to figure out on what went wrong here, but we appreciate your expertise. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D2qi_-d_IY&t=324.6s)]
