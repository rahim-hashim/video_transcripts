*  Elon Musk has to, and access he has to the personal information of Americans. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOUuzruFCiQ&t=65.04s)]
*  The newly formed task force is headed by billionaire Elon Musk, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOUuzruFCiQ&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  whom President Trump has given a directive to target multiple parts of the government. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOUuzruFCiQ&t=76.08s)]
