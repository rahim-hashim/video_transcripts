# Trump offering "deferred resignation" to government workers unwilling to return to office
**CBS News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw)
*  This morning, millions of federal workers are weighing a potentially life-changing decision, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=0.0s)]
*  a buyout offer from the Trump administration. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=7.16s)]
*  An email sent government-wide last night gives the nation's roughly 2 million civilian federal [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=10.28s)]
*  workers until next Thursday to decide whether to leave. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=14.68s)]
*  If they do resign, they'll retain all pay and benefits until September 30th. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=19.12s)]
*  Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, though, gave a stark warning over this offer from the president. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=23.44s)]
*  If you accept that offer and resign, he'll stiff you just like he stiffed the contractors. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=29.44s)]
*  He doesn't have any authority to do this. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=34.92s)]
*  Do not be fooled by this guy. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=38.0s)]
*  You were here before he was here and you'll be here after he was here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=41.24s)]
*  Meantime, a judge temporarily blocked the administration's attempt to freeze all federal [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=45.88s)]
*  grants and loans. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=51.0s)]
*  Now this move by the Trump administration, it caused chaos yesterday because it was unclear [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=52.64s)]
*  which groups would be affected. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=57.8s)]
*  That will remain on hold, the decision, at least through Monday night. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  But before the judge's ruling, some lawmakers weighed in on the president's decision. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=64.72s)]
*  77 million Americans elected President Trump to be a game changer and to figure out why [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=69.44s)]
*  we're wasting money. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=74.52s)]
*  So all he's asking to do is to pause some of this money that's being spent. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=75.52s)]
*  This is cruelty. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  This is lawlessness. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  This is a heist done on a national scale. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=83.52s)]
*  No matter how much he may believe he does, the president does not have the authority [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=87.8s)]
*  to ignore the law. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=93.44s)]
*  Now this all comes as CBS News has learned President Trump is expected to sign an executive [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=96.08s)]
*  order freeing up federal funding for school choice programs. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=101.44s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Natalie Brand is following every angle of this for us on Capitol Hill [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=105.8s)]
*  and joins us now. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=109.94s)]
*  Natalie, great to see you. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=110.94s)]
*  Help us understand this buyout offer to federal employees. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=112.94s)]
*  What are the key questions here? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=117.7s)]
*  Well, Errol, good morning to you. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=122.14s)]
*  Some are already raising questions about the legality. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=124.14s)]
*  And like many actions that we've seen over the past week, there's scrutiny and already [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=128.38s)]
*  pushback. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=133.85999999999999s)]
*  But what we know, as you detailed, this letter that went out to federal employees gives them [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=134.85999999999999s)]
*  until next week, really, February 8th, to make a decision as to whether they are going [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=140.9s)]
*  to voluntarily resign in September. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=146.54s)]
*  And that would exempt them for some of the new policies that the Trump administration [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=150.22s)]
*  wants to put in place, specifically return to work full time, five days a week in the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=155.26s)]
*  office. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=161.46s)]
*  The administration, a senior administration official told CBS News that it expects up [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=162.46s)]
*  to 10 percent of federal employees to quit. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=168.06s)]
*  So that could be around 200,000 federal employees, workers that we're talking about here. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=171.26s)]
*  The administration saying it just wants to boost standards in various federal agencies. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=178.26s)]
*  But the American Federation of Government Employees, that's the largest federal employees [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=184.14s)]
*  union criticizing this move, said in a statement in part, purging the federal government of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=188.54s)]
*  dedicated career civil servants will have vast unintended consequences. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=194.01999999999998s)]
*  Now note, this offer does not apply to military, national security, postal workers, immigration [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=199.73999999999998s)]
*  enforcement. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=209.06s)]
*  But as you noted, a lot of federal workers out there, around two million, have a big [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=210.06s)]
*  decision ahead of them. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=214.33999999999997s)]
*  And help us understand more about this pause in federal funding. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=216.1s)]
*  A federal judge has paused that going into effect. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=220.38s)]
*  I wonder if the Trump administration is expecting that, potentially something that could make [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=224.7s)]
*  its way to the Supreme Court. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=229.28s)]
*  Yeah, it did not take long for legal challenges to be filed. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  This is an issue like others that we've seen with the Trump administration that could end [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=236.44s)]
*  up all the way up to the U.S. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=240.72s)]
*  Supreme Court. But what we know is a coalition of nonprofits filed suit yesterday and a [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=243.12s)]
*  federal judge here in Washington granted this temporary stay, temporary pause on [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=249.68s)]
*  this memo from being enacted while she weighs these arguments more fully. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  As you know, Errol, yesterday, this White House budget office memo really set off triggered [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=262.44s)]
*  mass confusion and concern nationwide. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=269.88s)]
*  And lawmakers here on Capitol Hill across both sides of the aisle say that they were [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=273.24s)]
*  fielding calls from constituents talking about potential disruptions, really confused [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  by what this all meant. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=285.48s)]
*  Programs from Head Start to Meals on Wheels, other nonprofits wondering whether they would [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  be impacted and really having a hard time sorting out what the very broad memo meant. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=292.32s)]
*  As we discussed yesterday, it directed agencies to review discretionary funding to make sure [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=300.0s)]
*  it was in line with the president's priorities. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=305.52000000000004s)]
*  But again, lawsuits filed not only that nonprofit coalition, but a group of Democratic [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=308.52000000000004s)]
*  attorneys general filed suit calling this unconstitutional, saying the power of the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=314.48s)]
*  purse rests with Congress. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=319.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the dust certainly being kicked up there in the nation's capital. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=321.4s)]
*  Natalie Brand with the latest. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=324.32s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUODrWPe_Aw&t=325.56s)]
