**CBS News:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8)
*  Breaking news FBI agents have filed a lawsuit over the US Justice Department's efforts to identify agents who are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=0.0s)]
*  participated in investigations related to January 6th and this comes as we're on watch for a potential major shakeup of the FBI [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=7.9s)]
*  Now a reminder FBI employees across the country were directed yesterday to turn in a questionnaire to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=16.54s)]
*  supervisors about their possible work on January 6th cases [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=23.7s)]
*  Supervisors collected the questionnaires and today is the deadline to hand that information over to the Justice Department [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=28.54s)]
*  Joining us now is CBS News Department of Justice correspondent Scott McFarland Scott [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=35.18s)]
*  Thank you so much for being with us first and foremost [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=39.34s)]
*  Talk about the gravity of this targeted questionnaire and what it really means for these FBI agents [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=42.66s)]
*  There's a concern that this will have a chilling effect on the FBI and its agents for the near future if not for the long-term [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=49.62s)]
*  future of the FBI that they're being questioned and scrutinized for their roles in the January 6th investigation is sending a message [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=56.62s)]
*  That they have to be careful what investigation they take next that they may have to be careful not to take a case that they [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=64.62s)]
*  displease President Trump so no matter if there are mass firings mass resignations or not [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=70.62s)]
*  A bell has already been rung that they can't unring now what will happen next will there be large-scale employment actions [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=75.62s)]
*  the showing of the door to many of the FBI agents to find that out in the hours and days to come do know from our CBS News [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=82.62s)]
*  reporting there are potentially thousands of FBI employees and agents impacted by this review this January 6th [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=91.62s)]
*  investigation was no small thing and it was not isolated to Washington DC this was a national investigation involving nearly every [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=99.62s)]
*  US state all FBI field offices and that yielded 1500 plus defendants so a lot of agents have their fingerprints on these cases [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=106.62s)]
*  and the more pressing concern right now is what challenges can be mustered and galvanized to stop or slow down any type of removal [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=115.62s)]
*  there's a lawsuit just filed by nine anonymous FBI employees trying to challenge the gathering of these names and any actions by [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=124.62s)]
*  the Department of Justice they say among other things this is a violation of their rights of their privacy and what's more [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=132.62s)]
*  they argue this list of employees who handle January 6 cases is potentially a piece of nitroglycerin if it falls into the wrong hands [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=139.62s)]
*  it's a national security concern and these employees could be subjected to threats and to be clear Scott do FBI agents have a choice [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=148.62s)]
*  as to what case they're they're given to investigate and I mean are these employees essentially being investigated for doing their jobs [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=157.62s)]
*  that's what the advocates and the legal representatives of these FBI employees are saying that FBI agents were doing their job [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=166.62s)]
*  they were taking assignments doing them diligently and for my four years of covering the January 6 prosecutions there was not one occasion where a judge [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=175.62s)]
*  laid a glove on what the FBI agents and employees did in the field there was no question raised in the courts or adjudicated in the courts that showed [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=183.62s)]
*  misconduct by the FBI that would warrant disciplinary actions they're simply surveying these employees to find out if they did any interviews [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=192.62s)]
*  did they do any arrests did they do any searches that's the blocking and tackling of investigative work this is what FBI agents are supposed to do [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=201.62s)]
*  right so what could happen next and if this purge happens is this a threat to public safety [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=211.62s)]
*  the removal of FBI agents short of disciplinary reasons short of significant cause is going to thin out the FBI agents and the FBI agents [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=219.62s)]
*  to a certain extent because it's going to thin out FBI field offices nationwide potentially there are big task forces these January 6th lead agents have [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=229.62s)]
*  as the rest of their jobs some of them are on the violent crimes task force some of them help pursuit child sex predators an awful lot of them according to our CBS News review [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=241.62s)]
*  are part of joint terrorism task forces and communities nationwide these are agents that served from Chicago to Colorado California [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=250.62s)]
*  in New York, Texas, they would be winnowing out some pretty significant units inside the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=258.62s)]
*  Bureau. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=265.9s)]
*  Yeah, there's a trickle down effect to all of this. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=266.9s)]
*  Scott McFarland, thank you so much for that insight. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-jbLgLu_8&t=268.86s)]
