# Supreme Court will not stop Trump's New York "hush money" case sentencing
**CBS News:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k)
*  The Supreme Court has just announced that it is refusing the effort from Donald Trump's team [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=0.0s)]
*  to stay a decision on Trump's sentencing in his hush money criminal case here in New York, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=7.44s)]
*  scheduled for Friday. Again, the Supreme Court now refusing to stop former President Trump's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=14.4s)]
*  sentencing. The president-elect was scheduled to be sentenced after being found guilty on 34 [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=21.12s)]
*  felony counts for falsifying business records as it related to so-called hush money payments to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=28.0s)]
*  the former porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. You'll recall during the summer of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=34.32s)]
*  2024 during footage like this when the former president was coming to and from a criminal [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=40.96s)]
*  courtroom here in New York that he vehemently denied the allegations against him, but ultimately [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=47.28s)]
*  a jury of his peers found him guilty of falsifying business records and that preceded the election [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=54.4s)]
*  where most voters found that they still, most American voters found they still wanted him to [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=60.96s)]
*  become the next president of the United States. So it set up this highly unusual moment in American [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=65.28s)]
*  history where an incoming president would be sentenced in a criminal case in New York. So [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=72.16s)]
*  before Friday's sentencing, Donald Trump's legal team actually requested that the Supreme Court [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=78.48s)]
*  intervene and stop the sentencing on the grounds that the Supreme Court ruled that a president [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=84.56s)]
*  cannot be held accountable or even a former president for any actions that are part of an [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=91.04s)]
*  official act of a presidency. And so as we look into the decision from the Supreme Court, we can [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=96.56s)]
*  read you a portion of it now. And it essentially says that the application for stay has been denied [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=103.04s)]
*  and it says it's being denied for two reasons. First, and I'm quoting here, the alleged [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=110.64s)]
*  evidentiary violations at President-elect Trump's state court trial can be addressed in the ordinary [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  course on appeal. So the Supreme Court saying that it does not need to intervene in this sentencing [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=123.84s)]
*  because any of the issues that the president-elect has can be addressed on ordinary course on appeal. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=130.16s)]
*  The second reason the Supreme Court provides is that quote, the burden that sentencing will impose [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=138.24s)]
*  on the president-elect responsibilities is relatively insubstantial in light of the trial [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  court's stated intent to impose a sentence of unconditional discharge after a brief virtual [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=150.24s)]
*  hearing. Now that's a reference to the latest developments out of this criminal court in Manhattan [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=156.96s)]
*  where Judge Juan Murchon has said that it is likely that the sentence imposed on President-elect Trump [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=162.72s)]
*  will be what is described as an unconditional discharge. Moments ago on the Daily Report, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=170.32s)]
*  we had a conversation about what that means and it effectively means that Trump as someone who has [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=175.60000000000002s)]
*  no prior criminal record, no previous incidents, and of course being a man of high stature as a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=181.44s)]
*  former president and now as an incoming president wouldn't have been sentenced to jail time. You're [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=188.4s)]
*  seeing an image of Judge Juan Murchon here and so the Supreme Court is effectively saying that because [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  the punishment will be an unconditional discharge and because it estimates that Trump's concerns [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=200.8s)]
*  can be addressed on the normal course of appeal, it is now denying Trump's effort to have the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=208.32s)]
*  Supreme Court intervene. Our CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson joins us now with [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=215.6s)]
*  more on this. Jessica, after so many months of watching the trial and calling it unprecedented, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  moments before sentencing, this is a remarkable development but help us better understand [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=228.24s)]
*  this decision by the Supreme Court. Well, I think it's in some ways a non-decision. They're saying, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=234.8s)]
*  no, we're not going to take this up. We're not going to push pause. We're talking about a state [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=241.36s)]
*  criminal case and we know that you, President Trump, have asked us to intervene on frankly, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=246.88000000000002s)]
*  I think some somewhat creative theories that a president-elect is entitled to immunity in [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=253.68s)]
*  addition to a president and they, I think, very predictably decided not to get involved because [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=261.12s)]
*  there really is not a live federal question right now. This was an invitation for them to take up, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  I believe, an issue outside the scope of their previous decision. So as people know, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  President Trump was convicted in the Hush Money case. He is now set to be sentenced tomorrow [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=281.52s)]
*  morning. He had gone to the Supreme Court and other courts saying, pause this sentence, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=288.0s)]
*  don't sentence me. And part of his theory was that based on the Supreme Court's decision, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=293.36s)]
*  that presidents can enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution, that he as the president-elect should [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=299.36s)]
*  enjoy immunity from sentencing. So what then does this mean when it comes to sentencing come Friday? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=305.92s)]
*  They do note that Judge Juan-Mashon has indicated that the sentence will likely be an [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=314.48s)]
*  unconditional discharge. Help us better understand what that means and why the Supreme Court feels [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=319.68s)]
*  it's significant in this decision. Well, I think what we're looking at here is a sentence that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=324.8s)]
*  will feel to a lot of people, frankly, like a non-sentence. We do have somebody who is convicted [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=330.56s)]
*  of 34 felony counts. Now, let's remember that these were nonviolent felonies and in any situation, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=336.32s)]
*  any defendant might not face prison time based on a conviction like this. But add into that, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=342.48s)]
*  that we're talking about the past and future president and that inauguration is less than [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  two weeks away and there is basically no chance of jail time. All of which to say, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=355.44s)]
*  the sentence here will be a sentence that is a slap on the wrist. It will be a blemish. It will [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  be frankly nothing more than an acknowledgement that there was a conviction in this case. But I [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=366.96s)]
*  think for a lot of people, it will feel like there's no real practical consequence other than the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  fact that the president is a convicted felon and that that is now on his record. And so just to be [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=378.88s)]
*  clear, has president-elect Trump now with this decision run out of options to try and delay [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=384.79999999999995s)]
*  tomorrow morning sentencing? So I want to be careful here, but I believe that when it comes [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=391.12s)]
*  to both the federal system, he's gone to the top of the federal system. That's the US Supreme Court [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=398.08s)]
*  and he has also asked New York state courts to intervene as well. I believe that he has exhausted [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=403.76s)]
*  those appeals at this point. Now I'm being very careful here, one, because this is a occupational [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=410.4s)]
*  hazard of attorneys. We always hedge a little bit, but also because there always could be an [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=416.16s)]
*  eleventh hour filing. So I want to be careful, but it is seven thirty on the East Coast. Sentencing [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=424.24s)]
*  is happening tomorrow morning. I think sentencing is going ahead. I really do. And we do know that [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=430.56s)]
*  Trump has used every legal avenue available to him in every way, shape and form as it relates to this [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=435.12s)]
*  and the other former cases he was facing. Jessica, help us understand then what will happen come [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=441.36s)]
*  Friday morning if this is an unconditional discharge? Will the incoming president have a [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=448.24s)]
*  parole officer? What are likely to be the terms of a sentence? Well, I think an unconditional release [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=454.64s)]
*  means that there won't be conditions. So I do not believe that we are looking at a situation where, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=462.16s)]
*  again, we've ruled out jail time. We've ruled out things like parole. We've ruled out things [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=468.32s)]
*  like ankle bracelets. I think we have essentially ruled out any sort of limitations, and that is [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  because we're not talking about any other defendant. We are talking about somebody who is [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=482.4s)]
*  about to be the head of the executive branch. So in look, Judge Mershon has discretion to add [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=488.0s)]
*  conditions if he wants to, but unconditional, many things in the law aren't as they sound. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=496.08s)]
*  This is one of those situations where it typically is. It means that there are not strings attached. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=502.08s)]
*  When it comes to this case, I think for a little bit of context, this is not the type of case where [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=510.24s)]
*  you would typically see prison time, again, because it's a nonviolent felony. But we do have a situation [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=515.36s)]
*  where there were aggravating factors based on how the former president conducted himself [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=521.36s)]
*  and particularly attacks that he made on the judge and his staff. So I think in another world [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=526.48s)]
*  where maybe he was not reelected, there was the possibility of at least some small amount of prison [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=532.4s)]
*  time. That's a very far distance from what we will see tomorrow morning. It is 7.30 here on the East [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=537.52s)]
*  Coast. I'm Errol Barnett at the CBS broadcast center. I'm speaking with our legal contributor, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=544.0s)]
*  Jessica Levinson, on the breaking news that the Supreme Court has decided it will not stop [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=548.4s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump's sentencing scheduled to take place Friday as it relates to the guilty [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  verdict in his so-called hush money case. And Jessica, the Supreme Court in justifying its [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=561.28s)]
*  decision makes two points that the president-elect can address his concerns on the ordinary course of [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=569.36s)]
*  appeal. And it says it also reached this decision because of Judge Juan Mirchand's suggestion that [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=576.4s)]
*  Trump ultimately will be given an unconditional discharge, which you've helped us understand [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=584.48s)]
*  effectively. To most people, it would look like no punishment. Our Supreme Court correspondent, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=589.68s)]
*  Jan Crawford, also shares her interpretation of what the Supreme Court means in saying that in [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=598.9599999999999s)]
*  almost suggesting that Judge Mirchand should stick to his word. What do you make of that analysis of [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=605.68s)]
*  these two points? Exactly the same thing. Jan is the gold standard. She knows exactly what she is [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=612.4799999999999s)]
*  talking about. I think that is 100% correct that what the Supreme Court is really saying is you're [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=618.64s)]
*  very worried, it seems, that there will be some interference with the president's ability to do [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=625.68s)]
*  his job. But Judge Mirchand has said that there will be an unconditional release. So essentially, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=631.12s)]
*  what is the interference that you're concerned about? Why is it that we would need to get involved [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=637.44s)]
*  here? I'm really just repeating what Jan pointed out and a question that you asked me before, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=642.08s)]
*  which is I think that the Supreme Court's decision not to intervene is in part based on the idea that [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=647.2s)]
*  this will be a sentence that doesn't look much like the type of sentence we're used to. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=653.2s)]
*  I understand that we have not yet heard from President-elect Trump on this decision. We [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=659.12s)]
*  have some footage of Mar-a-Lago in West Palm Beach, Florida right now. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_C-opxm11k&t=663.68s)]
