# Rubio says "work remains" on ending Ukraine war after talks with Russia
**CBS News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM)
*  We're also learning more about the meeting between officials from the United States and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=0.0s)]
*  Russia, which happened just a few hours ago in Saudi Arabia at the top of the agenda, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=4.12s)]
*  bringing an end to the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Absent from that meeting, though, anybody, any officials from Kiev, Ukraine. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=9.72s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio was optimistic following the hours-long meeting, but he cautioned [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=16.16s)]
*  that the process will take some time. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=19.96s)]
*  We're not going to pre-negotiate an end to this conflict. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=23.2s)]
*  These are the kinds of things that have to happen through hard and difficult diplomacy [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=27.52s)]
*  and closed rooms over a period of time. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=30.84s)]
*  We have to understand that it's been three and a half years since there's been any sort [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=32.88s)]
*  of regularized contact between the United States and Russia, and in some cases between [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=36.12s)]
*  any of the participants in this conflict and Russia. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=41.28s)]
*  So the goal of today's meeting was to follow up on the phone call the president had a week [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=44.36s)]
*  ago and begin to establish those lines of communication. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=47.96s)]
*  The work remains. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  All right, CBS News' senior foreign correspondent, Holly Williams, who has covered the war in [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=53.72s)]
*  Ukraine since the very beginning, is joining me now live from London. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=58.04s)]
*  So Holly, are Secretary Rubio and the other U.S. delegates who attended this meeting reporting [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  any progress being made when it comes to ending that war? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=67.06s)]
*  And I think more importantly, what kind of progress can be decided if you don't actually [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=70.36s)]
*  have Ukrainian officials at the table? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=74.64s)]
*  Good morning, Vlad. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the two sides agreed to appoint high-level [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=78.36s)]
*  teams to try and end the war in Ukraine in a way that is, quote, enduring and acceptable [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=83.32s)]
*  to all sides. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=88.68s)]
*  Now, as you'll remember, during the presidential campaign, President Trump repeatedly claimed [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=89.88s)]
*  that he could end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=94.7s)]
*  That obviously hasn't happened. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=97.84s)]
*  But what we're now seeing is some really high-speed diplomacy. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=99.16s)]
*  And for the Russians, arguably, just having this meeting today, having a phone call last [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=103.02s)]
*  week between President Trump and Vladimir Putin that apparently lasted nearly 90 minutes, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=108.32s)]
*  is already a kind of victory in itself, because Russia has been so isolated from the West [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=113.16s)]
*  by sanctions and condemnation for nearly three years now. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=119.16s)]
*  Many Ukrainians, though, feel that they've been betrayed. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=122.88s)]
*  Their president, Vladimir Zelensky, said yesterday that his government, quote, will not recognize [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=125.91999999999999s)]
*  any agreement about us made without us. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  And that seems to call into question the very legitimacy of these negotiations. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=134.96s)]
*  Rubio, though, pushed back at that today, saying that the world should be thanking President [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=139.52s)]
*  Trump. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=144.88s)]
*  So, as you know, Holly, there was a meeting of European officials that happened in Paris. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=145.88s)]
*  And I also should note that the UK Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, put on the table the possibility [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=153.24s)]
*  of having British troops in Ukraine serving as peacekeepers, but also implore the United [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  States to take part in that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=163.84s)]
*  My question would be, why wouldn't Europe just try to go at it alone? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=165.32000000000002s)]
*  If the United States is not a key partner or a reliable partner in what is happening [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=168.76000000000002s)]
*  on the ground in Europe, as evidenced by the notion that all of a sudden these sanctions [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=173.84s)]
*  that were put in place because Vladimir Putin violated international law and invaded his [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=178.38000000000002s)]
*  neighbor, you're now being rewarded by removing those sanctions, engaging in discussions with [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=184.12s)]
*  the Russians and not the Ukrainians. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=189.44s)]
*  Why wouldn't the Europeans say, look, we might have to go at this alone to protect [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=192.02s)]
*  ourselves, should Putin decide to do the same thing, given that there are no repercussions [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=195.62s)]
*  to other countries? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=199.98000000000002s)]
*  I think the short answer to that is that the U.S. is still the most powerful country in [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=201.58s)]
*  the world, with the most powerful military in the world. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=204.9s)]
*  And Europeans believe that they need the U.S.'s support to help shore up their own security. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=207.44s)]
*  Look, European leaders held an emergency meeting yesterday in Paris, clearly worried about [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=213.66000000000003s)]
*  being excluded from these negotiations. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=219.14000000000001s)]
*  Remember that Europe, like the U.S., has committed tens of billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=221.9s)]
*  throughout this war. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=228.26000000000002s)]
*  As you pointed out, the British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, says he would contribute troops [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=229.58s)]
*  to a peacekeeping force in Ukraine if a ceasefire deal is agreed. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=234.26000000000002s)]
*  But he also said, quote, there must be a U.S. backstop because a U.S. security guarantee [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=238.5s)]
*  is the only way to effectively deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=244.22000000000003s)]
*  That is the fear in Europe, that a ceasefire could be agreed that effectively allows Putin [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=249.3s)]
*  to regroup and then reinvade Ukraine in the future. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=254.26000000000002s)]
*  Starmer will be in Washington next week to talk about that and other things with President Trump. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=258.62s)]
*  And finally, Holly, there was also discussion of President Trump's promises to meet with [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=264.06s)]
*  Vladimir Putin at some point himself. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=268.22s)]
*  Again, the image that that sends to the world, perhaps in the United States, they'll spin [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=271.46000000000004s)]
*  it as negotiating to end the war in Ukraine. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=275.82000000000005s)]
*  But if you are a former Soviet state now independent, perhaps even one of those former Soviet states [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=279.54s)]
*  that are now members of NATO, what kind of a message does it send to show the president [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=285.5s)]
*  of the United States sitting with Vladimir Putin given what he has done over the course [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=290.22s)]
*  of the last three years in Ukraine? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=294.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, look, we're expecting a summit meeting at some point between President Trump and [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=295.82000000000005s)]
*  Vladimir Putin, perhaps also in Saudi Arabia. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  But we don't have any timing. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=302.58000000000004s)]
*  We have the talks today. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=304.06s)]
*  Vladimir Putin's foreign policy adviser, who was part of those talks, said it is unlikely [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=305.06s)]
*  that summit would happen next week. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=310.94s)]
*  But we have nothing beyond that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=312.70000000000005s)]
*  Look, critics of the Trump administration's approach would say that a summit would be [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=314.22s)]
*  yet another coup for Vladimir Putin. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=319.18s)]
*  All right, Holly Williams, thank you so much for your clarity, your analysis and of course [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=322.38s)]
*  your reporting as always. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=326.78000000000003s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=327.86s)]
*  OK, let's bring in CBS News White House reporter Olivia Varnoldi for more on today's [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=328.86s)]
*  meeting with Ukraine, those officials with regards to Ukraine, those officials discussing [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=333.86s)]
*  Ukraine's future, including the Russians and the United States, but the Ukrainians [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=339.78000000000003s)]
*  not president, not president. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=343.46000000000004s)]
*  How does the White House view these meetings with regards to the progress being made towards [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=345.58000000000004s)]
*  any kind of a peaceful resolution to this conflict, Olivia? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=350.0s)]
*  Well, Varnoldi, it's good to be with you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=353.1s)]
*  It certainly is a signal that they're sending that the Ukrainians are not at the table for [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=355.02000000000004s)]
*  this specific meeting. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=358.74s)]
*  Vice President Vance met with Zelensky last week in Munich and the sidelines of that security [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=361.1s)]
*  conference. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=365.62s)]
*  But these are very fast moving talks between both sides that they're having. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=366.62s)]
*  We know Secretary Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, as well as National Security Adviser [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=371.64000000000004s)]
*  Mike Walz are there having those conversations with them. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=377.42s)]
*  But it is notable that Ukraine is not at the table. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=380.90000000000003s)]
*  I suspect from sources I've talked to that what they're doing, the U.S. is doing right [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=383.26000000000005s)]
*  now, is really feeling out both sides. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=386.66s)]
*  Where can they actually get an agreement to really end the war in Ukraine, something [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=389.02s)]
*  Trump has talked about? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=394.74s)]
*  Secretary Rubio, at the end of that meeting they had there, said that he said no one is [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=395.74s)]
*  being sidelined here and that Trump is trying to do what he promised, which is to bring [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=400.02s)]
*  peace. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=403.34s)]
*  But again, notable that they're not part of that conversation. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=404.34s)]
*  We also did just get a wire report that just came across that Ukraine's President Zelensky [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=407.21999999999997s)]
*  is no longer going to Saudi Arabia because some reports say that he wants to avoid his [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=411.97999999999996s)]
*  visit being linked to any sort of U.S.-Russia talks, so peace talks that he was not a part [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=417.34000000000003s)]
*  of. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=422.86s)]
*  So all of this happening very quickly. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=423.86s)]
*  We know there's a lot of deals on the table that the Trump administration would like to [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=425.22s)]
*  put forth in Ukraine, particularly related to their critical minerals. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=428.58s)]
*  We know last week, especially in Munich, that there was a conversation about getting access [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=432.86s)]
*  to those minerals as part of a potential security peace deal between the U.S. and Ukraine. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=436.7s)]
*  So a lot of fast moving conversations happening. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=441.66s)]
*  So removing those sanctions that we placed on Russia because of its illegal invasion [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=444.98s)]
*  of Ukraine, thereby rewarding them, but twisting Zelensky's arm to provide the United States [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=450.70000000000005s)]
*  with some crucial natural resources. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=455.58000000000004s)]
*  And of course, as you heard, Holly, Olivia, President Trump promised to end the war in [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=458.04s)]
*  Ukraine in 24 hours. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=462.82s)]
*  Hasn't happened. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=464.90000000000003s)]
*  Did they establish a timeline for when they would like to see all of this take place? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=465.90000000000003s)]
*  It's actually something I asked at the end of the Zelensky advance meeting that occurred [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=470.38s)]
*  a shouted question I threw at them, Reynat Zelensky. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=474.14000000000004s)]
*  No answer on them. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=476.74s)]
*  But I did ask, what is the time frame for all of this? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=477.74s)]
*  Of course, we're just several weeks into the Trump administration. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=480.3s)]
*  This is a major focus of theirs ending this war. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=483.20000000000005s)]
*  But if there's no peace by summer, is that a failure by all sides? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=486.70000000000005s)]
*  Of course, this war is now dragging into its third year with major losses of life on both [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=490.94000000000005s)]
*  sides, trillions or millions and billions of dollars spent on aid in here. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=494.70000000000005s)]
*  What does this all actually look like? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=501.18s)]
*  What is the timeline for it? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=502.34s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=503.34s)]
*  Let me ask you about this, Olivia. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=504.34s)]
*  The FAA has fired hundreds of employees as the federal government continues to trim jobs. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=506.46s)]
*  Of course, the Federal Aviation Administration. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=510.7s)]
*  Who were among the cuts? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=513.5799999999999s)]
*  How is the transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, responding? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=515.62s)]
*  I saw a couple of posts on X from the former transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=518.5799999999999s)]
*  also sort of wondering the very same things that we're asking here. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=524.62s)]
*  What is the current secretary of transportation saying? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=528.16s)]
*  Well, look, this is a precarious moment in air travel. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=530.58s)]
*  Let's just set that straight. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=533.5s)]
*  There has been a lot of incidents happening across the country in Canada. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=534.5s)]
*  The incident that we saw yesterday, all eyes are on the airline industry. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=540.34s)]
*  So it's notable that the FAA did begin firing some several hundred employees, and they include [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=543.6600000000001s)]
*  system specialists, safety instructors, maintenance mechanics, administrative staff, and more [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=549.26s)]
*  of those people. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=554.9200000000001s)]
*  And you mentioned that pushback from secretary, former secretary Pete Buttigieg, who said [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=555.9200000000001s)]
*  that this isn't the moment to be firing some of those critical workers. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=559.7s)]
*  Sean Duffy, who is the transportation secretary, fired back and he said less than 400 were [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=562.86s)]
*  let go and they were all probationary, meaning that they had been hired less than a year [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=567.22s)]
*  ago. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=570.6600000000001s)]
*  And he said that no air traffic controllers, zero air traffic controllers or critical safety [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=571.6600000000001s)]
*  personnel were part of the firings. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=575.38s)]
*  As you know, and as I know, there is a critical shortage of air traffic controllers in this [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=578.3000000000001s)]
*  country and it is becoming a problem. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=583.46s)]
*  And it's something that this next administration is inheriting. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=586.08s)]
*  So there's a lot of finger pointing going on on X, certainly some movement we're seeing [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=589.48s)]
*  from the FAA on this. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=593.8000000000001s)]
*  We'll be interested to see how this impacts the coming weeks going forward. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=595.72s)]
*  All right, Olivia Renaldi reporting for us from Washington today. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=599.24s)]
*  Thank you, Olivia. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIp5Lg4utM&t=602.9200000000001s)]
