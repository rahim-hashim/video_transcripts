*  nuclear weapons everybody from the ICJ I was sitting here quietly and now I'm being manhandled [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  by two or three people. You're pontificate about a free press you pontificate about a free press [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=53.04s)]
*  you are hurting me you are hurting me you are hurting me. I am asking questions after being [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=61.2s)]
*  told by Matt Miller that he will not answer my questions. Please sir respect the respect the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=66.96s)]
*  process we'll have an opportunity to take questions in a few minutes. Wasn't the point of the May 31st [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=72.48s)]
*  statement to block the ICJ orders? He blocked the ICJ orders? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=79.12s)]
*  Please sir respect the process thank you. Respect the process. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=84.4s)]
*  Respect the process. Well everybody everybody from the from the International [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=87.36s)]
*  from the International to the ICJ saying that is well doing genocide and extermination and you're [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  telling me to respect the process. Criminal why are you in the Hague? Why are you in the Hague? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  So tense here in the United States but also some tensions in the Middle East. CBS News foreign [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=105.36s)]
*  correspondent Remy Innocentio joins us now from Tel Aviv. Remy this is really just one example of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=112.0s)]
*  how emotionally charged this conflict has been. Being in Israel right now what are you hearing [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=118.24s)]
*  from the families of the hostages as we're starting to see what feels like almost a walk [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=123.6s)]
*  back to the surety that this deal can get done. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=129.04s)]
*  Right Reid well listening to the anger and the desperation in that person's voice here at [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  Hostage Square there is anxiety and desperation as we have just in the past hour gotten word [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  that Israel's government is going to go ahead with those meetings to push that hostage and [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=148.56s)]
*  ceasefire deal through the approval process tomorrow but with the hostage families that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  we have been talking to here at Hostage Square and in the past day since that deal was announced [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  there is a mix of anxious hope but also fear that this deal still will not get across the finish [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=165.28s)]
*  line. Remember even though the deal was announced the deal has not yet been signed it has not yet [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=173.28s)]
*  been approved. Many people here point out that we've been here before and pointing out that there [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=179.84s)]
*  are so many different points where this could still derail you know we thought that we would have the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  approval from the cabinet ministers today it did not happen it's expected to happen tomorrow and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=193.6s)]
*  we are now told that the first hostages will now come out on Sunday. Every single day something [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=199.12s)]
*  is very different and that has been the I guess the reality here for the past 467 days here at [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=206.16s)]
*  Hostage Square you probably have seen it before but there is a count up clock right around us. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=212.24s)]
*  It says 467 days it has been counting up for the whole entire past 15 months. This has been the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=218.0s)]
*  anxiety that people here in Israel have been living through and the idea that hopefully allowing [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=223.2s)]
*  themselves to hope is also something fearful because they don't want to do that but if there [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=229.2s)]
*  was ever time that they could hope this is the time that they're allowing them to do that. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=233.84s)]
*  Rami it's so helpful to have you right there where the news is breaking and playing out in real time. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=238.08s)]
*  Are you getting a sense of what the sticking points could be that are being discussed behind [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=243.36s)]
*  closed doors today in advance of that anticipated vote tomorrow? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=247.44s)]
*  Sure from Israeli media not confirmable by CBS News but from Israeli media they were talking [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=255.12s)]
*  about an issue regarding the identities of the Palestinian detainees who might be who could be [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=261.92s)]
*  released from Israeli prisons here. The idea here is that Hamas and Israel apparently had agreed [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=270.72s)]
*  that some of these detainees would be off limits but then the office of the prime minister said [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=277.76s)]
*  that instead Hamas was trying to have an effective veto trying to guide who they could get. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=284.72s)]
*  My take on it is that it could possibly be a demand of high value detainees, high profile [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=292.32s)]
*  detainees who perhaps were past activists, past leaders of Hamas and who could still be if [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=300.72s)]
*  allowed out could then be future militants. That's just my take but now we know that we are beyond [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=307.36s)]
*  this. The reportable news right now is that the approval process will happen and we're expecting [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=313.36s)]
*  that to happen tomorrow. We know you'll be there when it does and you'll break it right here on [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=319.76s)]
*  CBS News 24 7. Remy Innocencio thank you so much for that report. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llotUWL5w0&t=323.84000000000003s)]
