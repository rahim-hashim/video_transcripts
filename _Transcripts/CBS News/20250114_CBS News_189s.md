# Trump allies reacting to Hegseth's Senate confirmation hearing
**CBS News:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk)
*  For more on the president-elect's response to today's confirmation hearings, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=0.0s)]
*  we turn to CBS News political reporter Olivia Rinaldi with the Trump team in [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=3.84s)]
*  West Palm Beach, Florida. So Olivia, how closely is Trump watching these [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=7.2s)]
*  confirmation hearings and do we know yet how we think Hegseth did today? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=10.4s)]
*  Yeah, good to be with you, Lindsay. We know Trump is watching these hearings very [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=15.0s)]
*  closely today. Early this morning we heard from him on True Social wishing [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=18.8s)]
*  Hegseth good luck and saying that he has his total support. We're starting to see [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  some reaction trickle out from Trump allies and advisors so far through social [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=28.36s)]
*  media posts on X about how they felt Hegseth did today. By and large, people, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  the reactions were very positive. Some people, even Charlie Kirk, saying that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  they like Hegseth even more, not that they've watched him on Capitol Hill kind [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=44.44s)]
*  of battling it out with some of these Democratic senators. So it seems that he [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=49.959999999999994s)]
*  has the support of the MAGA base of Trump, especially after this morning. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=53.6s)]
*  But quite notable that some of those allies are already saying that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  But we wouldn't expect Charlie Kirk to say anything that wouldn't be favorable [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  to one of Trump's picks, right? I mean, this isn't necessarily something that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=67.16s)]
*  would come as a surprise. The president-elect just said that senators who [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=69.88s)]
*  oppose his cabinet picks could get primaried if they're unreasonable. How is [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=72.92s)]
*  that playing out behind the scenes? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=76.44s)]
*  Well, you just heard my colleague, Tori, and talk about Joni Ernst as someone who [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=77.92s)]
*  has been noncommittal in supporting Hegseth, someone who herself was even [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=84.08s)]
*  considered perhaps for the role of Secretary of Defense and has been serving [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=88.84s)]
*  on the Armed Services Committee for a long time. You heard her questioning him [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=92.08s)]
*  there on issues related to sexual assault in the military, something we [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  have covered very closely and something that she raised concerns about as far as [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=99.88s)]
*  his handling if he were to lead the Pentagon. He also mentioned Susan Collins [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=104.44s)]
*  and Lisa Murkowski, both Republicans that would need to be locked up with [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=108.0s)]
*  Republicans to make sure that Hegseth were to get through. So it's still [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=111.96s)]
*  uncertain how some of the numbers are going to play out here. A lot of people [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  waiting to see what this hearing brought to see whether or not they'd be [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=121.36s)]
*  supporting Hegseth. So conversations happening there. We know from allies and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=125.0s)]
*  advisers close to Trump that he said he's been making phone calls to people [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=128.72s)]
*  in the Senate where he feels he needs to in order to make sure that his [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=132.88s)]
*  nomination for Hegseth goes through. Obviously, Olivia, this is happening as [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=137.42s)]
*  we are all watching the devastation happening in California and Trump has [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=141.56s)]
*  repeatedly called for California Governor Gavin Newsom to, quote, release [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=144.4s)]
*  the water following the deadly wildfires. How does the president like [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=148.0s)]
*  have any plans to visit the area? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=152.48s)]
*  Well, we've heard from officials in California that they've been in contact [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  with at least L. A. Mayor Karen Bass about potentially visiting. We've heard [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=159.2s)]
*  reports that he could go as soon as next week, and Trump himself said he'd be [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=163.32s)]
*  interested in going. He had visited previously when he was president back in [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=167.39999999999998s)]
*  2018 and towards some of the fire devastation with Governor Gavin Newsom. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=170.64s)]
*  So something that could potentially happen again as Trump continues to pound [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  on L. A officials, California officials about their handling of the wildfires [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=180.28s)]
*  out there. Olivia Rinaly, thank you so much. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YQHkNiixk&t=184.57999999999998s)]
