*  It's going to create inflation in the U.S., create inflation in Canada. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTmGgzhXhEo&t=189.84s)]
*  That said, you have backed strong and forceful counter tariffs. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTmGgzhXhEo&t=193.76s)]
*  What are they? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTmGgzhXhEo&t=197.6s)]
*  Let's see what President Trump comes out with. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTmGgzhXhEo&t=198.8s)]
*  But I can tell you one thing, we're going to lie down and roll over. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTmGgzhXhEo&t=201.2s)]
*  We will use every single tool we have in our toolbox to retaliate. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTmGgzhXhEo&t=205.52s)]
*  60% of our energy gets flowed down to the U.S. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTmGgzhXhEo&t=210.48s)]
*  The electricity that Ontario provides to keep 1.5 million homes lit up in Michigan, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTmGgzhXhEo&t=215.12s)]
*  in New York, in Minnesota. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTmGgzhXhEo&t=221.04s)]
*  The list goes on, our high-grade nickel that we shipped out to the U.S. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTmGgzhXhEo&t=223.28s)]
*  Would those potentially be sectors that you could and would target, then? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTmGgzhXhEo&t=226.88s)]
*  Everything's on the table. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTmGgzhXhEo&t=231.84s)]
*  Absolutely everything. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTmGgzhXhEo&t=233.28s)]
