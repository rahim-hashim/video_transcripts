*  CBS News political reporter Erin Navarro joins us now from West Palm Beach, Florida. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=51.32s)]
*  Erin, what have we heard from Trump about the decision to move the inauguration indoors, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=56.2s)]
*  and what does this mean for other traditions like the parade down Pennsylvania Avenue? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=60.2s)]
*  Lindsay, good evening. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=64.4s)]
*  As you mentioned, President-elect Trump announced that he will now be doing the inauguration [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=67.36s)]
*  ceremonies inside the rotunda in the U.S. Capitol. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=71.7s)]
*  There will also be a viewing, a livestream of the ceremonies in the Capitol One arena. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=75.72s)]
*  That is where he said that the parade that traditionally happens on Pennsylvania Avenue [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=80.38s)]
*  will happen. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=85.92s)]
*  We're waiting to see exactly what that looks like. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=86.92s)]
*  And Trump will also make an appearance there after the swearing-in ceremonies. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=88.12s)]
*  We're also learning a bit more about who will actually be in the rotunda. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  About 350 to 400 people max can get in there. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=95.68s)]
*  And it'll include people who already had those exclusive tickets to be on his presidential [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=99.36000000000001s)]
*  platform outside, as well as members of Congress who were planning to attend. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  What can you tell us about Trump's pre-inauguration weekend, including this victory rally on Sunday? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=108.36000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we know that he will leave from here in Florida to Virginia to his golf course [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=115.08s)]
*  there where he will hold a reception and fireworks on Saturday evening, as well as a cabinet [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  meeting and vice presidential dinner. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=127.24s)]
*  On Sunday, he will begin the day at the Arlington National Cemetery before holding that pre-inauguration [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=129.76s)]
*  rally in the Capitol One arena on Sunday afternoon. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=135.28s)]
*  And today, as he announced the move indoors for his inauguration ceremonies, Trump noted [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=139.57999999999998s)]
*  that his events on Saturday and Sunday remain on schedule. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  Trump also said Friday that he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  What do we know about that conversation? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Trump announced that he had that call this morning, said that he talked to Xi Jinping [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=154.64s)]
*  about balancing trade between the two countries, talked about fentanyl, as well as TikTok. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=161.2s)]
*  We saw that big Supreme Court ruling happening just today. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=166.17999999999998s)]
*  He also had a bit of a optimistic line at the end of his post as well, saying that he [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=169.6s)]
*  and Xi will, quote, do everything possible to make the world more peaceful and safe. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=173.98000000000002s)]
*  Interesting, just given the rhetoric we saw from Trump as a candidate in 2024, where he [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=178.38s)]
*  said that he would impose a 60 percent tax on goods from China. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=183.54000000000002s)]
*  And interesting as well, given that his secretary of state nominee Marco Rubio at a congressional [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=188.06s)]
*  hearing just this week said that America has an unbalanced relationship with China and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=192.3s)]
*  said that they are the, quote, biggest threat to American prosperity. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=197.08s)]
*  We've also learned that China's vice president will be in attendance at Trump's inauguration [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=200.74s)]
*  this upcoming Monday. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=204.86s)]
*  Erin Navarro, thank you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=205.86s)]
*  CBS News will, of course, have extensive all-day coverage of president-elect Donald Trump's [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=208.22s)]
*  inauguration starting Monday at 6 a.m. Eastern Time. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=211.94s)]
*  You can watch right here on CBS News 24-7. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jlQP1bAbug&t=215.3s)]
