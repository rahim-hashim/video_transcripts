**CBS News:** [March 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI)
*  As Hollywood gets ready to honor its best at the Academy Awards this weekend, there are still [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI&t=0.0s)]
*  unanswered questions about the death of two-time Oscar winner Gene Hackman and his wife. The couple [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  was found dead this week in their New Mexico home. On Friday, investigators ruled out carbon [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI&t=9.6s)]
*  monoxide poisoning and revealed other clues that may lead them to determine what did happen. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Tom Hanson is following the case in Santa Fe. Law enforcement in Santa Fe provided few new details [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI&t=20.56s)]
*  Friday on what caused the death of Gene Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa. The manner and cause [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI&t=27.68s)]
*  of death has not been determined. The official results of the autopsy and toxicology reports [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI&t=33.52s)]
*  are pending. Both individuals tested negative for carbon monoxide. Sheriff Adan Mendoza said [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI&t=39.52s)]
*  final results could be weeks away. I think we just found two, one deceased person inside a house. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI&t=46.32s)]
*  The couple's bodies were found Wednesday by maintenance workers and after a frantic call to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI&t=54.72s)]
*  911, county fire and sheriff's deputies descended on this Santa Fe residence. Are they moving at all? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI&t=59.36s)]
*  No, they're not moving. Just sent somebody up here really quick. Much of the investigation [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI&t=66.88s)]
*  is happening just up this road behind gates and a guard in an affluent neighborhood where homes [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI&t=71.76s)]
*  are separated by acres of land. That's where Hackman and his wife chose to live, decidedly secluded. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI&t=77.36s)]
*  A search warrant released Friday showed investigators removed thyroid and heart [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI&t=84.64s)]
*  medications as well as medical records, a 2025 monthly planner and two green cell phones. Have [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI&t=88.64s)]
*  investigators been able to get into the obtained cell phones? Not at this time. We have them in our [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI&t=95.28s)]
*  possession. Those were collected yesterday. It's going to take a process. The process also includes [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI&t=99.84s)]
*  figuring out a timeline. Though Hackman's pacemaker stopped working on February 17th, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI&t=105.84s)]
*  it's only a clue and doesn't mean he died then. I think the event of the pacemaker gives us an idea. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  Also unanswered, the contents of the pills found scattered near Arakawa's body, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI&t=118.24s)]
*  why only one of the couple's three dogs was caged and also found dead, and why this happened in the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI&t=122.55999999999999s)]
*  first place. For CBS Saturday Morning, Tom Hanson, Santa Fe, New Mexico. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emAmMTKBxKI&t=129.44s)]
