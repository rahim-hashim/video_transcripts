# Georgia pastor calls for Target boycott over DEI policies
**CBS News:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY)
*  As Christians across the country and around the world mark the start of Len, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=0.0s)]
*  many observers give up things like sweets or vices or bad habits. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=2.92s)]
*  But one prominent Georgia pastor is calling for a different type of fast and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=7.36s)]
*  that is to not shop at Target for the next 40 days. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=11.16s)]
*  The move is in response to the retail giants decision to revoke its diversity, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=15.4s)]
*  equity and inclusion initiatives. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=19.14s)]
*  After president Trump ordered DEI to be removed from federal agencies and after [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=20.96s)]
*  a Supreme court ruling related to the topic. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=25.78s)]
*  Other fortune 500 companies, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=28.279999999999998s)]
*  including Amazon and Walmart and CBS news as parent company Paramount have made [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=29.779999999999998s)]
*  similar moves. Target sales and profits slid in the fourth quarter of last year. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=33.56s)]
*  Pastor Jamal Bryant, who is leading the charge, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=38.54s)]
*  told our Elise Preston that these 40 days are just to start. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=40.76s)]
*  40 is the benchmark. It is not the finish line. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=45.16s)]
*  And so at the end of the 40 days we will recalibrate, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=48.92s)]
*  see where it is that we are, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=51.92s)]
*  send our data to the board at Target and if they don't respond, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=53.68s)]
*  we'll go another 40. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  The pastor's calls are being received by members of his church going community. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=60.36s)]
*  Absolutely right. Because Target doesn't appreciate us. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=65.4s)]
*  Why should we give them our finances? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=69.12s)]
*  I totally support his fast. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=72.2s)]
*  I am not with companies who are not inclusive of everyone. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=74.8s)]
*  And like I said before, I totally supported. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=79.44s)]
*  I am going to participate in it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=82.52s)]
*  And I was going to do it anyway before he even called for that fast. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  CBS news correspondent Elise Preston joins us now from Los Angeles. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=88.36s)]
*  So Elise, a 24 hour economic blackout was called for last Friday. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  What happened there and what does this pastor hope comes of this 40 day fast of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=94.91999999999999s)]
*  Target? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  Hey Lindsey. So with this fast, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=100.28s)]
*  they are really hoping that there is a message sent to the company. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=102.6s)]
*  You have to know or you have to think that, or excuse me, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  you have to remember that black Americans have a spending power of [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=109.88000000000001s)]
*  $2 trillion in this country. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  So they are believing that they'll be able to make a big economic imprint [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=116.4s)]
*  on the company. If people are not spending money, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=121.36000000000001s)]
*  if people are not shopping there and they're looking at history, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=124.92s)]
*  when they're looking at, you know, how successful this could be. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=129.4s)]
*  This is just one of many boycotts that we have seen in the American [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=134.0s)]
*  history timeline, as far as black Americans fighting for certain things. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=138.96s)]
*  So they're hoping that this really sends a message to Target. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=143.56s)]
*  And they're saying that what makes America great is the diversity here. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=147.4s)]
*  Just take a listen to what else he had to say. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=151.8s)]
*  This is a direct assault on the strides that were made in the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=154.8s)]
*  civil rights movement. Let's not forget Atlanta, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=159.72s)]
*  where I pastor is the heartbeat of the movement, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  the home of Dr. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=165.32000000000002s)]
*  Martin Luther King that we're holding it with the constitution says that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=167.04000000000002s)]
*  all men are created equal. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=172.08s)]
*  And so for America to operate with a blindfold as if [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  we are in a post-racial society is absolutely delusional. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=179.4s)]
*  Now, Lindsay, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=185.36s)]
*  the pastor went on to say that when he found out that Target made a reversal on [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  some of these policies, he was absolutely flabbergasted. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  And for him, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=193.64s)]
*  it was a little painful because a lot of these policies were rolled out right [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=194.64s)]
*  after George Floyd's death. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=199.27999999999997s)]
*  At least what did he tell you a successful movement would look like and how does [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=201.64s)]
*  he gauge success? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=205.16s)]
*  So he's hoping that people take part. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=207.0s)]
*  They pointed to a petition where about 110,000 people have [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  signed on saying that they would participate in this Target fast, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=214.16s)]
*  not shopping at 40 days. But again, this could be just the beginning. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=218.04s)]
*  They could go in other 40 days. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  We don't know. But he also brought up that Montgomery bus boycott that took [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=223.24s)]
*  place in 1955 and it lasted more than a year, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=228.12s)]
*  about 381 days to be exact. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=232.24s)]
*  And so black people did not, they did not take the bus. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=235.16s)]
*  They boycotted the system. And at the end, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  there was integration of the bus boycott. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=242.0s)]
*  So that is what they're kind of looking at in taking their cues. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=244.56s)]
*  They've asked Target to not only go back and reinstate these [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=248.72s)]
*  policies, but they're also hoping more things come out of it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=253.39999999999998s)]
*  The pastor pointed to having possible stands or kiosks of [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=256.28s)]
*  Target at HBCUs. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  They're asking for investments into black communities across the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=262.8s)]
*  country. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=267.48s)]
*  What is Target saying about all this? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=268.32s)]
*  About the boycott, Target has not said anything, but they, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=270.68s)]
*  we've reached out to them and they have not responded, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=274.2s)]
*  but we have reached out to them over the last couple of weeks, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=276.72s)]
*  just in regards to the policy. Now, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=280.04s)]
*  Target gave us a link to what their policy is, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=282.36s)]
*  which does state that they are ending certain programs that are [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=286.36s)]
*  related to DEI, but they said that they are excited to have a [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=291.36s)]
*  joyous shopping experience for all that they would be having products [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=296.16s)]
*  in their stores from all communities, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=301.0s)]
*  from owners and sellers of all communities and that their employee resource [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=303.2s)]
*  groups that the company has would be for everyone. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=307.44s)]
*  Okay. Elise Preston, thank you. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PN3Crl66EY&t=311.52s)]
