# U.S. envoy says talks with Ukraine are positive amid Trump criticism of Zelenskyy
**CBS News:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU)
*  All right, now we move to this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=0.0s)]
*  Ukraine and European allies are being vigilant after a meeting between the U.S. Envoy to Ukraine and President Zelensky. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=1.12s)]
*  General Keith Kellogg praised the, quote, positive meeting after a war of words between President Trump and Zelensky. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS correspondent, or excuse me, BBC correspondent, Abduljulil Abdur-Russelov. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=15.52s)]
*  President Zelensky says he met with the U.S. envoy yesterday in Kiev despite these boiling tensions [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=21.92s)]
*  stemming from President Trump's remarks. What came out of this meeting? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=29.04s)]
*  Well, to be honest, we don't have a lot of details because the press conference following that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  meeting between President Zelensky and General Kellogg was cancelled. And for some people that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=42.48s)]
*  was a sign that General Kellogg is being increasingly sidelined from the process. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=47.84s)]
*  Well, following that event, President Zelensky posted on his social media saying that the meeting [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=54.0s)]
*  gave hope. And General Kellogg also tweeted or sent a post on ex-formerly known as Twitter saying that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=61.04s)]
*  the meeting was extensive and positive. When he came here, he said that his mission was to listen [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=68.64s)]
*  and the Ukrainian officials were very hopeful that he could deliver their message to Donald Trump, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=76.4s)]
*  that they cannot trust Vladimir Putin and that they have to have a joint plan. They need to discuss [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=82.16s)]
*  between the U.S., Europe and Ukraine, discuss their positions and only then approach Moscow [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  and start negotiations with them. However, there are questions whether General Kellogg has ear of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=95.84s)]
*  Donald Trump because, as I said, yesterday the press conference was cancelled and also earlier [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=101.92s)]
*  during the visit to Saudi Arabia, he wasn't there. So there are questions here whether he can [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=107.44s)]
*  convince Donald Trump to persuade him and pass on the messages that Ukrainian officials want here. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=114.96s)]
*  And Abdul Jalil, you wonder what other options President Zelensky even has despite his frustration [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  at President Trump's comments in regards to Russia. Europe is even divided on how it could [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=129.36s)]
*  back up Ukraine. So talk to us about the unique position Zelensky is in and how in many ways [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=134.8s)]
*  he's running out of choices. He is in a very delicate and difficult position and in fact when [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  he was responding to the initial claims made by Donald Trump, he was actually carefully [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  choosing his words exactly for the same reason in order not to antagonize Donald Trump and because [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=156.56s)]
*  he cannot afford losing an ally like the United States. This is the main ally of Ukraine and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=162.96s)]
*  Keith admits that without American military support it will be extremely hard for them [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=170.0s)]
*  to continue their resistance to Russian aggression. Just a few examples, for the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=174.4s)]
*  Patriot systems, air defense systems, the American air defense systems, they are already running out [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=180.56s)]
*  of ammunition and missiles for that and they need more launchers and units in order to expand and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=185.84s)]
*  improve their air defense capacity. But they're already facing these difficulties and this weapon [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=192.8s)]
*  is the only weapon that can intercept hypersonic missiles like Russian Kinzhal. So without American [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  military support certainly the airstrikes that Russia launches almost every day will be even [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  more lethal than they are already. And there are also questions about ammunition, there are questions [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=213.52s)]
*  about the F-16 fighter jets and if the United States withdraws its support for Ukraine then [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=217.84s)]
*  all this may stop. Such an important point Abdul Jilayel, Abdul Roselab joining us out of Kyiv. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=223.2s)]
*  Thank you so much for those updates from Ukraine. We want to cross now to CBS News White House [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=230.0s)]
*  reporter Olivia Rinaldi. Olivia there's such an interesting point made there about the air defense [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  systems from Ukraine. What's the latest you're hearing from the White House on why they chose [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=239.92s)]
*  to cancel the press conference between Zelensky and Keith Kellogg? That's not an encouraging sign [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=244.24s)]
*  or at least it seems like it's not. Well it's interesting as this is all coming as these meetings [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=249.60000000000002s)]
*  are happening in a flurry. We're learning that that press conference between the two was scrapped. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  We're hearing from the Ukrainians though that it was at the request of the U.S. side to not do a [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=260.16s)]
*  press conference at the end of this and rather have just a quick photo op spray. There was a question [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=265.44s)]
*  asked to Zelensky at the end of that photo op spray about how he's feeling and he said he's in a [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=270.32s)]
*  fighting spirit. Interesting to note there but this all comes as of course tensions are really [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=275.92s)]
*  deepening between the U.S. and Ukraine, between the leadership as Donald Trump has said that he's [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=281.04s)]
*  blaming the start of the war in Ukraine on Zelensky and Zelensky saying that Trump was [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  parroting misinformation from both sides and this is as they're trying to find an end to this war. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=292.0s)]
*  Take a listen to what national security advisor Mike Walz had to say just a short while ago at [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=299.2s)]
*  CPAC where he was talking about this exact issue. I are in Gaza post October 7th then what oppose [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=304.4s)]
*  peace in Europe? It makes no sense but under with his leadership we've now opened negotiations. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=312.96s)]
*  We're sitting down with our host the Saudis and talking to the Russians understanding what [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=320.56s)]
*  they are going to need and then understanding what the Ukrainians are going to need talking to [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=328.88s)]
*  all of the Europeans. You can't end a war if you don't talk to both sides and that's what we're [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  doing. Thank you. I think some Americans they're talking about the reason why it's important that [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=339.28s)]
*  they're all talking to each other of course the Europeans at the table, Ukrainians and the Russians [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=344.4s)]
*  as well very important to have them in on the conversation. Keith Kellogg being there today he's [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=349.68s)]
*  still there in Ukraine having some meetings this is the last day of those meetings but we will be [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=355.92s)]
*  looking forward to see what else is on the calendar what else is on the table as the White House seeks [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=361.36s)]
*  an end to this nearly three-year-long war. Yeah Olivia and observers are noting the order of the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  conversations which is noteworthy that President Trump has said he's open to meeting with Russian [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=372.72s)]
*  President Vladimir Putin maybe even in person to discuss what comes next. While Zelensky [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=378.08000000000004s)]
*  hasn't had that specific offer yet have we heard anything new on a potential one-on-one between [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=384.0s)]
*  Trump and Putin? Nothing quite new yet we heard from President Trump this week where he said he [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=388.72s)]
*  wants to meet with Putin perhaps this month Putin's the Kremlin saying that a meeting could come this [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=393.92s)]
*  month as well but of course there's only one week left of this month and we know next week [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  President Trump will be meeting with Emmanuel Macron the French president as well as Keir [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=405.92s)]
*  Stammer the British prime minister here in Washington next week so meetings happening with [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=411.12s)]
*  European allies not quite yet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Secretary of State [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=415.6s)]
*  Marco Rubio just came back from Saudi Arabia where he said that a meeting with Putin will largely [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=421.04s)]
*  depend on progress on ending the war essentially what they can all offer and what they could get [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=426.16s)]
*  on the table from all sides so when you're hearing about these meetings with Keith Kellogg [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=432.72s)]
*  the special envoy to Ukraine in Ukraine what we're hearing about the critical minerals deal [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=436.88s)]
*  all these sorts of drips and drabs of information we're getting out of the Ukrainian side [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=443.12s)]
*  is ultimately so that they can come to the table the U.S. can come to the table with the Russians [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=446.88s)]
*  and say here's where our vested interest lies here's where we want to see the end of this war [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=451.2s)]
*  and really having those conversations with them so I suspect that they're waiting for [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=456.72s)]
*  all the stars to align in this very very intricate web of information about ending this war. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=460.96s)]
*  That's right there are many moving pieces. Olivia Rinaldi joining us from our DC bureau. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=467.44s)]
*  Olivia thank you for your reporting. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_JM8aW3VU&t=472.48s)]
