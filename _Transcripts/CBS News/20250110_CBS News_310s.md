# What to know about Trump's criminal sentence
**CBS News:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE)
*  President-elect Donald Trump has been sentenced now in his New York criminal case. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump appeared in court virtually from Mar-a-Lago. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=5.34s)]
*  Justice Juan Marchand gave the president-elect a sentence of, quote, unconditional discharge. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=8.36s)]
*  Now, that means that Trump will not serve jail time or have any other restrictions ahead [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=13.36s)]
*  of his inauguration in just 10 days. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=17.56s)]
*  You'll recall a jury found him guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=20.72s)]
*  back in May. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=25.78s)]
*  The president-elect spoke at his sentencing today. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=26.78s)]
*  It's been a political witch hunt. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  It was done to damage my reputation so that I'd lose the election. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  And obviously, that didn't work. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=36.88s)]
*  CBS News political reporters Katrina Kaufman and Erin Navarro join us now. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=39.2s)]
*  So, Katrina, I'm going to start with you here with me in the studio. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=43.68s)]
*  You were in the room when Trump was sentenced. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=47.160000000000004s)]
*  What was something, what was the mood like? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=49.94s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=52.28s)]
*  I mean, it was just so unusual to have Trump be up there on the screen with his lawyer, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=53.28s)]
*  Todd Blanch. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  The judge was watching him on the monitor. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=60.4s)]
*  And really, there wasn't a lot of emotion shown in that courtroom. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  It was full of reporters, a few members of the public, the sketch artists. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=65.52s)]
*  But what was really remarkable were Trump's words. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=70.2s)]
*  And it was just so unusual for a criminal defendant to speak that way before a judge [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=73.82s)]
*  at his own sentencing, to show no remorse, no contrition. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=79.28s)]
*  It really shows the power that Trump feels he has now that he has been reelected into [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=84.54s)]
*  office and also with the knowledge that the judge was going to give him this unconditional [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=90.14s)]
*  discharge. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=94.98s)]
*  And he intends to appeal additionally. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=96.46000000000001s)]
*  So Erin, what do you make of the way that Trump talked about this case? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=99.46000000000001s)]
*  Lana, good to be with you. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=104.26s)]
*  He's shown that he's been consistently aggrieved by this case. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=107.78s)]
*  Even last night when he was speaking to Republican governors in Mar-a-Lago, and he referenced [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=111.48s)]
*  to today's sentencing as prosecutors, quote, having fun with their political opponent, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=116.92s)]
*  he also called the case and the judge, quote, a disgrace. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  And he continued to maintain that he did nothing wrong in what he said in court. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  And as Katrina mentioned, you can sense that he feels vindicated by the 2024 election and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=129.4s)]
*  wrote in a True Social Post after the sentencing, quote, the real jury, the American people, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=135.32s)]
*  have spoken by reelecting me. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=140.28s)]
*  I do think it's notable that while he has bemoaned this case, said it is a, quote, terrible [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=142.2s)]
*  experience, he is looking to appeal, potentially overturn that conviction. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=148.16s)]
*  So this may not be the last development we have in this case. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=152.48s)]
*  And Katrina, talk to us about why the judge decided on this sentence in particular. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=156.06s)]
*  And other people have described it as a slap on the wrist, but it's still a felony. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=161.88s)]
*  And that carries lifelong repercussions for people. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=166.6s)]
*  I do think that there is significant weight to this. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=170.2s)]
*  It's why Trump tried so hard to prevent this day from happening. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=173.12s)]
*  He is now finally a full convicted felon now that the sentence has been proclaimed, even [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=176.92s)]
*  if there are no terms to his release or to this judgment. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=182.84s)]
*  But the judge really talked about the extraordinary circumstances here. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=186.92s)]
*  The fact that Trump has now been reelected into office just allows him what the judge [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=191.26s)]
*  called extraordinary protections. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=196.04s)]
*  He also was very careful to say that those are protections allowed for the office, not [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  the occupant, which felt like a little bit of a statement at Trump. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  But he said, given that, he really just felt that there was no choice but for the conviction [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=207.72s)]
*  to be that he is sentenced with an unconditional discharge. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=212.76s)]
*  Because once Trump is in office, he just couldn't put any parameters on him to give him imprisonment, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=216.64s)]
*  probation. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=221.92s)]
*  Perhaps back in July, we might have seen something like community service. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=222.92s)]
*  But when Trump is leading the United States, a judge just can't put that sentence on him. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=226.94000000000003s)]
*  And I think it also made it so the Supreme Court allowed this to move forward too, because [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=232.66000000000003s)]
*  they pointed out that the judge was giving him these really lenient terms. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=237.54000000000002s)]
*  And Aaron, how much overlap is there between Trump's legal team in this case and who he's [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=243.5s)]
*  been picking for the administration? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=249.62s)]
*  Yeah, it's a significant amount of his personal lawyers who will be involved in the upcoming [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=252.58s)]
*  administration. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=257.62s)]
*  One big one, Pam Bondi, who was part of the legal counsel in Trump's first impeachment [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=258.94s)]
*  trial, is Trump's pick for attorney general. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=264.26s)]
*  Todd Blanch, who represented Trump in this case in Manhattan, was his pick for deputy [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=267.34000000000003s)]
*  attorney general. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=272.54s)]
*  And Lena Haber, who represented Trump in this case against E. Jean Carroll, will be White [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=273.78000000000003s)]
*  House counselor. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=278.18s)]
*  That's the role that Kellyanne Conway held during his first term. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=279.9s)]
*  So a good amount of his personal counsel will be involved in the upcoming White House. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=283.29999999999995s)]
*  All right, Katrina Kaufman, Aaron Navarro, thank you both. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=288.02s)]
*  Well, we are going to continue to follow this story for you throughout the day, and that [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCpyEBGiYZE&t=295.9s)]
