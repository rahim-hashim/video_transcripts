# Zelenskyy says Trump living in "disinformation space" after Trump seemingly blames Ukraine for war
**CBS News:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA)
*  All right, let's talk about what we were just speaking with Nancy Kordes about. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=0.0s)]
*  Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky says President Trump is living in a Russian disinformation [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=4.16s)]
*  space. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=8.96s)]
*  Those are his words. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=9.96s)]
*  It comes on the heels of yesterday's meeting between the United States and Russian officials, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=10.96s)]
*  which Ukraine was not invited to. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  And it follows the commander-in-chief seemingly blaming Ukraine for starting the war. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  I want to play that sound bite. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=20.84s)]
*  But today I heard, oh, well, we weren't invited. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=22.96s)]
*  Well, you've been there for three years. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=24.64s)]
*  You should have ended it three years. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=26.12s)]
*  You should have never started it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=27.88s)]
*  You could have made a deal. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  I've been there for three years. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  It's their country. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=32.56s)]
*  Their country was—President Zelensky's remarks came shortly before he was set to meet with [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=33.56s)]
*  the U.S. special envoy this morning in Kiev. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  He claims Ukraine has evidence Russia is feeding the White House misinformation. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=39.6s)]
*  So I want to bring in Nina Khrushcheva. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  She's a professor in the Julian J. Studley Graduate Program of International Affairs [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  at the new school. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=51.84s)]
*  And if her name sounds familiar, she is, in fact, the great-granddaughter of former Soviet [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=52.84s)]
*  leader Nikita Khrushchev. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=57.64s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us, Professor. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=59.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=61.24s)]
*  So what was your initial reaction to the comments from President Trump that it's Ukraine's [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=63.56s)]
*  fault for the war in Ukraine, that they've been there for three years? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  It is—of course, they've been there. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=72.48s)]
*  It's their country. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  What did you think when you heard those comments? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, Trump is throwing words out and kind of looks at where they land somehow. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=77.8s)]
*  He's not a particular craftsman in narratives. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=85.76s)]
*  I mean, he has grand narratives, but they're not refined because quickly after that, he [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=88.56s)]
*  said, well, they should have made a deal. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=94.32s)]
*  And I think that's what he was referring to, that in the three years of war, Ukraine had [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=96.32s)]
*  opportunities to make a deal and now would have to make a deal because there is no way [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=102.28s)]
*  out for Ukraine. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=106.72s)]
*  I think that's what he meant, but it certainly sounded very Trumpian. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=107.72s)]
*  It sounded very dramatic. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  We also know Zelensky is not his favorite person, and he's much rather talking to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  Putin. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  And so I guess that came through. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  Not I guess. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=122.56s)]
*  It did come through in that interview. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=123.56s)]
*  What is your reaction or what is your thinking on how they are feeling at the Kremlin? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=127.88s)]
*  In other words, this invasion happened. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=133.4s)]
*  It was condemned by our European allies. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=136.44s)]
*  It was condemned by the United States. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=139.08s)]
*  The sanctions were put into place against Russia, and now we are—the United States [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=142.44000000000003s)]
*  is considering removing those sanctions. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  And in fact, as you've heard from the secretary of defense and the secretary of state and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  the president of the United States, suggesting that Ukraine's—the gains that the Russians [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=154.28s)]
*  have made in Ukraine may ultimately not go back—in other words, they may keep those [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  gains. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=166.24s)]
*  Ukraine's borders may look very different after whatever is agreed upon is implemented. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=167.32000000000002s)]
*  How do you think that they're feeling in Russia about the fact that they were able [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=173.52s)]
*  to do this and not suffer any consequences, at least going forward with this new president? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=177.52s)]
*  Well, I mean, the Kremlin feels like it's—you know, it waited enough. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  It withstood all the sanctions and everything that is being thrown at Russia, Putin feels. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=187.88s)]
*  And now he finally waited out. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=195.0s)]
*  I mean, let's remember this man is a—used to be KGB operative. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  He knows how to kind of wait out all other storms in the universe. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  And he feels totally vindicated in this, that his expectations finally came through, that [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  the West is not unified, that the West is getting—going to get tired of all these [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=215.44s)]
*  things that are through at Russia. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=222.98000000000002s)]
*  And it's happening. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=224.78s)]
*  So it does seem that this, at least for now, Putin feels that he's very close to his goal [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=225.78s)]
*  of—as the war began in 2024, now coming on the three-year anniversary very soon, February [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=233.10000000000002s)]
*  22, that Ukraine is going to be denazified, Ukraine is going to be demilitarized, Ukraine [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=243.78s)]
*  is going to be defeated, even if it's not defeated as a nation, as a country, it's going [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=252.3s)]
*  to certainly lose territories. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=257.62s)]
*  And that's what Putin felt he got. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=260.06s)]
*  In fact, we just witnessed a meeting between the Russians and the Americans in Riyadh, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=262.58s)]
*  which both sides say went incredibly well. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=270.18s)]
*  The diplomatic relationship is going to be restored. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=273.06s)]
*  So for now, Putin seems like he is a winner. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=276.42s)]
*  We'll see what happens because Trump is quite an unpredictable man. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=279.7s)]
*  He can change his mind. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=283.5s)]
*  But for now, it does seem that Trump is repeating Putin's wildest dreams. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=284.62s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=291.9s)]
*  The president can be unpredictable. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=293.78000000000003s)]
*  But as you suggested, the fact that a former KGB officer is the president of Russia right [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=295.24s)]
*  now gives me a sense that part of being a covert KGB operative is that you anticipate [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=300.62s)]
*  the unpredictability of your opponent. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=308.1s)]
*  So the question then becomes, what does the New World Order look like if this rapprochement [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=311.02000000000004s)]
*  between Russia and the United States continues as it is continuing? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=316.90000000000003s)]
*  As you know, obviously, going back to the end of World War II, up until that brief period [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=321.70000000000005s)]
*  of glasnost, and continuing with Vladimir Putin, the United States and Russia have been [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=326.62s)]
*  at odd ends, first with the Cold War and now with the rise of Putin. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=330.82s)]
*  But I wonder if we are seeing the breakdown of the old social world order, and you now [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=335.68s)]
*  have potentially the United States and Russia and other former Soviet countries like Hungary [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=341.56s)]
*  or Belarus who are aligned together, and the rest of Europe aligned against the U.S. and [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=347.0s)]
*  the Russians, even if they don't have the economic or military might to actually withstand [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=352.8s)]
*  anything that might be decided by these two superpowers. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=357.64s)]
*  Could we potentially see that down the line? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=361.12s)]
*  Well, it's amazing because you mentioned glasnost and Mikhail Gorbachev, the one who instigated [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=363.92s)]
*  glasnost in the late 1980s. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=368.16s)]
*  He used to say that in your question, there is an answer. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=371.8s)]
*  You actually answered the question. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, yes, we've never seen anything like that. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=376.92s)]
*  Basically, what we're seeing today is that Putin and Trump and CCP and Recep Erdogan [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=379.92s)]
*  of Turkey and others in Orban of Hungary, they're sort of in one camp, and Europe and [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=386.12s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky and Japan and South Korea are in another camp. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=391.32s)]
*  I mean, we don't know exactly where Japan and South Korea stand at this moment, but I [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=397.0s)]
*  would assume that they are those Western allies that now seem to be left by Trump behind. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=400.84s)]
*  I don't think we've ever seen that kind of configuration. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=408.4s)]
*  Only in the 19th century during the times of great wars when, you know, France would [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=411.08s)]
*  be against Germany and Russia would be on one side or another. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=415.68s)]
*  But in the 21st century in modern world, we don't know what the new world order will [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=419.36s)]
*  be like unless Trump is convinced that the West should be the West and the rest actually [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=425.15999999999997s)]
*  should be should be somehow democratically instructed. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=429.92s)]
*  But what is democracy? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=436.92s)]
*  You had a piece on Elon Musk who talks about all this all this bureaucracy that nobody [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=438.2s)]
*  that nobody ever elected. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=445.08s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=446.84s)]
*  And Elon Musk was greatly elected as a as a bureaucrat or breaking bureaucracy. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=447.36s)]
*  So I don't think we can predict that that that world order that is going to come. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=452.08s)]
*  But we certainly see that the World War Two architecture that even not even Trump, but [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=456.68s)]
*  actually Putin, with the first one to start destroying in 2008 when the Russian troops [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=461.76s)]
*  went into Georgia, the former Soviet Republic, that it does seem to be another cycle of [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=467.2s)]
*  that destruction. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=474.04s)]
*  And the third and the fourth and the fifth is is yet to come. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=475.16s)]
*  We have four years of Trump. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=478.92s)]
*  So we'll see what happens next. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=480.24s)]
*  Yeah, Professor, this has been a fascinating discussion. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=482.32s)]
*  We didn't even get into how China figures into all of this. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=484.76000000000005s)]
*  Somebody I saw somebody posit that perhaps this is Trump's early attempt at sort of [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajPzPWZ1CA&t=488.32000000000005s)]
