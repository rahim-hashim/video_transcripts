# Lawmakers react to Trump's executive orders
**CBS News:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8)
*  Day two of the new Trump administration happening right now. The president is attending the National Prayer Service at the Washington National Cathedral. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=0.0s)]
*  Now this all comes just hours after Trump launched his aggressive presidential agenda by citing 26, 26 executive orders on day one of his administration. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=8.0s)]
*  Those orders included a crackdown of immigration at the border, bringing down inflation, an extension to keep TikTok here in the U.S. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=19.0s)]
*  And a major shift in energy and climate policies. President Trump also granted pardons to roughly 1500 people involved in the insurrection of the Capitol building on January 6th, 2021. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=27.0s)]
*  Now, those pardons include clemency for people convicted of assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy. It also includes six commutations. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=40.0s)]
*  Trump has repeatedly downplayed the events that unfolded during that transition of power process, where then President Joe Biden was elected to office. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=50.0s)]
*  Lawmakers already responding to that move this morning. Senator Mark Warner had this to say earlier today. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=58.0s)]
*  I was here on January 6th. I saw the horror and the terror of these insurrectionists. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=65.0s)]
*  What message does this send to law enforcement when some of these rioters brutally attacked policemen and now they're getting a full commutation? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=74.0s)]
*  I don't know what this says about rule of law. It's like the president's executive order around part of the Constitution, birthright citizenship. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=89.0s)]
*  I think the question is, are the laws of our nation going to mean anything or can they be taken away by the stroke of the pen? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=102.0s)]
*  Now, Republicans, meanwhile, are pushing back on the criticism of pardons issued by Trump. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=111.0s)]
*  They argue that former President Biden opened the door when he issued blanket pardons for his entire family. Take a listen to that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=117.0s)]
*  As you should pay attention, this probably won't get reported, but I hope it does. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=124.0s)]
*  And that's the abuse of the abuse of the pardon process by Joe Biden. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=128.0s)]
*  I hope anybody who's going to be critical of what occurred last night is also very critical of a massive overreach by President Biden. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=134.0s)]
*  Perspective pardons, kind of like a get out of jail free card, makes no sense to me either. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=142.0s)]
*  So to answer your question, maybe we need to go back and look at the contours of the authority that future presidents have around pardoning. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=147.0s)]
*  What I said before, Biden was the most massive use of the pardon power that we've seen in history. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=155.0s)]
*  And I think you guys are probably not asking the same questions. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=165.0s)]
*  Let's bring in now CBS News Chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes for more on day two of Trump's administration. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=170.0s)]
*  Now, Nancy, we just heard the arguments for and against pardons playing out among lawmakers today. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=177.0s)]
*  How does this move from Trump undermine some of the legacy that Biden was trying to establish during his administration? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=182.0s)]
*  Yeah, Liz, I think this is a case of you see the pardons you want to see. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=191.0s)]
*  Obviously, Republicans want to try to keep the focus on Biden's surprise pardons yesterday, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=195.0s)]
*  about 20 minutes before he left office, preemptively pardoning his siblings and their spouses. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=202.0s)]
*  Not, he said, because they did anything wrong, but that he was worried that the Biden administration might try to come after them. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=209.0s)]
*  And Democrats are obviously focused on these 1500, 1600 pardons by President Trump, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=217.0s)]
*  who went ahead and pardoned even violent offenders, which some Republicans, even some of the Republicans you played right there, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=225.0s)]
*  had been urging him not to do. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=232.0s)]
*  And so, yes, with a stroke of the pen last night, President Trump undid years of work by the Department of Justice to, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=234.0s)]
*  this was the largest investigation of all time, investigating all of these various defendants, trying to figure out who they were, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=244.0s)]
*  who did what in the chaos of what we saw on January 6th. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=251.0s)]
*  Who was it that wielded that flagpole? Who was it that through that punch, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=256.0s)]
*  they had to do all that painstaking work first, piecing together images, videos, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=260.0s)]
*  simply to come up with the prosecutions before any of these individuals were actually tried and convicted? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=267.0s)]
*  That has now suddenly all gone away. The slate has been wiped clean, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=274.0s)]
*  and the defendants and those who have been convicted who were in jail are now being released. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=278.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I should remind our viewers those convictions were a seditious conspiracy, some of them, and assaulting police officers. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=284.0s)]
*  I want to switch gears, though, Nancy. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=290.0s)]
*  President Trump says he will remove over 1,000 political appointees from the Biden administration. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=292.0s)]
*  How does this affect his staffing in the first 100 days in office? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=298.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good question, because often what happens in these situations, of course, you've got, you know, some overlap. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=304.0s)]
*  You've got cases where the new administration comes in every time. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=312.0s)]
*  They want to put their own people in place, but it takes time to hire thousands and thousands of officials at all these different agencies and get them in place. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=316.0s)]
*  So often what will happen is you'll keep the folks who are there on the job until you can replace them. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=324.0s)]
*  Well, basically what Trump is saying in this case is, I'm not doing that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=332.0s)]
*  I'm getting rid of all of those people now, or in some cases, I'm, you know, removing civil servants and keeping them on the job. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=336.0s)]
*  They will remain employees of these various agencies, but I'm taking them out of their leadership position. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=344.0s)]
*  So it does create a lot of vacancies that may take time to fill, depending on how quickly various cabinet members can get confirmed, get on the job, and make some of those hiring decisions. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=350.0s)]
*  And right now, President Trump, alongside Vice President J.D. Vance and their families, are attending the National Prayer Service. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=365.0s)]
*  But he's got a jam packed schedule following the service today. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=372.0s)]
*  Can you walk us through his movements after the service is done? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=375.0s)]
*  Yeah, no rest for the weary. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=380.0s)]
*  Even President Trump looks looks a little bit exhausted sitting there at the National Cathedral after everything that he did yesterday, late into the night with the inaugural balls, et cetera. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=381.0s)]
*  But today he's got a jam packed day as well. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=393.0s)]
*  He's meeting with Republican leaders from the Hill all afternoon. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=396.0s)]
*  As you can imagine, they've got a lot of lot to discuss. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=400.0s)]
*  They've got some very ambitious legislation that they want to try to push through Congress as quickly as possible. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=402.0s)]
*  So they've got to strategize about that. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=409.0s)]
*  And then in the four o'clock hour Eastern time, the White House says he's got a big announcement to make about infrastructure. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=411.0s)]
*  We don't know more than that, but we'll certainly be watching yesterday when he was in the Oval Office with reporters for the first time signing executive orders. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=419.0s)]
*  It turned into a 45 minute hour long Q&A session, basically an impromptu press conference. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=427.0s)]
*  So we'll see what happens today. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=433.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's always very interesting, Nancy. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=435.0s)]
*  The president is very busy and so are you just tracking his movements. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=437.0s)]
*  Thanks so much for keeping us updated. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24htAjhQdy8&t=440.0s)]
