# Audio from inside Trump's "hush money" sentencing
**CBS News:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s)
*  Getting some audio from inside President-elect Donald Trump's hush money sentencing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=0.0s)]
*  The President-elect has received the sentence of an unconditional discharge in the criminal [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=5.48s)]
*  hush money case out of New York City. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=9.9s)]
*  Let's play a little bit of that. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=12.02s)]
*  By pending court proceedings or ongoing sentence related obligations. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=13.76s)]
*  But imposing this sentence ensures that finality. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=19.88s)]
*  Pending the defendant permits this court to enter judgment to cement the defendant's [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=25.98s)]
*  status as a convicted felon while he pursues whatever appeals he intends to pursue. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=31.78s)]
*  And it gives full effect and respect to the jury's verdicts while preserving the defendant's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=39.28s)]
*  ability to govern. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=47.1s)]
*  People therefore recommend that this court impose a sentence of an unconditional discharge. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=55.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=56.02s)]
*  Counsel. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=57.02s)]
*  Thank you, your honor. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=58.02s)]
*  I very, very much disagree with much of what the government just said about this case. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=65.02000000000001s)]
*  About the legitimacy of what happened in this courtroom during the trial. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=74.42s)]
*  And about President Trump's conduct fighting this case from before it was indicted, to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=79.98s)]
*  while it was indicted, to the jury's verdict, and even to this day. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=86.78s)]
*  What the government just said presupposes something that we disagree with very much. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=93.26s)]
*  Which was that this was an appropriate case to be brought. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=100.58s)]
*  It was not. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=105.26s)]
*  This case, without a doubt, knowing everything we know about the timing of the investigation, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=107.48s)]
*  the fact that multiple prosecutors looked at the fact of this case, including prosecutors [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  within the district attorney's office in New York County, and made a decision not to bring [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=120.88000000000001s)]
*  charges. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  As the court knows, shortly after President Trump announced his intention to run for re-election, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=129.68s)]
*  this case was started for what amounted to a third time, which brings us ultimately to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=138.38s)]
*  where we are today. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=144.98000000000002s)]
*  A lot of what the government just said presupposes that this case is legally appropriate, and [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  that the charges that were brought by the people were consistent with the laws of New [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=157.18s)]
*  York. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=161.78s)]
*  Again, we very much disagree with that, and as everybody has been noted, because it's [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=162.78s)]
*  true, we certainly intend on appealing that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=168.18s)]
*  And it's not, by the way, just counsel and President Trump that feels that way. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=171.58s)]
*  There's many, many, many legal experts that share the same views that I just said, which [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=177.88s)]
*  is that legally this case should not have been brought, both based on the facts that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=184.98s)]
*  were established at trial, and also on the legal basis for which they were brought. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=189.28s)]
*  But it's also not just the legal experts, not just counsel, and not just President Trump, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=194.98s)]
*  but the majority of the American people also agree that this case should not have been [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=200.18s)]
*  brought. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=206.38s)]
*  I mean, the interesting thing about the fact that there was a trial for the first time [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=207.38s)]
*  in our history, a criminal trial during an election season, is that the American voters [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=211.48s)]
*  got a chance to see and decide for themselves whether this is the kind of case that should [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  have been brought. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  And they decided, and that's why in 10 days President Trump was going to assume the office [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=224.57999999999998s)]
*  of the President of the United States. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=229.48s)]
*  And certainly we're here for the court to sentence President Trump to an unconditional [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=232.68s)]
*  discharge. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=237.48s)]
*  And for that, it's a very sad day. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=239.28s)]
*  It's a sad day for President Trump and his family and friends. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=242.57999999999998s)]
*  But it's also, in counsel's view, a sad day for this country because this was a case without [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=246.38s)]
*  a doubt that was brought by a district attorney who promised that he would go after President [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=254.98s)]
*  Trump if elected and felt like he had to go through with that promise. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=262.98s)]
*  And so that's sad. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=267.98s)]
*  And I hope, and I know that President Trump shares his view, that this will never happen [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  again in this country. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=274.68s)]
*  And so we certainly understand where we are today. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=277.48s)]
*  We very much intend on pursuing an appeal of this verdict and what happened during this [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=282.38s)]
*  investigation. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=290.38s)]
*  And we certainly believe that the only appropriate sentence, if one's to be imposed at all, which [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=292.78s)]
*  we very much believe it shouldn't be and that the case should be dismissed, is a sentence [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=299.08s)]
*  of an unconditional discharge. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=304.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=307.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=309.48s)]
*  Would your client like to be heard? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=310.88s)]
*  Yes, thank you, Your Honor. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=314.18s)]
*  This has been a very terrible experience. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=316.58s)]
*  I think it's been a tremendous setback for New York and the New York court system. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=319.48s)]
*  This is a case that Alvin Bragg did not want to bring. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=324.98s)]
*  He thought it was, from what I read and from what I hear, inappropriately handled before [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=330.38s)]
*  he got there. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=338.58s)]
*  A gentleman from a law firm came in and acted as a district attorney. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=340.58000000000004s)]
*  And that gentleman, from what I heard, was criminal or almost criminal in what he did. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=346.08000000000004s)]
*  It was very inappropriate. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  It was somebody involved with my political opponent. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=355.68s)]
*  Part of the records that we're talking about, they're saying, I just noticed, he said I [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=360.58000000000004s)]
*  was falsifying business records. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=365.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, the falsification of business records, as they say, it was calling illegal expense [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=368.78000000000003s)]
*  in the books where everybody could see them, illegal expense. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=374.18s)]
*  In other words, that legal fees or legal expense were put down as legal expense by accountants. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=376.88s)]
*  They weren't put down by me. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=383.68s)]
*  They were put down by accountants. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=384.68s)]
*  I didn't call them construction, concrete work. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=386.08s)]
*  I didn't call them electrical work. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=389.58s)]
*  I didn't call them any. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=391.48s)]
*  They called a legal fee or a legal expense a legal expense. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=392.48s)]
*  And for this, I got indicted. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=395.78s)]
*  It's incredible, actually. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=399.38s)]
*  Now, if you look, my attorney alluded to it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=401.47999999999996s)]
*  The top legal scholars and legal pundits in this country, the ones that are quoted all [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=405.28s)]
*  the time on television that are making their views felt and highly respected people, have [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=412.38s)]
*  said, everyone, virtually everyone that I know of, haven't seen any to the contrary. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=419.38s)]
*  Not one. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=424.88s)]
*  And none of these people are not exactly friends of mine, to put it mildly. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=425.88s)]
*  But they all said this is a case that should have never been brought into injustice of [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=429.88s)]
*  justice. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=435.58s)]
*  Very respected. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=436.58s)]
*  Jonathan Turley, Andy McCarthy, Judge David Rifkin, a wonderful man who just passed away, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=439.28s)]
*  by the way, Greg Jarrett, Ellie Honig from CNN of all places. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=446.58s)]
*  CNN said that Paul Ingrosje, Alan Dershowitz, they all said this is not a case that should [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=454.28s)]
*  be brought. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=461.38s)]
*  It's not. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=462.38s)]
*  Think about legal expenses are down as legal expenses. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=463.38s)]
*  And I get indicted for business records. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=466.88s)]
*  Everybody should be so accurate. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=469.08s)]
*  It's been a political witch hunt. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=472.38s)]
*  It was done to damage my reputation so that I'd lose the election. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=473.88s)]
*  And obviously that didn't work. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=478.78s)]
*  And the people of our country got to see this firsthand because they watched the case [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=480.58s)]
*  in your courtroom. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=484.47999999999996s)]
*  They got to see this firsthand and then they voted and I won and got the largest number [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=485.88s)]
*  of votes by far of any Republican candidate in history. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=490.47999999999996s)]
*  And won, as you know, all seven swing states. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=495.58s)]
*  Won conclusively all seven swing states. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=499.58s)]
*  And won the popularity, the popular vote by millions and millions of votes. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=503.08s)]
*  And they've been watching you try. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=508.58s)]
*  So they understood it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=510.38s)]
*  I wasn't allowed to use the lawyer client privilege or the reliance on counsel. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=512.48s)]
*  I had a lawyer that made this deal and he admitted that. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=517.98s)]
*  And he was also a totally discredited person. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=522.18s)]
*  We weren't allowed to use the information from the Southern District that totally discredited [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=524.78s)]
*  him. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=528.98s)]
*  It wasn't allowed to be put in. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=529.98s)]
*  And that was terrible. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=531.68s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=533.18s)]
*  And this is a man who's got no standing. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=534.78s)]
*  He's been disbarred on other matters, unrelated. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=538.7800000000001s)]
*  And he was allowed to talk as though he were George Washington. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=544.1800000000001s)]
*  But he's not George Washington. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=547.58s)]
*  He shouldn't have been allowed. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=550.08s)]
*  The Southern District did a book of approximately 28 pages where they, I've never seen anything [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=551.2800000000001s)]
*  like it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=558.1800000000001s)]
*  They excoriated him. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=559.1800000000001s)]
*  You wouldn't let it be put into evidence. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=560.1800000000001s)]
*  So he was able to testify as a witness. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=562.58s)]
*  And I think it's a disgrace to the system. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=565.82s)]
*  I was under a gag order. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=568.4200000000001s)]
*  I'm the first president in history that was under a gag order where I couldn't talk about [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=569.82s)]
*  aspects of the case that are very important. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=573.72s)]
*  I guess I'm still under, so probably I won't do it now. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=575.62s)]
*  I assume I'm still under a gag order. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=578.82s)]
*  But the fact is that I'm totally innocent. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=582.0200000000001s)]
*  I did nothing wrong. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=586.4200000000001s)]
*  They talked about business records and the business records were extremely accurately [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=588.32s)]
*  counted. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=593.12s)]
*  I had nothing to do with them any of it. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=594.12s)]
*  That was done by an accountant or a bookkeeper who I think gave very credible testimony and [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=595.12s)]
*  was corroborated by everybody that was asked. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=600.42s)]
*  And with all that's happening in our country today, with a city that's burning to the ground, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=605.72s)]
*  one of our largest, most important cities burning to the ground, with wars that are [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=611.32s)]
*  uncontrollably going on, with all of the problems of inflation and attacks on countries and [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=616.52s)]
*  all of the horrible things that are going on, I got indicted over calling illegal expense [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=624.82s)]
*  illegal expense. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=630.12s)]
*  It was called illegal expense. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=631.12s)]
*  I just want to say I think it's an embarrassment to New York and New York has a lot of problems, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=633.9200000000001s)]
*  but this is a great embarrassment. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=639.12s)]
*  I believe that this and other cases that were brought, as you know, the DOJ is very much [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=640.72s)]
*  involved in this case. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=646.72s)]
*  It's because that's the political opponent they're talking about. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=647.9200000000001s)]
*  The DOJ is very involved. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=652.32s)]
*  You have a gentleman sitting right there from the DOJ who was from the DOJ's office. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=654.82s)]
*  He was also involved with the New York State Attorney General's case. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=658.62s)]
*  And he went from there to here. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=662.62s)]
*  He went around and did what he had to do. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=664.32s)]
*  He got them to move on me. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=666.32s)]
*  But in the meantime, I won the election and a massive landslide and the people of this [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=667.82s)]
*  country understand what's going on. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=673.82s)]
*  This has been a weaponization of government. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=675.62s)]
*  They call it lawfare. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=677.72s)]
*  It never happened to any extent like this, but never happened in our country before. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=679.52s)]
*  And I'd just like to explain that I was treated very, very unfairly. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=683.52s)]
*  And I thank you very much. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=688.52s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Trump. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=690.52s)]
*  All right. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=692.52s)]
*  So the headline, the president, like says he was treated very unfairly. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=693.52s)]
*  I want to bring back Jessica Levinson for more on this. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=697.52s)]
*  She's a CBS News legal contributor and a professor at Loyola Law School. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=699.52s)]
*  Jessica, I thought the most interesting of all the things that the president rambled [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=703.52s)]
*  on about with regards to his grievances, which are not new. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=707.62s)]
*  We've heard Donald Trump express grievance at many, many things over the course of the [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=711.62s)]
*  last eight years or so. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=716.62s)]
*  But I thought what was interesting is he ran through a list of legal scholars who agreed [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=718.42s)]
*  with him that this was politically motivated. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=724.22s)]
*  I know that that doesn't hold any precedence in a court of law, but it is interesting that [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=728.8199999999999s)]
*  there are people, some of them very, very respected criminal legal minds, who agreed [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=734.02s)]
*  with the president that this trial, this case should have never been brought. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=739.02s)]
*  What's your reaction to what he said on that audio? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=742.7199999999999s)]
*  So my reaction one is that we should be careful about making sure that all of those legal [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=746.52s)]
*  scholars really said this case should not have been brought. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=751.62s)]
*  What I certainly have heard is that this is not a typical case that you would bring. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=754.8199999999999s)]
*  That doesn't mean it's inappropriate. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=759.52s)]
*  It means what's not typical about this. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=761.12s)]
*  Typically speaking, the falsification of business records is a misdemeanor. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=763.92s)]
*  Typically speaking, you don't kick it up to a felony. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=767.62s)]
*  They did in this case. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=770.52s)]
*  Why based on what frankly is a somewhat novel theory that the falsification of business [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=772.22s)]
*  records was committed in order to commit or conceal another crime. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=778.22s)]
*  The jury was not asked to agree on what that other crime was. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=783.52s)]
*  It might have been tax fraud. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=787.22s)]
*  It might have been campaign finance violations. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=788.42s)]
*  The jury had to come to a unanimous verdict, but not as to which other crime was being [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=790.82s)]
*  committed or concealed by virtue of the falsification of business records. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=798.4200000000001s)]
*  So all of which is to say, is this the typical bread and butter case? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=803.22s)]
*  Certainly falsification of business records cases are brought all of the time. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=808.0200000000001s)]
*  Now, this particular set of facts and this particular theory is not brought all the time. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=812.62s)]
*  It is rare. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=819.22s)]
*  That doesn't mean that it's inappropriate. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=819.82s)]
*  It means it's not what we typically see. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=822.12s)]
*  Is there something to the idea that people would not have been looking at this if we [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=824.12s)]
*  weren't talking about the former president of the United States? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=828.5200000000001s)]
*  I think that is fair. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=831.72s)]
*  I also think it is fair. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=833.22s)]
*  And we talked about this with respect to people on the other side of the political aisle to [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=834.22s)]
*  say once you look, even if you wouldn't have looked otherwise, there's no obligation to [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=839.0200000000001s)]
*  look away if you see wrongdoing. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=844.32s)]
*  And yet the president-elect has changed what he said about that payment to Stormy Daniels [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=847.22s)]
*  many, many times. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=854.82s)]
*  If you recall, Jessica, originally he said he didn't know anything about it, that reporters [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=856.02s)]
*  should check with Michael Cohen. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=861.12s)]
*  Then he ultimately admitted that he authorized that payment to Stormy Daniels. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=862.4200000000001s)]
*  But here in this audio tape we just heard, he was talking about it in almost a different [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=866.32s)]
*  way, like that it wasn't a payment to a former porn star. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=871.52s)]
*  Right. He was saying this is a legal payment. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=876.22s)]
*  It was logged as a legal payment. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=878.72s)]
*  I, you know, I don't know how else to say this other than obviously this is a different [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=881.52s)]
*  characterization than the one that we've previously heard. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=886.72s)]
*  And we should be clear that the jury has spoken and found that there was the falsification [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=889.82s)]
*  of business records. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=895.22s)]
*  The jury unanimously found that he was guilty on 34 felony counts. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=896.02s)]
*  You do not find guilt on 34 felony counts if members of the jury think this was a legal [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=902.62s)]
*  payment for legal services. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=909.02s)]
*  All right, Jessica Levinson, always great to have you. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=911.42s)]
*  Brilliant analysis, my friend. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=914.22s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=915.62s)]
*  Have a wonderful weekend. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym3FKE_q78s&t=916.62s)]
