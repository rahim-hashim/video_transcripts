# Hamas delays next hostage release, accusing Israel of violating ceasefire
**CBS News:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U)
*  Hamas says the next release of hostages, which was part of this elaborately negotiated ceasefire [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=0.0s)]
*  agreement, is now delayed. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=5.48s)]
*  Because it says, Israel is violating the very terms of that underlying ceasefire agreement. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=7.96s)]
*  Lee Kinneary is tracking the latest and comes to us from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=13.36s)]
*  Here in Tel Aviv, that announcement that there may be further delay in bringing those hostages [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=18.12s)]
*  home who've already been held by Hamas for nearly 500 days is unacceptable. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=22.64s)]
*  The feeling really is that now isn't even soon enough. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=27.919999999999998s)]
*  There simply is no time to waste after the public watched in horror over the weekend [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  as three male hostages were returned, looking emaciated and weak. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=35.76s)]
*  They were in much worse condition than hostages we'd seen in previous weeks, and the concern [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=40.28s)]
*  is rising. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=44.8s)]
*  Hamas, however, appeared strong, parading them on stage. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=45.8s)]
*  And now they say the suspension of these exchanges is a reaction to Israel violating terms of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  the ceasefire. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=55.16s)]
*  They say Israel's delayed some Palestinians from returning to their homes. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=56.22s)]
*  They say that there have even been some targeted with gunfire and that essential aid has been [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=60.339999999999996s)]
*  prevented from entering the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=64.94s)]
*  Now this ceasefire has been fragile. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=67.64s)]
*  Though the bombing has stopped, three Palestinians were shot and killed this weekend. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=69.78s)]
*  Israel said they got too close to the border and it was a protective measure. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=74.98s)]
*  Now Hamas did leave a door open with this new statement, saying they deliberately gave [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=78.84s)]
*  notice before the next scheduled hostage exchange so that mediators can help correct the alleged [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=84.1s)]
*  violations, namely letting more aid into the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=89.02s)]
*  The next exchange is scheduled for Saturday, so we've so far seen 16 hostages released [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=93.33999999999999s)]
*  in this first phase of the agreement, but there are still more than 70 hostages in Gaza, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=99.61999999999999s)]
*  including two who are American citizens believed to be alive. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=104.69999999999999s)]
*  Israel's defense minister has said Hamas' announcement in itself is a violation of the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=109.46s)]
*  ceasefire and has instructed his military to prepare at the highest level of readiness [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=113.3s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=118.41999999999999s)]
*  And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called a security cabinet meeting for Tuesday [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=119.66s)]
*  morning. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=124.02s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=125.25999999999999s)]
*  Lee Kanaeri in Tel Aviv. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=126.25999999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ6k5_pd40U&t=128.29999999999998s)]
