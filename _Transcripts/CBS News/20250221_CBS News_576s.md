# Viktor Orbán's political director on Trump, Bannon's CPAC salute and more
**CBS News:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY)
*  For years and years, CPAC was a domestic political event. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=0.0s)]
*  Conservative luminaries, aspiring conservatives, came to deliver remarks at that annual convention [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  here in Washington. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  This year, as in a couple of years past, many leaders from other parts of the world have [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=13.9s)]
*  come to appear. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=18.88s)]
*  And this is the largest, I think, collection. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=19.88s)]
*  Got conservative leaders from the U.K., Spain, Poland, Italy, and many others appearing at [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=21.64s)]
*  this event to burnish their image and their messaging. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=29.2s)]
*  One of them, the political director and adviser to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=32.48s)]
*  who took the stage with CPAC chair Matt Schlapp yesterday. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=37.32s)]
*  CBS News chief foreign affairs correspondent and Face the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=41.72s)]
*  sat down with him earlier today. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  They began by talking about the growing alliance between conservatives here and in Hungary. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=49.0s)]
*  CPAC is playing a very important role. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=56.64s)]
*  It's growing, and this movement could identify some topics where we share concerns, like [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  in connection with the future of the Western civilization, like migration, gender issues, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=65.44s)]
*  role of Christianity, and so on and so on. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=72.8s)]
*  There was a bit of a scandal. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=76.72s)]
*  Today, the president of the French far-right party national rally, Jordan Bardella, said [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=78.72s)]
*  that he is going to cancel his speech at CPAC after a gesture alluding to Nazi ideology, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=84.28s)]
*  he said, was made that seems to be a reference to what Steve Bannon did when he took the stage. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=90.12s)]
*  How did you interpret what happened? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=97.64s)]
*  Well, in Hungary, and so far as I understood, among the participants, there is zero tolerance [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=100.12s)]
*  on anti-Semitism. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=111.0s)]
*  This is what I was realizing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=113.24s)]
*  And there are some Jewish and Israeli participants also. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=117.88s)]
*  So I don't see the scandal, honestly. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=122.28s)]
*  What did you think Steve Bannon was doing? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=125.83999999999999s)]
*  I think that if those Jewish participants and Israeli participants are saying that there [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=130.04s)]
*  was nothing anti-Semitic, then most probably there wasn't. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=136.92s)]
*  I don't know if you understood. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=142.36s)]
*  But if there was, that would be unacceptable. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=145.08s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=148.52s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=149.56s)]
*  Trump ally Steve Bannon has called your boss, Viktor Orban, Trump before Trump. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  He has become very influential when it comes to the MAGA movement. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=157.0s)]
*  How do you see Orban and Trump working together? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=161.8s)]
*  Well, President Trump is representing the interest of the United States, and my prime [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=168.68s)]
*  minister represents the interest of Hungary. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=173.24s)]
*  And we have some shared visions, shared problems we want to solve, and we are ready to cooperate. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=175.56s)]
*  We mentioned migration, so fighting, pushing back illegal migration. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=184.2s)]
*  That's a top priority for us as well. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  Your prime minister has been on social media praising what President Trump has done, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=191.8s)]
*  with USAID, with the international projects that the U.S. supported. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk, of course, has said USAID must be destroyed. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=203.96s)]
*  What do you find so threatening about the U.S. projects in Hungary? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=207.88s)]
*  Now, that's a huge scandal, because American people and American taxpayers' money [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=212.36s)]
*  were used for pushing liberal progressive ideology. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=219.96s)]
*  They were financing the opposition directly and indirectly, opposition media, opposition [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=224.6s)]
*  NGOs. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=231.96s)]
*  And, you know, if you're coming from a country which wants to take itself seriously, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=233.72s)]
*  that you cannot allow that politics is financed by a foreign country. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=239.48s)]
*  It doesn't matter which country it is. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=245.72s)]
*  It's a question of sovereignty, whether you are ready to preserve your sovereignty, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=247.32s)]
*  which means that no foreign funding in politics. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=251.72s)]
*  And this is what they were doing. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=256.6s)]
*  And we are very happy that this operation seems to be stopping. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=259.32s)]
*  So USAID in 2022 launched a program to strengthen democracy in Hungary, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=264.2s)]
*  that's what they called it, and civil society. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=269.64s)]
*  And it included financially supporting independent media in Hungary. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=272.36s)]
*  That's in part because 85% of the media in your country is under government control. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=277.56s)]
*  But it's not true. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=283.56s)]
*  This is a problem. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=284.6s)]
*  It was portrayed as it is kind of a defense for democracy, but in reality, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=285.72s)]
*  it's just the financial support for those who were opposing the government, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=290.84000000000003s)]
*  because United States' previous administration wanted to get rid of the Hungarian government, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=296.12s)]
*  because we were opposing their war policy. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=301.8s)]
*  We were not on the same side with the migration policy. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=304.12s)]
*  And they were used that funds to promote the opposition. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=307.32s)]
*  It's not about democracy. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=312.2s)]
*  It's always how it is framed. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=313.48s)]
*  But everybody knows that it's different. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=316.12s)]
*  So Reporters Without Borders says that FIDA is the ruling party that you are part of, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=319.64s)]
*  controls 80% of the country's media. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=324.36s)]
*  The State Department during Donald Trump estimated approximately 85% [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=327.08s)]
*  of all Hungarian media outlets are under the control of a government-friendly owner. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=333.56s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not true. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=338.2s)]
*  The Trump administration was wrong about that? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=340.6s)]
*  We have a wonderful—yeah, probably the deep state was providing this information, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=342.44s)]
*  false information for the president. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=347.24s)]
*  So it's like Hungarian language is a unique language. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=350.28s)]
*  It's a small market, 12 million people, the country itself, it's 10 million. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=353.96s)]
*  So it's very hard to follow how it's going on. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=358.68s)]
*  If you come from Hungary, you follow the Hungarian media environment, it's obvious [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=360.76s)]
*  that the pro-governmental and anti-governmental or critical voices are very loudly heard. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=366.6s)]
*  It's a much better and healthier environment than in many other Western countries. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=373.48s)]
*  So this is the reality. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=379.64s)]
*  Every voice can be heard. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=381.0s)]
*  In Hungary, the U.S. money was specifically to try to delegitimize the current government, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=382.84s)]
*  and I think it's unacceptable. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=391.24s)]
*  Margaret, Brennan joins me here at the table. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=394.44s)]
*  Margaret, that's quite an accusation from Orban's top political adviser. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=396.44s)]
*  It is. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=401.08s)]
*  It also tracks the things that Vladimir Putin has said. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=402.03999999999996s)]
*  Hungary's government, very friendly with the Russian government, but these accusations [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=405.56s)]
*  about what the State Department USAID have done is interesting because it's characterized [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=410.36s)]
*  as part by Orban of this international conservative movement. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=417.72s)]
*  And when you hear that there is a connection between ideology and media coverage and that [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=423.40000000000003s)]
*  kind of language that they're using there, it deserves further digging in. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=432.44s)]
*  And that's why I cited back the Reporters Without Borders stats, Committee to Protect [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=437.8s)]
*  Journalists. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=441.88s)]
*  The Trump Justice Department, State Department numbers, 85 percent. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=442.44s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=445.96000000000004s)]
*  And so there is this tendency within Hungary, repeatedly under the Orban government, whether [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=446.68s)]
*  it's media or whether it's the university, something that JD Vance, the vice president, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=451.56s)]
*  has praised. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=454.92s)]
*  Viktor Orban has consolidated control by bringing control of those entities into the arms or [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=455.8s)]
*  boards of groups that his cronies are on. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=463.32s)]
*  So it may not be directly under control of the state, but it's under control of boards [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=466.52s)]
*  of directors manned by his cronies. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=471.64s)]
*  And that is whether it's the media or whether it's the universities. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=473.96s)]
*  So I wanted to dig into this, you know, exactly what the thinking is, because I find this [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=477.08s)]
*  idea that this is a global movement really interesting, particularly when we hear conservative [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=482.28s)]
*  leaders in this country praise Viktor Orban. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=487.15999999999997s)]
*  And it comes down to a definition of what is free speech and how loudly people can be [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=489.79999999999995s)]
*  heard. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=494.84s)]
*  And if you have 80 to 85 percent of the media in your country and you're the government [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=495.08s)]
*  and it's generally aligned with you and there are some voices that can be heard, you're [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=499.96s)]
*  probably very happy that voices can be heard. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=503.56s)]
*  It's all about proportion and definition. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=507.71999999999997s)]
*  It is. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=509.8s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=510.44s)]
*  I mean, we're having this ongoing debate over what free speech and censorship is in [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=511.64s)]
*  the context of where it's said and how it's said matters. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=515.56s)]
*  Clearly, Viktor Orban also rewrote the Constitution when he came to power. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=517.72s)]
*  So he has redefined a lot of these things and done so with the judiciary. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=521.88s)]
*  So I think it deserves a second look when we see some of these international leaders [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=525.48s)]
*  appear at CPAC, whether it's here in Washington or the next conference major, which is actually [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=529.72s)]
*  going to be in Budapest in May. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=534.2s)]
*  They are hosting CPAC in Hungary. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=536.12s)]
*  And so understanding more about what some of these right-wing governments are doing [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=539.48s)]
*  and what is being either mimicked or in some ways looked at for inspiration here, I think [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=545.48s)]
*  deserves some tracking on our part here in the U.S. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=552.36s)]
*  I know it feels far away, but when you wonder why is a small country like Hungary getting [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=554.84s)]
*  such a platform at the White House and at Mar-a-Lago, it's some of these conservative [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=560.2s)]
*  ideas. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=564.7600000000001s)]
*  That's how they frame it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=565.24s)]
*  But I don't know that conservative is the right word for it. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=566.84s)]
*  It's some road mapping we need to keep very close attention on. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=569.6400000000001s)]
*  Margaret Brennan, thank you very, very much. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZLT58oT9xY&t=573.72s)]
