# Residents start to return home to destruction from Los Angeles wildfires
**CBS News:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI)
*  Alright, we want to bring you up to speed on those five major wildfires that are still burning in California at this hour [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=0.0s)]
*  Officials say that the Kenneth fire is now being investigated as potential arson [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=4.96s)]
*  This has some residents head back for the very first time since they were forced to flee [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=9.68s)]
*  I was just I just got off the phone with somebody and as you can see there's nothing left and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=14.44s)]
*  I've been here for about an hour and a half and I don't want to leave it's home [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=19.56s)]
*  so I [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=24.76s)]
*  I [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=26.880000000000003s)]
*  Really can't put in towards [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  We each walked out with two pairs of clothing [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=30.32s)]
*  Changes and that's all that we have [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=34.36s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Tom Hanson has been following this story all week for us and he joins me now to talk about this [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  So Tom before we talk about some of the voices and the folks that you've been speaking to just bring us up to speed on [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  Where the fires are this morning what you're seeing? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=51.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, we're just near the Eden fire which is about burned [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=53.88s)]
*  14,000 acres so far [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  0% containment so very much still an active situation [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=61.6s)]
*  You know, this is Alta Dena, which is near Pasadena [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=65.28s)]
*  This is a residential area a lot of middle-class people and I do just want to give you an extent of what we're seeing on the ground [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=68.36s)]
*  Here as the Sun comes up. We're getting a better scope of the damage just in this area. It's utter destruction Vlad [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=74.84s)]
*  It is jaw-dropping to see house after house just wiped off of the map and honestly based on this wreckage [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=80.4s)]
*  You can get a sense of the ferocity of these flames. It is indistinguishable [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  You cannot see you cannot figure out what is what within this rubble here? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=92.16s)]
*  It's all just ash and rubble. The only thing I can really make out is an oven over here [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=97.8s)]
*  Outside of that it is it is pretty much just debris [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=103.32s)]
*  And so that just tells you how ferocious these flames have been and how quick they moved through this area [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=106.2s)]
*  Consider a wall of flames just tearing through this residential area now based on what we've heard from residents [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=112.2s)]
*  This neighborhood was lush. It was green. It was idyllic a lot of middle-class people living here [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=119.0s)]
*  It's going to be a long road for the people who choose to return [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=125.0s)]
*  But people we've spoken to are saying they may just pick up and leave [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=129.56s)]
*  Because they don't exactly know what to do in an environment like this where there's not much to come back to you Vlad [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=132.84s)]
*  Yeah, Tom. We were all remarking after your [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=138.04s)]
*  Piece this morning on CBS mornings when we listened to some of the voices of people who just [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=141.56s)]
*  Were devastated by the loss and didn't know what to do those who came back to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  What was once a beautiful and thriving community and only returned to see rubble and smoldering [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  Embers and I remember we all turned to each other and I said to gail [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  I wonder if if people are even going to want to build back in an area that is so susceptible now [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=163.0s)]
*  To climate change into these devastating fires. Are you hearing more of that people saying? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=168.44s)]
*  You know what they may just pick up and go completely [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=173.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean dale fielder is a perfect example of that the guy that we interviewed yesterday [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=179.16s)]
*  We met him at a shelter in the middle of the city [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  That we interviewed yesterday [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=186.52s)]
*  We met him at a shelter not too far away from here in pasadena that was housing some [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=187.72000000000003s)]
*  1200 people who are in very similar circumstances a lot of them from the altadena area people are [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=193.3s)]
*  Frustrated with the fact that the fire crews didn't come fast enough according to them [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=199.70000000000002s)]
*  And they are pretty much at a loss. I think there's a profound sense of loss amongst entire communities [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  Especially altadena and let me tell you when you drive through this neighborhood [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=212.70000000000002s)]
*  There are downed power lines everywhere. There are full blocks that are just completely wiped away from the flames [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=217.5s)]
*  Occasionally because as you know, these wildfires are somewhat fickle. There are homes that are still standing here and there but that is the minority [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=225.88s)]
*  This is a community that is deeply impacted by this and it's still [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=234.86s)]
*  From my vantage point [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=239.5s)]
*  very hard to wrap my head around the fact that this is still an active fire because so much of this land has burned and [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=241.18s)]
*  You kind of wonder what's left? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=247.9s)]
*  At to to to use as fuel for the flames [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=250.22s)]
*  But this this fire is still expanding zero percent contained [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=253.5s)]
*  And so a lot of people are saying, you know [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=257.26s)]
*  If if I don't have anything to return to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=259.82s)]
*  Lord only knows if i'm going to be able to ensure a new home if I want to rebuild [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=262.78s)]
*  It's might be just time to pick up and leave and that's a heartbreaking [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=267.9s)]
*  Revelation for so many people here. Yeah, you're absolutely right about that [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=271.65999999999997s)]
*  Tom, let me ask you about something. We were just reported as we were introducing you which is [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=275.82s)]
*  What police are saying about the kenneth fire that an arrest has been made. What are you learning about that? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=280.14s)]
*  Yeah, well what we're learning according to the pio [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=286.7s)]
*  and the their their twitter account is that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=290.14s)]
*  They have come out and said that they have not been able to identify a definitive link to this individual who is in custody [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=292.94s)]
*  And the kenneth fire, but obviously those reports have been circulating the kenneth fire about [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=300.14000000000004s)]
*  35% contained it's actually just north of that catastrophic wildfire that hit the palisades [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=305.48s)]
*  That we've been covering throughout the week [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=312.38s)]
*  You know, it's an area [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=314.94s)]
*  That is near some higher end communities [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=316.78000000000003s)]
*  Hidden hills, for example [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=320.32s)]
*  Calabasas those are in that area. So homes are certainly under threat there but one [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=322.53999999999996s)]
*  One shred of good news in all of this vlad is that these powerful gusts these santa ana winds [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=328.08s)]
*  They appear to be calming down for now [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  And so fire crews will be able to use this weekend to really jump into action do a lot of those air drops [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=336.4s)]
*  And drop a ton of water where they can to try to fight the flames [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=343.28s)]
*  But really this is just a city that feels like it's on fire pretty much any which way you look [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=347.92s)]
*  Vlad at the at the current moment. Yeah [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  Tom hansen, thank you very much for what you've been doing all week long bringing these stories [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=357.44s)]
*  To those of us who can only imagine the pain and suffering that people are going through. We appreciate it. My friend. Stay safe [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD7UxskbjFI&t=362.32000000000005s)]
