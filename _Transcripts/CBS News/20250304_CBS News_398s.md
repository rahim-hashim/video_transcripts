# Sen. Ruben Gallego calls DOGE firings "dumb," "stupid," "arbitrary"
**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY)
*  Welcome back to our continuing pregame coverage of President Trump's speech to a joint session [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=0.0s)]
*  of Congress. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=5.88s)]
*  Several Democratic lawmakers at that speech are bringing fired federal workers as an act [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=6.88s)]
*  of protest, protesting what they regard as the president's either reckless or too quick [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  culling of the federal workforce. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=18.76s)]
*  One of them is Arizona Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego, freshman senator, elected in [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=20.92s)]
*  the last campaign. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=27.96s)]
*  Senator, it's great to see you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=29.2s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=30.2s)]
*  What is your beef with the reductions in the federal workforce? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=31.48s)]
*  Are you against all reductions to the federal workforce? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=36.36s)]
*  Or is there something specifically you want Elon Musk and President Trump to do that they [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=39.8s)]
*  haven't done so far? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=43.54s)]
*  Well, look, I want them to actually be thoughtful about this. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=44.96s)]
*  For example, some of these reductions in workforce have actually been putting Arizona in danger. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  They've reduced the amount of workers that are actually clearing our underbrush in northern [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=53.64s)]
*  Arizona. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=57.24s)]
*  We have had a very dry season. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=58.28s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=60.64s)]
*  A dry winter season means we're going to have a very, very hot burning fire season this [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=61.64s)]
*  summer. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=65.76s)]
*  Now, these young 20, 21 year old quoters from San Francisco don't really understand northern [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=66.76s)]
*  Arizona. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=71.64s)]
*  They don't understand our brush fires, but somehow they looked upon the little equations [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=72.64s)]
*  and algorithms and decided that this is something that we should reduce. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=77.6s)]
*  That puts Arizona in danger. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=80.76s)]
*  Also I'm against the fact that they're just arbitrarily firing veterans. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=82.68s)]
*  Veterans that have been serving this country both in the military and now as government [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=86.76s)]
*  workers and without any notice, even though they were qualified people, even though they [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  have served their country dutifully, they were given just massive layoffs and that's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=95.4s)]
*  affecting them personally and their families. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=100.28s)]
*  We can find efficiencies. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  There are ways that we can actually cut waste, but we should do it in a thoughtful manner [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  that protects the American citizen every day and make sure that these workers are taking [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=110.28s)]
*  care of themselves. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=115.6s)]
*  At the same time, we could do it while saving taxpayer money, but the way that these guys [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=117.08s)]
*  are doing it, these Doge boys, Elon Musk are doing it, they're doing it correctly and they're [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=120.74s)]
*  only doing it so they could give tax cuts to the very, very, very rich and the American [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=125.6s)]
*  taxpayer themselves are the ones that are hurting. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=130.56s)]
*  TSMC has a very large footprint in Arizona. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=134.28s)]
*  They are a manufacturer of computer chips, microchips. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=138.24s)]
*  President Trump announced another $100 billion investment. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=143.44s)]
*  I'm not sure if that's all brand new money or money that was sort of scheduled and enhanced, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=145.48s)]
*  but you had to have been at least nominally supportive of that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=149.88s)]
*  I'm not going to be supportive, I'm kidding, I'm excited. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=153.64s)]
*  This is a great Arizona and American story. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=157.44s)]
*  I'm not going to root against Arizona and the United States because Trump is in charge. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=160.28s)]
*  This is a great, great thing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=166.0s)]
*  They're going to add three more fabrication of microchip plants in Arizona, a total of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=167.72s)]
*  40% of all the chips in this country are going to be built in Arizona. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=174.8s)]
*  I am proud that I worked on the Chips Act when it was under Biden. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=178.8s)]
*  I'm probably going to work on this under Trump. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=181.52s)]
*  Of course, this is a great story for America and we should all be proud that this is happening. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=183.4s)]
*  How do you evaluate President Trump's moves to stop the flow of illegal immigrants into [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  our country, specifically Arizona? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  Look, I'm very happy that we've seen some of the flows of illegal immigration crossing [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=194.76000000000002s)]
*  across the border at an all-time low. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=201.24s)]
*  This is something that we've been talking about as Democrats, is why when I was in the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=203.42s)]
*  House and still in the Senate, I've been advocating for a comprehensive border security bill because [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=207.5s)]
*  what we want to do is be able to continue these sustained gains that started under Biden [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=213.5s)]
*  and are continuing under Trump. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=218.77999999999997s)]
*  What's happening right now is a good thing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=220.73999999999998s)]
*  The amount of illegal border crossers is at an all-time low. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=222.57999999999998s)]
*  But in order for us to be able to sustain that, it requires us to actually have a long-term [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=225.89999999999998s)]
*  plan how that looks. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=229.89999999999998s)]
*  Right now we're spending a lot of money. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=231.5s)]
*  Border Patrol, ICE, they're actually borrowing money from other parts of DHS right now in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=233.54s)]
*  order to pay for what's happening right now. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=237.66s)]
*  So why don't we work together? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=240.3s)]
*  Why don't Republicans, Democrats and the president work together to have a long-term plan for [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=241.66s)]
*  how to keep the illegal immigrants coming across the border and actually figure out [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=246.02s)]
*  what to do with the people that have been here for long term, the people that are the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=250.58s)]
*  Dreamers or the sons and daughters of American citizens or sorry, the parents of American [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=253.76s)]
*  citizens that have no criminal records, that we should find a way for them to actually [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=258.62s)]
*  be part of this American dream. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=261.9s)]
*  There's a way to do this all. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=263.26s)]
*  But I think it is a success and I think Democrats and Republicans should recognize that lower [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=264.98s)]
*  border crossings, illegal border crossing is a good thing for this country. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=269.62s)]
*  I wonder if I could ask you, Senator, about the FAA and about the park service. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=274.86s)]
*  Both have been affected by some of these reductions in the federal workforce. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=280.4s)]
*  Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix is the gateway to your tourist industry throughout the state [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=284.90000000000003s)]
*  and national park service employees are crucial to several national parks in and around Arizona. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=289.14s)]
*  What is your level of concern as we move towards spring and summer and what is clearly a big [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=295.90000000000003s)]
*  part of your tourist season there? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=301.02000000000004s)]
*  Well, we are actually now in our high season. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=303.5s)]
*  People are coming to Arizona right now because it is beautiful in Arizona. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=306.62s)]
*  Can't say the same for other parts of the country, which is why it's a big draw. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=310.7s)]
*  People are coming for spring training, but we also have abundant national parks and forests [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=313.73999999999995s)]
*  that people come and visit. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=319.02s)]
*  The Grand Canyon, for example, right now is a big draw to people. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=320.41999999999996s)]
*  But because of this president's cuts and Elon Musk's arbitrary cuts, the Grand Canyon right [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=324.34s)]
*  now is having difficulty getting people through the gates, picking up garbage. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=330.65999999999997s)]
*  If you get in some type of injury or in trouble in the Grand Canyon, it may take longer for [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=334.62s)]
*  someone to get to you. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=339.02s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=340.97999999999996s)]
*  I talked to you about the problem when it comes to forest fires, and there's no investment [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=342.02000000000004s)]
*  right now in cleaning out and clearing out the underbrush from a national forest. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=345.42s)]
*  That's very dangerous. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=350.66s)]
*  Sky Harbor is now becoming one of the most busiest airports in the country. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=352.82s)]
*  And when you have, unfortunately, some FAA controllers that are being released, relieved, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=358.18s)]
*  or fired and not being replaced, that causes backlogs, which was already existent even [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=364.98s)]
*  before these arbitrary cuts. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=370.18s)]
*  It's important for us to understand you can have cuts, but you don't have to do it in [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=373.42s)]
*  a stupid way. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=377.46s)]
*  What Elon Musk and his people are doing with the approval of Donald Trump, it's just dumb, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=378.82s)]
*  it's stupid, it's arbitrary. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=384.58s)]
*  And to the end of the day, it's going to only cost the government more. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=385.58s)]
*  It's not going to actually save us any money. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=390.14s)]
*  Arizona's freshman Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=392.54s)]
*  Thank you very much, sir. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5aoebT5kFY&t=396.02s)]
