# Trump on Nippon Steel as he meets with Japan's Shigeru Ishiba
**CBS News:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q)
*  What a day it's been already taking notes in real time all eyes on the White House as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=0.0s)]
*  President Donald Trump and the Japanese Prime Minister go head to head on dollars and defense. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=5.44s)]
*  Big questions loom at this hour, not the least of which could President Trump change the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=10.88s)]
*  course for Japan's Nippon Steels blocked bid to buy U.S. Steel. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=15.26s)]
*  I'm Reid Cowen, welcome in. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=20.36s)]
*  So as soon as the two leaders step in front of a podium for a joint news conference, you'll [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=21.6s)]
*  see it right here on CBS News 24 seven. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=25.48s)]
*  It is one we are waiting for. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=27.84s)]
*  So think about it like this. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=29.16s)]
*  What's in the meeting of Ishiba's Japan and what's in the meeting for Trump's vision for [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=31.76s)]
*  America? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=36.08s)]
*  This we know Mr. Ishiba has been hunkered down with his advisors for a week preparing [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=37.28s)]
*  for that very big meeting. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=41.66s)]
*  We're talking about strategy, the big issues, how much Japan pays for its own defense and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=42.96s)]
*  what more can Donald Trump squeeze out of Japan to get that nation to pay more for its [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  own security? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=53.84s)]
*  So here's what the president had to say just a moment ago. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=54.84s)]
*  We will be discussing North Korea and many other things we'll be spending pretty much [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=58.28s)]
*  today. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=64.0s)]
*  And but that's always a topic. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=65.0s)]
*  Mr. President, have you changed your mind about the sale of U.S. Steel? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=66.8s)]
*  No, I think we're going to be discussing that today. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=70.52s)]
*  No, I haven't. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=73.92s)]
*  And I hear we'll have some pretty good information on that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=74.92s)]
*  That's our Weijia Jiang asking that question. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  CBS News Chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes joining us now. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=80.76s)]
*  All eyes on that U.S. Steel bid. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=84.0s)]
*  We know that President Biden put his foot in the door and said no. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=85.8s)]
*  It looked at the time like President Donald Trump was with Biden on that, which is sort [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=89.16s)]
*  of rare, right? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=94.24s)]
*  But now it seems like there's a little bit of an opening, Nancy. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=95.6s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=100.56s)]
*  Donald Trump is always somebody who likes to make a deal. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=101.56s)]
*  So let's see what the prime minister of Japan has to offer him in that meeting that is going [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=103.88s)]
*  on right now. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=109.4s)]
*  He has argued that steel is something that is so important to be made in the United States [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=111.56s)]
*  by U.S. companies. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=117.2s)]
*  But U.S. Steel itself has argued that it is going to have to lay off American workers [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=119.16s)]
*  if they don't get this all-important cash infusion from Nippon Steel, a Japanese company. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=123.94s)]
*  So the fact that President Trump told Weijia there that it's still up for discussion is [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=130.36s)]
*  really notable. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=137.5s)]
*  It is notable, especially given the fact that we have a president who was just voted in [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=139.08s)]
*  overwhelmingly by Americans on an America First agenda. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=143.16000000000003s)]
*  Do you think those layoffs is how he's going to, if this does get through, and we don't [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=147.4s)]
*  know that it's going to get through, is how he's going to have to sell it to the American public? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=151.12s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=156.44s)]
*  And this is one of these issues where I think the American public is split just like folks [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=157.44s)]
*  in the steel industry are split. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=161.66000000000003s)]
*  There are union members who actually support the deal and having the Japanese come in and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=163.32s)]
*  take over U.S. Steel. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=169.88s)]
*  They say that's the only way they're going to be able to keep their jobs and actually [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=171.04s)]
*  see the company grow. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  And so this is not a cut and dried issue that has to do with sending U.S. jobs overseas. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  In fact, quite the opposite. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  There has been this really compelling case made that actually bringing in foreign investment [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  would increase American jobs. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=189.88s)]
*  So we'll see if the president is willing to move on that at all over the course of this meeting. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=192.4s)]
*  He's going to be holding a press conference with the Japanese prime minister afterwards, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=197.9s)]
*  and I'm sure he'll get asked about it again. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=202.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=204.26000000000002s)]
*  And you know, we know that U.S. Steel is not the only game piece on the board, so to speak. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=205.26000000000002s)]
*  There's also the discussion of trying to get Japan to increase the amount of money that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=208.74s)]
*  they put forward for their own defense. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=213.38000000000002s)]
*  Any thought there that Japan may move on this to increase the percentage based on their [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=215.74s)]
*  gross domestic product? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=220.58s)]
*  They may have to because what President Trump is likely to do with Japan is something that [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=223.3s)]
*  he's been doing with other countries, which is threatening tariffs if they don't do what [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=228.38000000000002s)]
*  he wants. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=232.74s)]
*  It's part of the reason that he is threatening European countries with tariffs. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=234.18s)]
*  He has always believed, for example, he just brought it up there again in the Oval Office, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=237.98000000000002s)]
*  that European countries need to contribute more to NATO. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=241.5s)]
*  They did do that during his first term, but apparently not enough for President Trump. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=245.88000000000002s)]
*  So it's not surprising that that is a line item on the list of things to be discussed [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=251.18s)]
*  in the Oval Office today. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=257.26s)]
*  They'll also be talking, Reed, about China. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=258.98s)]
*  This is something that both Japan and the U.S. share concerns about Chinese influence [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=262.3s)]
*  in the region. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=268.46000000000004s)]
*  The U.S., as you know, has already gone ahead and slapped some tariffs, new tariffs, on [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=269.46000000000004s)]
*  Chinese goods, and the Chinese have retaliated, and that creates concerns for other countries [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=275.1s)]
*  in the region who worry that if there's a trade war, that that will mean higher prices [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=280.12s)]
*  for them as well. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=284.4s)]
*  So we're likely to hear, coming out of that meeting, more about that topic, too. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  We know that you will be there and bring us those reports as soon as they step out. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=291.76s)]
*  Nancy Cord is always great to talk to you on a Friday or any day there from the White House. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFrFk93g7Q&t=295.03999999999996s)]
