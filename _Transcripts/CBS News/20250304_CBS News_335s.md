# Watch: Trump arrives at Capitol for address to Congress
**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes)
*  Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=0.0s)]
*  The only guy I wait for is Paul. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=4.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=31.0s)]
*  He's just a little under 10 years ago. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=82.0s)]
*  He came down that escalator in New York. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=84.0s)]
*  Now he's coming down inside of the House chamber to the lectern. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=86.0s)]
*  And he has the Senate in the House behind him. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=91.0s)]
*  He has much of Wall Street behind him, as uncomfortable as they are with tariffs. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=94.0s)]
*  He has Silicon Valley epitomized by Elon Musk behind him in many respects. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=99.0s)]
*  The challenge for him, I'm told by those close to him, is just how far can President Trump push his power at this moment. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=104.0s)]
*  He has overcome an assassination attempt. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=111.0s)]
*  He was convicted of a crime last year in New York, faced civil criminal charges, a federal investigation. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=114.0s)]
*  Now back in the White House. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=120.0s)]
*  Can he really reframe the world, global politics and domestic politics, in his image? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=122.0s)]
*  This speech tonight is not just a speech, I'm told. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=128.0s)]
*  It's a statement about who he is and what kind of historic presidency he is trying to mount this time around. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=131.0s)]
*  And Bob, when you frame it that way, what a journey it has been since coming down that escalator in Trump Tower. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=138.0s)]
*  Let's go now to Scott McFarlane. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=144.0s)]
*  He is inside the chamber. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=146.0s)]
*  Scott, give us a feeling for what that's like right now. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=148.0s)]
*  You can see from my vantage point, Maurice, the Democrats largely are not standing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=150.0s)]
*  They're seated. They're not clapping. They're not moving as President Trump walks towards the dais. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=155.0s)]
*  Some of them you'll see, Maurice and John. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=161.0s)]
*  Some of the House Democrats are wearing these very bright pink blazers. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=164.0s)]
*  Members of the Democratic Women's Caucus. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=167.0s)]
*  They say that is a unified visual of protest against President Trump. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=169.0s)]
*  There will also be a few empty seats on the House Democratic side. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=174.0s)]
*  Several members are sitting this out, saying they can't be in the same room with Donald Trump at this moment. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=177.0s)]
*  This is his first time in this House chamber speaking to Congress since the January 6th riot by Trump supporters. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=182.0s)]
*  I'll also note this. Up here in the top level with me, Elon Musk, wearing a suit in the guest box. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=190.0s)]
*  He's standing and clapping next to the FBI Director, Cash Patel, and members of the Trump family. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=197.0s)]
*  They're seated to the President's left when he gets up to the dais and begins speaking. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=203.0s)]
*  We see the President there speaking to the combatant commanders. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=209.0s)]
*  You saw him shaking hands with the Supreme Court justices. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=213.0s)]
*  It is worth noting tonight the amount of power that is in the Capitol all at once. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=216.0s)]
*  We are told that the designated survivor tonight is VA Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Secretary Doug Collins, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=221.0s)]
*  who is in a secure location, according to our Olivia Rinaldi, because certainly this is a focus of those who wish us well. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=228.0s)]
*  And just as they go through another round of applause, Caitlin Huey-Burns is up on the hill. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=239.0s)]
*  Caitlin, what are Democrats doing in preparation for tonight? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=245.0s)]
*  Well, after this election, Democrats have been trying to figure their way out of the wilderness. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=251.0s)]
*  And they've been hearing an earful from their constituents back home who want them to do more, do what they can to oppose the President. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=256.0s)]
*  Remember, they are in the minority and are limited legislatively in what they can do. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=266.0s)]
*  But the House Minority Leader, Hakeem Jeffries, urged Democrats to show up today to show their strength in opposition to the President. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=271.0s)]
*  Remember, it just takes three Republicans to defect in order for Democrats to blow everything up here. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=281.0s)]
*  The majority that Republicans have is indeed fragile. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=289.0s)]
*  Democrats are trying to hold it together in opposition to this President. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=293.0s)]
*  And we'll see how they do it tonight. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=298.0s)]
*  Okay, so the speaker is supposed to introduce the President. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=302.0s)]
*  See if that happens as he vasts in the moment. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=306.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=313.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. Thank you very much. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3s5y0zvRes&t=331.0s)]
