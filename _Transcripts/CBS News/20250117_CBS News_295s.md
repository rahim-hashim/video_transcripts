# Why Trump moved his inauguration indoors
**CBS News:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw)
*  President-elect Trump says he is moving Monday's inauguration indoors because of the frigid [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=0.0s)]
*  temperatures expected in the Washington, D.C. metro area. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  It will be held in the Capitol Rotunda, where Ronald Reagan was sworn in back in 1985. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=8.08s)]
*  Temperatures on Monday are forecast to be in the low 20s, with wind gusts up to 30 miles [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=13.38s)]
*  an hour. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=17.04s)]
*  For more, let's head down to West Palm Beach, Florida, where CBS News political reporter [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=18.04s)]
*  Aaron Navarro is covering the president-elect. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=21.12s)]
*  Aaron, what do we know about his decision, and what else are we learning about Monday's [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=22.76s)]
*  plans? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=26.28s)]
*  Yeah, given the frigid temperatures below zero that are expected this Monday, President [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=28.28s)]
*  Trump announced that he would be giving his address in the Rotunda in the U.S. Capitol, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=34.4s)]
*  while also opening up the Capitol One Arena in Washington, D.C., in downtown to allow [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=39.24s)]
*  viewers and attendees to see a live stream of his remarks. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=45.96s)]
*  The parade that was planned to be held outside in the streets of Washington, D.C., he said, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=49.46s)]
*  will now be held in Capitol One Arena. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=54.52s)]
*  The question remains, though, given that there were about 200,000 people that bought [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=56.56s)]
*  tickets, Capitol One Arena has a capacity of just over 20,000 people. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  I'm seeing members of Congress say that they are reaching out to their constituents, saying [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=64.68s)]
*  that we're going to give you more information about what you can do as a ticket holder when [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=68.44s)]
*  we get it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=71.8s)]
*  So that's one question remaining. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=72.80000000000001s)]
*  And a statement from Secret Service says that they are working to adapt their own security [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=73.80000000000001s)]
*  plans for this upcoming Monday. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  Aaron, Trump's pick for Department of Homeland Security Secretary is on the Capitol Hill [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=79.76s)]
*  for her highly anticipated confirmation hearing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  During her testimony, Kristi Noem discussed the challenges she faces if confirmed for [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=88.68s)]
*  the position. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=92.0s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=93.0s)]
*  We must be vigilant and proactive and innovative to protect the homeland. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=94.0s)]
*  The challenges in front of us are extremely significant, and we must secure our borders [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=98.56s)]
*  against illegal trafficking and immigration. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=103.4s)]
*  We must safeguard our critical infrastructure to make sure that we're protected against [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=105.94s)]
*  cyber attacks, respond to natural disasters, and also terrorism. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  I firmly believe that we can meet those challenges head on with resolve. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=114.42s)]
*  Innovation, we can use collaboration with federal and with state partners. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=119.18s)]
*  And senators, I want your input. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=123.54s)]
*  Border security must remain a top priority. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=126.42s)]
*  What more are we learning about the incoming Trump administration's agenda from today's [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=128.66s)]
*  hearing and how is she being received? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=133.02s)]
*  Yeah, as Noem said, immigration is a top priority for her in her upcoming role. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=135.38s)]
*  She noted how deporting undocumented migrants who had committed violent crimes will be first [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=141.66s)]
*  on her list. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=147.94s)]
*  She said she would empower border patrol agents and that she will work with President-elect [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=148.94s)]
*  Trump when it comes to reinstating the remain in Mexico policy, a policy from his first [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=153.46s)]
*  term that said that those who applied for asylum had to wait in Mexico as their cases [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=158.9s)]
*  were heard. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=163.7s)]
*  She was also asked when it comes to relief for natural disasters and whether federal [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=164.7s)]
*  aid should be withheld. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=170.9s)]
*  She said referencing the LA fires while it is, quote, assigned that leadership has consequences. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=172.42000000000002s)]
*  She told Democratic senators there will be no political bias to how disaster relief is [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=178.70000000000002s)]
*  delivered. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=182.86s)]
*  And today, Judge Aline Cannon is hearing arguments over the Justice Department's plans to release [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=184.34s)]
*  the remainder of special counsel Jack Smith's report into Trump's alleged mishandling of [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=189.06s)]
*  classified documents. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=193.74s)]
*  We already saw the report on alleged election interference. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=194.74s)]
*  What are we expecting to come from that hearing? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=198.34s)]
*  Could the public see the final report? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=200.06s)]
*  Yeah, given this tight time, we know it's not expected the report will be released before [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=204.06s)]
*  President-elect Trump's inauguration. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=209.1s)]
*  Today's hearing will have Cannon hear out whether the Department of Justice can show [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=211.1s)]
*  that report to a select few in Congress as the case regarding Trump's co-defendants [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=216.14s)]
*  continues. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=222.62s)]
*  And Judge Cannon is also going to hear whether Trump can intervene in that case regarding [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=223.62s)]
*  his co-defendants. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=229.54s)]
*  So again, not expecting to see that report released publicly, at least before next Monday. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=230.54s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=234.5s)]
*  So let's talk about TikTok. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=235.5s)]
*  As I was mentioning with Catherine Cole, the Biden administration says that they're declining [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=236.5s)]
*  to enforce it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=240.22s)]
*  The press secretary said that given the sheer fact of timing, the administration recognizes [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=241.62s)]
*  that actions to implement the law must fall to the next administration. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=245.42s)]
*  What has Trump said about it? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=249.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, in a post, President-elect Trump said that the decision was expected and, quote, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=251.42s)]
*  everyone must respect it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=257.06s)]
*  He said his decision on what to do with TikTok will be made in the not too distant future. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=258.7s)]
*  He wants to review the ruling. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=263.14s)]
*  And we saw in the clip that you showed earlier, TikTok CEO say that they are grateful and [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=264.9s)]
*  pleased to have the support of a president who, quote, truly understands our platform. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=269.46s)]
*  TikTok CEO is expected to be in attendance at Trump's inauguration. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=273.9s)]
*  Trump has said before that he wants it to remain or become an American-owned company, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=278.34000000000003s)]
*  potentially working a deal with TikTok CEO. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=284.58s)]
*  Conversations such as that could happen in the next few days when they are together, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=288.18s)]
*  at least in the same room. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=291.94s)]
*  Erin Navarro, thank you. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfRSUJtIzBw&t=292.94s)]
