# NTSB holds briefing on D.C. plane crash investigation | Special Report
**CBS News:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM)
*  CBS News Special Report, I'm Lindsay Weiser at CBS News headquarters in New York. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=0.0s)]
*  The National Transportation Safety Board is giving an update on the air disaster last [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=3.64s)]
*  night near Washington. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=7.7s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  The National Transportation Safety Board is an independent federal agency that's charged [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  by Congress with investigating every civil aviation and serious accident and serious [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=14.66s)]
*  incident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=20.44s)]
*  I want to start by expressing our deepest condolences, our sympathies on behalf of the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=28.6s)]
*  entire board for those who lost loved ones in this terrible tragedy. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=36.300000000000004s)]
*  Our thoughts, our prayers are with you, entire communities were affected and we are thinking [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  of you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=51.16s)]
*  With me today is Bryce Banning. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=53.74s)]
*  Bryce is a senior aircraft accident investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=57.16s)]
*  He's also going to serve as our investigator in charge of this investigation. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=63.32s)]
*  Also with me today is the entire board. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=71.16s)]
*  We have Todd Inman, member Todd Inman. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=74.56s)]
*  Todd is going to serve as the board member on scene, the spokesperson for this investigation. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=77.72s)]
*  All of the board members will be here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=86.6s)]
*  We have Vice Chairman Alvin Brown, member Mike Graham who lived in Wichita for 20 years, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=89.53999999999999s)]
*  and we also have member Tom Chapman. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=97.6s)]
*  The NTSB's headquarters is just a mile from here. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=101.36s)]
*  And so we are all here because this is an all hands on deck event. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  And we're here to assure the American people that we are going to leave no stone unturned [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=113.6s)]
*  in this investigation. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=121.6s)]
*  We are going to conduct a thorough investigation of this entire tragedy, looking at the facts. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=123.56s)]
*  Now with that I want to level set. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=131.04s)]
*  When we go to the scene, and we were here last night, we allow the responders to do [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=134.82s)]
*  their important safety mission, which in this case was search and rescue and recovery. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=142.16s)]
*  We stand back to allow them to do their important safety mission. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  And so this for us is our first full day on scene with our entire crew coming together. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=154.06s)]
*  We have about nearly 50 people on scene. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=161.38s)]
*  In addition to our resources back at headquarters in our labs and throughout the agency. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=165.72s)]
*  So with that said, we are not going to get into specific facts in this press conference. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=173.14000000000001s)]
*  I want to level set here. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=181.78s)]
*  We're going to get into our investigative process. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=183.8s)]
*  As we are able to confirm factual information, we will provide that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=187.3s)]
*  I do want to say this is a whole of government effort. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=193.84s)]
*  I was able to brief along with others, the President of the United States and the Vice [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=200.34s)]
*  President this afternoon. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=205.54s)]
*  I want to thank them for their leadership, for their tremendous support of the NTSB, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=209.72s)]
*  for our investigators and for the responders that are on scene doing an important mission. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=217.32s)]
*  I also want to thank Secretary Sean Duffy, who I was communicating with early on after [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=222.98000000000002s)]
*  we first got word of this tragedy. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=230.24s)]
*  We've been working together throughout the day, along with his team at the DOT and within [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  FAA. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  I also want to thank Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was also integral in working with us today. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  Chris Rochello, the acting administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=248.28s)]
*  We've heard from many members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=253.56s)]
*  And so I will say this is a tremendous, one more time, whole of government effort. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=257.96s)]
*  I also want to take a moment and thank the many, many responders that have been on scene. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=264.48s)]
*  It has been an incredible effort. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=273.62s)]
*  And I will have a full list that I will provide, that we will provide tomorrow. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=276.92s)]
*  But I do want to thank them for all their work. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=283.62s)]
*  With that, I'm going to turn it over to member Inman for additional remarks. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=286.24s)]
*  So today is our first Friday on scene. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=300.36s)]
*  Our investigative team will be on scene as long as it takes in order to obtain all of [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=303.6s)]
*  the perishable evidence and all of the fact-finding that is needed to bring us to a conclusion [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=308.76000000000005s)]
*  of probable cause. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=314.36s)]
*  Our mission is to understand not just what happened, but why it happened. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=316.44s)]
*  And to recommend changes to prevent it from happening again. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=321.40000000000003s)]
*  Since we're just beginning our investigation, we don't have a great deal of information [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=325.8s)]
*  to share right now. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=329.6s)]
*  We will keep you informed by giving regular updates as we learn more. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=331.08s)]
*  Our intention is to have a preliminary report within 30 days. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=334.96s)]
*  And the final report will be issued once we've completed all of our fact-finding and investigation. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=339.4s)]
*  Now we will not be determining the probable cause of the accident while we are here on [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=347.68s)]
*  scene. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=351.2s)]
*  Nor will we speculate about what may have caused this accident. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=352.2s)]
*  Today we will be going and having an organizational meeting and establishing our parties to our [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=357.68s)]
*  investigation. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=362.72s)]
*  We currently have the following parties that are already identified. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=364.66s)]
*  PSA Airlines, GE Aerospace, Sikorsky, FAA, NACDA, which represents the air traffic controllers, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=369.12s)]
*  which represents the pilots, Army, AFA, which represents the flight attendants, the Transportation [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=381.40000000000003s)]
*  Safety Board of Canada will be an accredited representative under Annex 13 of a KO. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=388.48s)]
*  They will be supplemented by MHIRG as a technical advisor. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=395.36s)]
*  They were previously known as Bombardier. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=400.34000000000003s)]
*  The NTSB offers this party status to those companies, government agencies, and associations [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=405.16s)]
*  that have employees, activities, or equipment involved in the accident. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=410.90000000000003s)]
*  We offer that because they will provide technical expertise and relevant information supporting [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=416.3s)]
*  the development of the best possible factual record. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=420.84000000000003s)]
*  Once they join this investigation, they are not permitted to release documents or talk [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=424.76000000000005s)]
*  publicly about the investigation without the consent of the NTSB. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=429.91999999999996s)]
*  So I want to stress this. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=435.56s)]
*  It is only the NTSB that will provide information related to this investigation, with one exception, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=437.23999999999995s)]
*  regarding the fatalities that occurred. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=444.23999999999995s)]
*  That notification will be handled by the D.C. medical examiner. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=446.78s)]
*  We will not be discussing fatalities or names. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=450.34s)]
*  That will be handled by them as the proper authority. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=453.05999999999995s)]
*  So we want to talk a little bit about our process. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=457.34s)]
*  We will analyze the facts and determine the probable cause of the accident and then issue [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=460.84s)]
*  a report of those determinations. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=465.46s)]
*  I also want to talk a little bit about some additional people that are here with us and [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=467.78s)]
*  they're very important to us, and that is our family assistance group. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=471.94s)]
*  Later today we will be briefing the families. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=476.73999999999995s)]
*  We normally try to do this before a media event, but in this case they're still arriving. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=479.94s)]
*  Our family assistance specialists are already working closely with local officials and others [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=486.1s)]
*  to help assist them in their efforts to support everyone that's affected by this accident. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=490.24s)]
*  And let me just reiterate what the chair said. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=497.06s)]
*  A loss of life in an aviation accident is very unusual in the United States, and our [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=500.26s)]
*  heartfelt sorrow goes out to everyone that's affected. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=506.52s)]
*  It affects us, it affects everyone around us. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=509.1s)]
*  There are a lot of people hurting today. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=511.38s)]
*  We will help find out what happened. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=514.4s)]
*  We will do it factually and we will do it accurately. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=516.72s)]
*  As part of this, we are going to be standing up some specific working groups. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=521.76s)]
*  Those working groups will be operations that will be looking at the history of the accident [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=526.5s)]
*  flight and crew members' duties for as many days before the crash as appears relevant. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=531.38s)]
*  We will be forming a structures group, which will be the documentation of the airframe [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=537.16s)]
*  wreckage and the accident scene, including calculation of impact angles to help determine [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=542.32s)]
*  the plane's pre-impact course and altitude. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=547.9200000000001s)]
*  We'll have a power plants group. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=552.0400000000001s)]
*  They will do the examination of the engines and the engine accessories. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=554.24s)]
*  We'll have a systems group. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=558.6400000000001s)]
*  They will study the components of the plane's hydraulic, electrical, pneumatic, and associated [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=560.88s)]
*  systems together with the instruments and elements of the flight control system. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=565.24s)]
*  We'll have an air traffic control group. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=571.2s)]
*  They will do reconstruction and review of air traffic control systems provided to and [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=573.5600000000001s)]
*  including acquisition of pertinent flight track surveillance information, what you might [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=578.36s)]
*  typically think of as radar or ADS-B, along with controller pilot communications. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=582.88s)]
*  We will also have a survival factors group. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=589.98s)]
*  They will be doing the documentation of impact, forces and injuries, community emergency [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=592.5s)]
*  and all crash and fire rescue efforts. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=598.04s)]
*  Also due to the unique nature of this crash, we will be having a helicopter group as well. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=602.4399999999999s)]
*  Lastly, we will have a human performance group and this will not be its own group. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=609.4399999999999s)]
*  It will actually be a part of the operations, air traffic control, and helicopter groups. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=614.88s)]
*  They will study the crew performance and all before the accident factors that might be [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=621.64s)]
*  involved in human error, including fatigue, medication, medical histories, training, workload, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=626.48s)]
*  equipment design, and work environment. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=632.92s)]
*  Now we're going to take a few questions, but I will again stress we don't have a lot of [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=637.16s)]
*  information now. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=642.3199999999999s)]
*  We will continue to gather that. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=643.6s)]
*  We will try to release it as we can, but we will only talk about the facts of the case [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=646.12s)]
*  that we know right now. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=650.28s)]
*  I'm going to ask, we'll call on a few people, I'm going to ask that you state your name, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=653.68s)]
*  affiliation. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=656.7199999999999s)]
*  James Matthews from the State Youth. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=657.7199999999999s)]
*  So we've heard from President Trump today talking about DEI hiring policies within the [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=660.16s)]
*  FAA and associating that with the cause of this accident. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=666.68s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=671.68s)]
*  Well unfortunately I didn't hear the remarks. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=674.12s)]
*  I was briefing House and Senate members, but I believe Chair would you like to take them? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=675.9599999999999s)]
*  As part of any investigation, we look at the human, the machine, and the environment. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=680.36s)]
*  So we will look at all the humans that were involved in this accident. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=686.76s)]
*  Again we will look at the aircraft, we will look at the helicopter, we will look at the [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=692.32s)]
*  environment in which they were operating in. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=696.12s)]
*  That is part of, that is standard in any part of our investigation. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=698.44s)]
*  I'll turn it back. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=702.44s)]
*  Chair, can I ask you, has the flight data recorder been recovered yet, and what is the [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=703.44s)]
*  difficulty in a water disaster like this which presents a very difficult environment for [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=708.88s)]
*  your investigators and the people out on the water right now? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=714.5999999999999s)]
*  The question was on the flight data recorders. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=717.8s)]
*  We have not recovered the flight data recorders yet. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=722.52s)]
*  We know they're there. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=725.4s)]
*  They are underwater. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=727.3599999999999s)]
*  This is not unusual for the NTSB. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=729.04s)]
*  We have many times recovered flight data recorders in water. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=732.1999999999999s)]
*  We have our lab right here that is about a mile from the NTSB, so it's not unusual. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=737.28s)]
*  Once we get those, we'll be able to get those read and information from them to be [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=743.88s)]
*  able to provide further information to you. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=750.64s)]
*  I'm going to turn it back over to Member Inland. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=755.36s)]
*  Hey there, Skyler Henry with CBS News. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=758.52s)]
*  Earlier today, Defense Secretary Pete Hexs said a mistake was made last night. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=761.84s)]
*  What's off of you all's initial investigations and preliminary findings? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=766.64s)]
*  Have you all been able to tell whether this was human error or mechanical failure? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=770.5600000000001s)]
*  The question was, has there been human error or mechanical failure? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=774.52s)]
*  We don't know what we know just yet. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=777.8000000000001s)]
*  We do not know enough facts to be able to rule in or out human factor, mechanical factors. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=779.72s)]
*  That is part of the NTSB investigative process, and where all of these groups will come together. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=786.0400000000001s)]
*  It's one of the reasons why the NTSB is known as the gold standard. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=791.12s)]
*  We will take the time that's necessary, but I'd also like to reiterate, if we find something [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=794.72s)]
*  that is a significant issue that warrants immediate action, we will not hesitate to [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=799.96s)]
*  make those recommendations and make them public. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=804.76s)]
*  We have a good track record on that and we want to continue doing so. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=806.72s)]
*  Sir? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=810.28s)]
*  Hello, Sir Tom Costello with NBC News. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=811.28s)]
*  Does it hurt your investigative process, maybe for the chairman, does it hurt your investigative [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=814.3199999999999s)]
*  process to have the president already suggesting possible causes here as you try to keep an [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=818.6s)]
*  open mind and begin this investigation? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=824.4s)]
*  Thank you, Sir. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=827.0799999999999s)]
*  Tom, with all due respect, I think the press also likes to state what probable cause is [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=830.68s)]
*  before we get to the probable cause. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=836.52s)]
*  So what I'm going to say is you need to give us time. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=838.92s)]
*  You need to give NTSB, it's not that we don't have information. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=842.28s)]
*  We do have information. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=845.9599999999999s)]
*  We have data. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=847.64s)]
*  We have substantial amounts of information. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=848.64s)]
*  We need to verify information. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=851.24s)]
*  We need to take our time to make sure it is accurate. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=854.48s)]
*  That's best for you. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=858.84s)]
*  That's important for the families. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=860.52s)]
*  It's important for legislators who are seeking answers to try to figure out what they're [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=863.0s)]
*  going to do about this. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=867.0s)]
*  And so it will take time. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=868.8s)]
*  We do have a lot of information, but we need some time to verify that. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=870.04s)]
*  Yeah, Member Chase Williams with Fox Business. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=875.36s)]
*  I'm wondering about the conditions in the tower last night. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=881.04s)]
*  Were there any performance issues in the past with any of these controllers? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=883.8s)]
*  Anything of that nature? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=888.08s)]
*  The question is about controllers. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=889.08s)]
*  As I said, we are just now forming the groups. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=891.6s)]
*  The controllers do have union representation, which they are entitled to. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=894.32s)]
*  They'll be working with our party system and our party groups. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=897.28s)]
*  They'll be conducting interviews. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=900.04s)]
*  Those interviews will need to be analyzed, transcribed, and other team members will need [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=902.28s)]
*  to look over it. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=905.6s)]
*  It will be a long process, but we will go through the entire history. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=906.76s)]
*  Michelle Rowe, The Independent. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=912.44s)]
*  My question is for the Chairwoman. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=914.44s)]
*  Can you tell us more about what the President and the Vice President's responses were when [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=916.44s)]
*  you briefed them this afternoon? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=919.64s)]
*  Sure. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=923.08s)]
*  So the question was about my briefing for the President and the Vice President. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=925.08s)]
*  As is standard, we offer briefings on our process and what we know. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=930.76s)]
*  This was a briefing with the President and Vice President and with Secretary Duffy and [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=936.12s)]
*  Secretary Hegseth and also the Acting Administrator of the FAA. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=941.8s)]
*  There was discussion on what we know so far and our process. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=947.88s)]
*  And that was about it. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=955.32s)]
*  Madam Chairwoman, Stephanie Ramos with ABC News. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=957.32s)]
*  Similar to Tom Costello's question, the President has stated what may have caused the crash [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=961.32s)]
*  stating common sense. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=966.6s)]
*  Does that affect your progress at this early stage? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=968.6s)]
*  So the NTSB, we conduct an important safety mission where we take a very careful approach. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=972.6s)]
*  I'm sorry, the question was on speculating during investigations, which is, we often [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=982.6s)]
*  hear about. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=993.64s)]
*  What I will say is we look at facts on our investigation and that will take some time. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=995.3199999999999s)]
*  And at some point we'll be able to provide that factual information, as Member Immen [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1001.8s)]
*  said, and provide that hopefully tomorrow. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1006.76s)]
*  Madam Chairwoman, have you been able to retrieve the black boxes from the helicopter as the [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1010.4399999999999s)]
*  military decided whether they're going to read those or the NTSB? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1020.04s)]
*  And what about the ATC tapes? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1024.04s)]
*  Have you guys been able to? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1025.6399999999999s)]
*  So the question was about black boxes, which are referred to as black boxes, which are [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1026.52s)]
*  typically orange. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1030.68s)]
*  We have not recovered any of the boxes involved yet. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1032.44s)]
*  We feel comfortable and confident that we will be able to right now. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1035.8799999999999s)]
*  Recovery of life is probably most important in those that were involved. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1039.72s)]
*  I mean, there are still ongoing recovery efforts involving the fatalities involved, along with [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1045.16s)]
*  some debris is coming out as well. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1051.8s)]
*  We will make sure that that perishable evidence is maintained. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1054.2s)]
*  We have a great process for that. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1058.44s)]
*  We will probably have more than one black box, so to speak. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1060.68s)]
*  It's our understanding that the Sikorsky helicopter is equipped with some form of recording [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1065.8799999999999s)]
*  devices, and those will be read either by the DOD or by us. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1071.08s)]
*  We have a good starting relationship with them, and we've already made agreements in [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1075.3999999999999s)]
*  order to be able to do that. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1079.0s)]
*  So I feel comfortable in what we're going to be doing. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1080.9199999999998s)]
*  The other question was about air traffic control. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1083.32s)]
*  We received a very large package of information from the FAA at about 3 a.m., I believe, this [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1085.96s)]
*  morning. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1091.3999999999999s)]
*  That is still being reviewed and analyzed. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1092.52s)]
*  I would say there's a lot more information that usually comes in that than what you might [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1095.08s)]
*  find online and people might speculate about. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1098.36s)]
*  And that is part of that overall process where we take the time to get the information correct [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1101.6399999999999s)]
*  and to make sure all the parties are engaged, involved, and can fact check that information. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1107.24s)]
*  Gabe Cohen from CNN. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1114.12s)]
*  Can you tell me if the NTSB has reviewed this FAA internal report that has been cited by [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1115.56s)]
*  the New York Times indicating that the controller that was on duty at the time of the crash [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1121.3999999999999s)]
*  was doing a job that's usually done by two people? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1126.36s)]
*  We have not reviewed any specific reports about the controllers at this time, at least [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1130.84s)]
*  from the leadership team. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1135.3999999999999s)]
*  Our investigators are continuing to pull all that information. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1137.1599999999999s)]
*  Their personnel records, their files, where they were at, whether they were fatigued, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1140.04s)]
*  all that information will be part of that investigative process. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1144.84s)]
*  But right now we can't speculate on anything that may have been reported in the media [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1147.8799999999999s)]
*  until we get the opportunity to validate and understand how it impacts the investigation. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1151.56s)]
*  We're going to take just a few more questions. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1156.04s)]
*  Let's follow up on that. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1157.72s)]
*  Sir? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1159.08s)]
*  Yes, Oren Conhaime, G4 Magazine. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1159.96s)]
*  What's the process and logistics like of bringing the families in? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1162.9199999999998s)]
*  Are they coming into the airport? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1166.2s)]
*  And how are you going to sort of treat the sensitivity of bringing them to the place [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1168.44s)]
*  where this tragedy happened? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1173.8799999999999s)]
*  So the question is about the families. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1175.96s)]
*  And many of those families are still en route. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1179.08s)]
*  Some are still being notified from both the military and from the commercial crash. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1181.96s)]
*  There is a family assistance facility that's being stood up by American and PSA airlines [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1188.04s)]
*  in Bethesda, Maryland. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1195.0s)]
*  They've already been working on that, standing it up. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1196.04s)]
*  Our team from our disaster assistance team has also been coordinating with them. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1198.44s)]
*  We plan on briefing them. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1203.96s)]
*  It is customary that at some point, if the families wish to go to part of the accident site, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1205.64s)]
*  that we would arrange such a thing. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1211.4s)]
*  But it will only be when we know that it's safe, we have the correct perishable evidence, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1213.0800000000002s)]
*  and we can do it in the proper modesty that should be for those family members. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1218.1200000000001s)]
*  It will be a little bit of a process, but it will take some time. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1222.44s)]
*  Is there enough follow up on the air traffic control? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1224.8400000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1227.4s)]
*  Sir? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1228.6000000000001s)]
*  Or you? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1229.1000000000001s)]
*  I know that we have Mariel Carbone with DC News now. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1230.2s)]
*  We've heard from some witnesses that they saw people were able to come down the slides [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1232.68s)]
*  of the plane. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1237.16s)]
*  Has there been any indication that people made it off the plane into the water? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1237.72s)]
*  Well, again, we will not speak to the fatalities. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1242.1200000000001s)]
*  The DC medical examiner will. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1244.44s)]
*  But I think the DC fire chief this morning very succinctly said [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1245.96s)]
*  correctly that we believe there are no survivors. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1250.76s)]
*  What's the rate of the planes like today even get out of the plane? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1252.76s)]
*  Last question? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1257.3200000000002s)]
*  Sir, before you get to the— [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1259.24s)]
*  Hang on one second. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1259.64s)]
*  Right now, we're going through the debris fields. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1261.5600000000002s)]
*  Nothing we've seen would indicate that maybe slides or shoots were deployed. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1263.8000000000002s)]
*  It was a very quick, rapid impact. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1268.68s)]
*  But we've seen nothing in that regard so far from the evidence we had, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1271.16s)]
*  but we still need to verify all of that information. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1274.76s)]
*  One more question? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1277.48s)]
*  Jeff Cook, ABC News. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1280.68s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1283.48s)]
*  Jeff Cook, ABC News. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1284.28s)]
*  What do you know about the altitude of the helicopter at the moment of impact? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1285.48s)]
*  And can you talk about the procedure for such helicopters in that area? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1288.44s)]
*  The question was about the helicopter procedures. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1292.52s)]
*  And in DC, it's kind of a unique environment. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1294.6000000000001s)]
*  We've been getting briefed more and more by the FAA. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1297.32s)]
*  I'm not an air traffic control specialist, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1299.6399999999999s)]
*  but there are actually helicopter zones, if you will, or tracks. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1301.96s)]
*  And this one was transiting, I believe, from track one to four [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1305.48s)]
*  as part of their normal procedure. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1310.52s)]
*  If you live in DC, you see a lot of helicopters going down into this area. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1311.96s)]
*  So there's a very well-defined system in that regard. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1315.72s)]
*  As far as altitude, until we get the additional information, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1319.1599999999999s)]
*  we can't validate or basically corroborate any of that [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1322.52s)]
*  until we get more of the electronic data and the data that's on the plane. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1326.2s)]
*  I do want to clarify one question that also came about cell phones. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1329.88s)]
*  You know, in today's age and time, a lot of electronics and other devices [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1334.2s)]
*  do contain a lot of different information. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1337.56s)]
*  We've found on a number of our accidents [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1339.8s)]
*  that we actually are notified through a smartphone that made sense that. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1342.28s)]
*  As part of our process, we will obviously treat the [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1346.52s)]
*  all of the effects of the deceased with dignity. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1349.8s)]
*  We are already starting to pull that information together. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1354.76s)]
*  If we feel that it's necessary to find or pull some of that information, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1357.24s)]
*  we will work with the families and make sure we do it in a [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1361.0s)]
*  manner that's respectful for them and their privacy. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1364.8400000000001s)]
*  But right now, we don't have any plans specifically on that amount, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1367.4s)]
*  on that area until we need to. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1371.16s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1372.76s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1373.4s)]
*  That was a briefing from the National Transportation Safety Board, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1379.16s)]
*  including from Chair Jennifer Homendy, who said this is an all hands on deck event [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1382.92s)]
*  that they will leave no stone unturned and will conduct a thorough investigation [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1387.5600000000002s)]
*  after last night's collision between a regional American Airlines plane, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1392.3600000000001s)]
*  which was carrying 64 people on board and a Blackhawk military helicopter, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1396.28s)]
*  which was carrying three soldiers. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1401.0800000000002s)]
*  No survivors are believed to have been found. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1403.64s)]
*  This is now a recovery mission. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1406.52s)]
*  NTSB Chair Homendy said that today is their first full day on the scene. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1408.44s)]
*  They have nearly 50 people there. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1412.6s)]
*  She said they wouldn't get into specific facts, only talk about their process. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1414.6s)]
*  We did hear from an NTSB member, Tom Inman, who is serving as a spokesperson for this and said [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1418.28s)]
*  they will be determining probable cause, not just what happened, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1424.1999999999998s)]
*  but why and also recommend changes. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1427.3999999999999s)]
*  He said they will have a preliminary report in 30 days, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1429.56s)]
*  did not give a date for a final report, but said that they will be looking at everything, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1432.6s)]
*  including looking at the helicopter, looking at air traffic control, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1437.08s)]
*  looking at the pilots on the plane, whether air traffic controllers were fatigued. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1441.8s)]
*  Now, he was asked to question any indication of whether people made it off of the plane, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1445.8799999999999s)]
*  and he said, quoting the DC Fire Chief, saying that he said, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1450.2s)]
*  correctly, we believe there are no survivors and saying nothing they have seen in the debris [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1454.28s)]
*  field would suggest any slides or shoots were deployed, saying it was a rapid dissension [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1457.8799999999999s)]
*  into water. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1463.0s)]
*  We're joined now by Laura Ein Settler, a commercial airline pilot with more than [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1464.36s)]
*  30 years of flying experience. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1468.6s)]
*  Thank you for joining us on such a tragic day. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1470.92s)]
*  What stands out to you right now based on what we know about this collision? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1474.2s)]
*  Well, as we just heard from the NTSB, there's so many different factors involved that they're [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1479.0800000000002s)]
*  going to be looking at. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1483.64s)]
*  I can only really speak to pilots' perspectives on this. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1485.5600000000002s)]
*  Our number one most critical priority is keeping everyone safe at all times. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1490.2s)]
*  And with aviation, we dissect everything with a fine tooth comb so that we can make [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1496.2s)]
*  changes going forward to help best protect everyone involved. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1501.24s)]
*  I do want to ask you about something that we heard from Senator Tammy Duckworth, and that is [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1507.64s)]
*  that air traffic control spoke, contacted and spoke with the helicopter crew twice. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1512.5200000000002s)]
*  They acknowledged the instructions twice that this specific area is a special flight restricted [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1517.16s)]
*  area and you have to fly there with additional training. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1523.4s)]
*  There's also the question of whether they were using night vision goggles, but that every [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1526.2800000000002s)]
*  member on board that Black Hawk helicopter will have been tasked with also looking around and [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1530.6000000000001s)]
*  making sure there were no obstructions or anything. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1535.96s)]
*  Anything from what I just said that stands out to you and what you've been thinking about? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1539.0800000000002s)]
*  So we have to look and see, again, the NTSB will determine this as far as accurate [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1545.4s)]
*  timing and space, where everyone was positioned at. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1552.44s)]
*  But when you see the flight tracks and you hear some of the data recordings, yes, the Black Hawk [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1555.88s)]
*  second pilot had clicked on and said that, yes, they affirmatively had the regional jet in sight. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1563.96s)]
*  So that's something that they're going to look at. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1571.96s)]
*  Was it obviously a definitive thinking that they had it in sight and could have been [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1574.92s)]
*  misconstrued as something else? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1580.92s)]
*  Those are the things that as pilots, we're always looking around, making sure that everything in [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1583.96s)]
*  our environment, what we're doing, how we're operating is safe. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1590.76s)]
*  So everyone in aviation, you always work toward making everything as best and safe as possible. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1593.72s)]
*  We learn from these things and we make those changes. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1600.1200000000001s)]
*  Captain Einsetler, thank you so much. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1603.24s)]
*  Let's go to Skylar Henry at Reagan National Airport. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1605.0s)]
*  Skylar, you were just at that press conference and you asked a specific [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1607.3200000000002s)]
*  question quoting something that Defense Secretary Hegseth said today, that a mistake was made. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1610.52s)]
*  Take us through your question and the response, please. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1615.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, well, we asked member J. Todd in-men about exactly what those mistakes could have been that [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1619.24s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was referring to earlier today. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1625.64s)]
*  I asked whether that was a human error or whether there was some sort of mechanical [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1629.3200000000002s)]
*  failure. But what we have heard from the NTSB time and again over the course of this press [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1633.3200000000002s)]
*  conference was that they are going to be meticulous and make sure that they move through [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1637.72s)]
*  this investigation thoroughly and slowly and before they release any of their findings, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1642.6000000000001s)]
*  which they say will be released within the next 30 days. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1647.0s)]
*  Now, as for how they are going about this investigation, a series of steps, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1651.08s)]
*  including probable cause, they also say that they will be performing a series of groups [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1655.32s)]
*  to try to reconstruct this scene and reconstruct this accident altogether. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1661.16s)]
*  They say that they will be working with groups, looking to create structure groups, to talk about [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1665.64s)]
*  impact angles and also talk about pre-impact coursing and also the altitude of not only that [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1671.3200000000002s)]
*  commercial regional jet but also of that Black Hawk helicopter. They also say that there will be a [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1677.24s)]
*  systems group where they will go to and look at the air traffic control systems and review that, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1683.0800000000002s)]
*  the radar, so to speak. And they say that they will look at also the human performance group [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1689.48s)]
*  that will talk about how everyone was doing, whether that is the pilots themselves, air traffic [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1694.36s)]
*  control to ensure that this is an investigation that is as thorough as possible. But one thing [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1698.84s)]
*  that I should point out, Lindsay, is that the NTSB has still said that they are still bringing family [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1703.0s)]
*  members here to the airport. They have not yet been in contact with everyone who could be next of [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1708.6799999999998s)]
*  kin for those who may be on board or may have been on board either of those aircrafts. And so they say [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1714.6s)]
*  that they are still working to try to get into contact with them. We know that there are some [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1719.4799999999998s)]
*  certain high-profile names that are part of it. We also know that there is an international [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1723.88s)]
*  component as well. So we will see what happens as these families get the news here later on today. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1728.3600000000001s)]
*  Mr. Eamon also saying they have not yet recovered the flight data recorders or the helicopter [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1732.7600000000002s)]
*  black boxes, that this is still an active recovery mission. Skyler Henry, thank you. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1737.4s)]
*  Let's go now to senior national security correspondent Charlie Daggadah. Charlie, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1741.88s)]
*  you have more on the helicopter involved in this collision. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1745.4s)]
*  I do, yes. This is a background briefing from an army representative. Pardon me, I read my notes. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1748.8400000000001s)]
*  This is a very experienced crew. It's been described as. They would have been familiar [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1753.72s)]
*  with that route. I'll get to that in a minute. One pilot had 1,000 flying hours. The other had 500. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1758.84s)]
*  He described it as a relatively easy corridor. The maximum ceiling over the river at that part [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1764.92s)]
*  of the river is 200 feet. Didn't want to speculate at what altitude or height the [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1771.08s)]
*  helicopter was flying. There was some question about night goggles and night vision that came [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1777.8s)]
*  up as well. And there are two arguments about that. One, they can help in a low light situation, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1783.08s)]
*  but they can also hinder because it robs you of your broad perspective looking out and seeing [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1789.56s)]
*  what's happening. So I spoke with a former Black Hawk pilot a few moments ago who ran those very [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1796.36s)]
*  routes. He was part of that battalion and said, this is very common. It's part of their training. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1803.8799999999999s)]
*  It's part of what they do because a lot of question marks have been, why are helicopters [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1810.44s)]
*  flying so close to Reagan National Airport at that sort of level elevation or altitude? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1814.76s)]
*  But this is what they train to do. They train to move individuals from point A to point B, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1822.04s)]
*  oftentimes along the Potomac. And they are also trained to do that if they should need to do that [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1827.16s)]
*  in an emergency. Because if you haven't been to the D.C. area, it was an eye opener for me, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1833.0s)]
*  they're up and down the Potomac all the time and right around Reagan National Airport. So that is [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1838.92s)]
*  not unique. That's a relatively common thing, as it's been described as routine. And they would [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1843.48s)]
*  have known that route. So really, you know, you hit the nail on the head. It's not just what happened. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1848.44s)]
*  That's pretty clear. It's why. Charlie, I have to be quick with you, but you mentioned the maximum [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1853.24s)]
*  ceiling over the river is 200 feet. What does that mean? Yeah, so that's as high as helicopters [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1857.72s)]
*  are supposed to go within that window because the river is broken down into a couple of sections [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1863.0s)]
*  when it comes to where the helicopters are flying. And as it was described from that, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1867.72s)]
*  are you representative that is as high that's the top of the ceiling. They can go 200 feet. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1870.92s)]
*  OK, Charlie Daggett, thank you. Tom Hansen is at the Ashburn Ice House where he's been speaking [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1876.04s)]
*  to the very tight knit community there. Tom, please explain to us why you're there, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1881.0s)]
*  what we know about some of the victims and what you're hearing. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1885.24s)]
*  Yeah, Lindsey, well, it's an incredibly somber scene here today. As we got here, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1889.16s)]
*  we have seen a steady flow of people going in and out of this skating club. As we know, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1893.56s)]
*  many of the people who are on this plane were elite ice skaters, figure skaters. And so what [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1900.2s)]
*  we've seen are people bringing flowers, other forms of condolences to really honor the people [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1905.8s)]
*  who have or who are believed to have passed away a growing memorial on the inside of this skating [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1912.28s)]
*  rink. The people that we've spoken to relatively young, I should point out, one 14 year old says [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1918.44s)]
*  that she believes that she has lost several of her best friends. Another ice skater as young as [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1924.6000000000001s)]
*  10 years old saying that they believe they know people who were on this plane. We're talking about [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1930.92s)]
*  competitors. We're talking about parents. We're talking about potentially coaches being on this [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1937.48s)]
*  flight. One other mom and daughter that we spoke to said that they were on a flight just minutes [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1943.08s)]
*  before this plane landed. They had landed from a similar path to Wichita, from Wichita to DC. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1949.8s)]
*  So also experiencing some disbelief and survivor's guilt, this community absolutely reeling from this [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1956.76s)]
*  devastating loss. Lindsey. Tom Hanson, thank you so much. Our coverage on this national tragedy, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1963.56s)]
*  the crash involving a regional American Airlines flight and a military Blackhawk helicopter taking [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1969.0s)]
*  place last night near Reagan National Airport. Our coverage will continue on CBS News 24 seven, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1974.28s)]
*  your local news and tonight on the CBS evening news. This has been a CBS News special report. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1980.36s)]
*  I'm Lindsey Riser. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpYrENhLhdM&t=1985.08s)]
