# What will Trump, Netanyahu discuss at the White House?
**CBS News:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA)
*  Switching gears though, all eyes on the White House today as President Trump gears up to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=0.0s)]
*  host his first meeting with an international leader in Washington. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=4.64s)]
*  In just a few hours, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will sit down with Trump [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  to discuss the second phase of the hostage negotiations with Hamas. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=13.4s)]
*  CBS News Senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang joins us now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=18.04s)]
*  For more on all this, Weijia, great to see you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=21.66s)]
*  What details are we learning about this meeting happening later on today? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=24.02s)]
*  Well, Liz, you already mentioned what the top line is probably going to be, and that is how [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=28.56s)]
*  and if Israel will in fact move into that second phase of the ceasefire agreement and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=33.4s)]
*  hostage release agreement that, of course, the Biden administration brokered, but the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=39.6s)]
*  Trump administration is tasked with implementing. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  And that is a big question, Liz, because there are a lot of different calculations that Netanyahu [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=48.5s)]
*  has to take into effect, including his own political preservation when it comes to exactly [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=53.24s)]
*  how to completely unwind. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=59.64s)]
*  But of course, Trump has taken full ownership of this agreement. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=62.14s)]
*  He said that it was because of him that it finished the that it crossed over to the finish [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=66.08s)]
*  line. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=71.84s)]
*  And so they want all of the hostages to be released. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=72.84s)]
*  They want the deal to be successful. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=75.68s)]
*  And there might be some tension there. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=78.84s)]
*  We also expect these two leaders. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=80.12s)]
*  We'll talk about how to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions as well as how to normalize relations [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=82.2s)]
*  with Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=89.48s)]
*  But, Liz, I think what's really important here is just the fact that Trump has chosen [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=90.48s)]
*  to host Prime Minister Netanyahu in Israel as his first meeting with any world leader, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=95.36s)]
*  because that really is meant to set a tone for a focus on his foreign policy. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  Of course, Biden chose Japan. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=105.56s)]
*  And then we saw four years of several different actions to really strengthen ties with allies [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=108.22s)]
*  in that region to combat China. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=115.44s)]
*  So this is much more than just any meeting. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=117.42s)]
*  It's not just about the U.S. and Israel. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=119.94s)]
*  It's about Trump's priorities as it relates to the international stage. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=122.42s)]
*  And ahead of this meeting with Netanyahu, Weijia, President Trump will sign several [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=127.48s)]
*  executive orders about the U.S.' involvement in the Middle East. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=130.82s)]
*  What more do we know about those orders and how is this going to impact his conversation [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=135.08s)]
*  with Netanyahu? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=139.02s)]
*  The main order that we have been reporting out this morning is against Iran. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=142.14000000000001s)]
*  Again, it's all about Iran's ambitions to create a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=147.44s)]
*  And the Trump administration says they are going to put a maximum pressure campaign on [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=152.18s)]
*  Iran to make sure they block any pathway to any such weapon. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=158.98000000000002s)]
*  And so they are going to be enforcing strong sanctions on oil exports from Iran, really [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=164.08s)]
*  trying to hit their purse strings. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=170.76s)]
*  And this certainly will be a big conversation between Netanyahu and Trump because there [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=172.88s)]
*  are other conversations happening in Israel about whether that is enough and whether there [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=178.28s)]
*  ought to be more, perhaps a preemptive strike against Iran. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=185.04s)]
*  And so the two leaders will have to discuss that as it relates to all of the countries [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=189.12s)]
*  in that region and certainly national security here at home too. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=194.66s)]
*  And Weijia, I want to make sure we talk about tariffs. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=198.94s)]
*  China imposed retaliatory tariffs after Trump's tariffs went into effect last night. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=201.1s)]
*  Can you walk us through the back and forth between these two leaders? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=206.02s)]
*  So this is nothing new. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=210.86s)]
*  Trump has actually used tariffs on China before during the first administration. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=212.42000000000002s)]
*  What is new is sort of where these tariffs will be impacted and the retaliation that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=217.72s)]
*  we've seen so far from China, which obviously does not want a trade war right now considering [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=222.76000000000002s)]
*  its own economy is in a vulnerable state. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=228.52s)]
*  So you're right in that the tariffs against Chinese imports went into effect at midnight [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=230.8s)]
*  and China has already responded with responsive tariffs. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=236.52s)]
*  So that's going to be a 15 percent tax on certain types of coal and liquefied natural [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=240.96s)]
*  gas, a 10 percent tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large displacement cars and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=245.88s)]
*  pickup trucks and a few other sectors as well. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=253.92s)]
*  And so this, the Trump administration says, is in order to put pressure on Beijing to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  do more to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=263.08s)]
*  And of course, we should note that in the previous administration, Biden and Xi Jinping [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=268.4s)]
*  did sign an agreement in November of 2023 to try to do just that by limiting the amount [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=274.12s)]
*  of ingredients for fentanyl that China can export to other countries. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=280.36s)]
*  But we should also note that there has not been a substantial decrease in the amount [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=284.76s)]
*  of fentanyl seizures since that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=289.16s)]
*  And so that is why Trump is saying they clearly have not done enough and need to do more to [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=292.0s)]
*  stop this deadly drug from coming in. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=296.32s)]
*  We'll see how and if China responds. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=297.96s)]
*  As far as more tariffs, at this point, we haven't heard about another step from the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=302.0s)]
*  U.S.'s part to respond to the retaliatory tariffs. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=307.24s)]
*  But again, that's always an option for Trump, considering the percentage on Chinese tariffs [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  was 10 percent on Mexico and Canada. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=317.04s)]
*  It was going to be 25 percent. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=319.56s)]
*  So that's just an example of sort of the wiggle room that administration might have to raise [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=321.48s)]
*  the percentage even more. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=325.92s)]
*  We just moments ago, Secretary of State Marco Rubio addressed reporters during his visit [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=328.04s)]
*  to Costa Rica. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=333.04s)]
*  And he commented on El Salvador's offer to accept and imprison U.S. criminals. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=334.68s)]
*  We want to play back that sound and then talk on the other side. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  That's an offer President Bukele made. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=344.16s)]
*  Obviously, we'll have to study it on our end. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  There are obviously legalities involved. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  We have a constitution. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=350.56s)]
*  We have all sorts of things. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=351.64000000000004s)]
*  But it's a very generous offer. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=352.64000000000004s)]
*  No one's ever made an offer like that. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=354.12s)]
*  And to outsource at a fraction of the cost at least some of the most dangerous and violent [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=356.32s)]
*  criminals that we have in the United States. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=362.28000000000003s)]
*  But obviously, the administration will have to make a decision. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=364.28000000000003s)]
*  But I raised it yesterday because it's an incredible offer and an unprecedented one. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=366.72s)]
*  Weijia, can you walk us through what this offer was to take in U.S. prisoners and have [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=371.36s)]
*  them actually imprisoned in El Salvador? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=377.2s)]
*  What does that country get out of this? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=380.8s)]
*  What is this arrangement? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=382.2s)]
*  That's just part of the offer because what really matters here is what the U.S. wanted [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=385.12s)]
*  El Salvador to do, which is to take illegal, undocumented immigrants that are here in the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=391.04s)]
*  U.S. as the president continues to carry out what he calls the biggest mass deportation [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=397.16s)]
*  in American history. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=405.6s)]
*  The problem with that is that these people have to go somewhere. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=406.76s)]
*  And there are several countries who have already said they are not willing to take the people [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=410.72s)]
*  who are currently detained in the U.S., especially if they are known gang members or criminals. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=415.52s)]
*  And so El Salvador has agreed to be a third party, a third country to take in some of [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=421.12s)]
*  those criminals while also offering to take in Americans. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=427.64s)]
*  Now, Rubio is America's top diplomat, which is why his answer was so diplomatic. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  He reiterated that it was a kind offer, but this is not about American criminals at all. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=436.68s)]
*  This is not about finding a place for American citizens to go. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=442.68s)]
*  So even though he had to address it and use that sort of flowery language to talk about [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=448.28s)]
*  what a generous offer it is, he also mentioned the kind of legal and constitutional challenges [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=453.32s)]
*  that would arise if that were even pursued. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=458.56s)]
*  And so I don't think that it's something that the U.S. is going to seriously consider, Liz. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=462.24s)]
*  All right, Weijia Jiang, thanks so much for putting that into context. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soP56EuhyIA&t=466.64s)]
