# Helicopter crew in midair crash was training in case of capital attack
**CBS News:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0)
*  talking about that mid-air collision in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=0.0s)]
*  You see this map here underneath my feet on the ground. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=3.04s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News senior national security correspondent Charlie Daggett. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=6.4s)]
*  Charlie, you broke some news about the helicopter crew, what it was actually training for as I look [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=10.16s)]
*  at this route here underneath my feet. I'm really wanting to know why they were in the sky. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=15.6s)]
*  I wish I could see that route. I want to see what you're referring to. However, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=23.2s)]
*  what got our attention was when Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, during a very brief part of that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=26.96s)]
*  briefing with the president, he mentioned something called the continuity of government mission. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=34.32s)]
*  Okay, so we dug a little bit deeper into exactly what he was referring to. So the Black Hawk [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=39.6s)]
*  helicopter crews that were doing that, essentially it was an annual assessment. I know it's been [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=44.56s)]
*  called a training exercise. In theory, yes, but it's to refresh what they've already learned. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=50.88s)]
*  So this wasn't just, these aren't newcomers. One of the crew had 1,000 hours flight time, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=60.56s)]
*  another one had 500. Now if you consider inside helicopters, which generally go up for about 20 [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=66.64s)]
*  minutes at a time, that's quite a lot of experience there. And what this continuity of government [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=72.64s)]
*  mission means is if there is a catastrophic event in the DC area and you need to move government [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=78.64s)]
*  officials out in a hurry, you need to have those Black Hawk pilots and crews ready to move. And as [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=86.16s)]
*  is always the case with the military, you deal with a real life scenario. You know this, you put [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=93.68s)]
*  yourself in a situation where the conditions are what they would be. So is it a congested airport? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=100.0s)]
*  Yes. Are you near a flight path? Yes. Are there commercial airlines coming in? Yes. Are you in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=105.12s)]
*  the dark? Yes. And you have to push that sort of envelope of where their understanding and all of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  these assessments are taking place. And Reid, I want to go back a little bit further. This isn't [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=115.28s)]
*  something new. This has been enacted since I spoke to a Black Hawk pilot, interviewed him yesterday. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=120.08000000000001s)]
*  He's been doing it since 2002, 2003 is when he started. It was in the wake of 9-11. So this is [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  a routine training exercise, if you want to call it that, a routine assessment. It takes place every [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=133.36s)]
*  day. If you've been to the DC area, you see Black Hawk helicopters up and down the Potomac anytime, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=140.56s)]
*  day or night, nearly constantly. So this is not anything unique. I heard you speak earlier about [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=146.24s)]
*  the ceiling that's been come into question over that 200-foot ceiling. We do know that that's a [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  strict ceiling. That much we can confirm. We spoke to folks here. It may have been considerably [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=159.04s)]
*  higher than that from open source material that you and I have both seen, maybe closer to 300 or 400 [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=165.44s)]
*  feet. So they will be looking at that. However, I've also been cautioned by army officials and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=171.12s)]
*  others who said, you've got to be careful because there is going to be some fluctuation. It was windy [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=176.39999999999998s)]
*  that night, and I can attest to that because I went out to the Potomac as soon as this happened. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=181.12s)]
*  Right. So there are different conditions and different sets within that assessment that may [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=184.64s)]
*  have caused that helicopter to have gone to an elevation or an altitude more than 200 feet. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=191.92s)]
*  That's why it's all, you know, an army official's cod that we spoke to today, they caution patients [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  until the investigation at least is underway and reveals more. Well, Charlie, we know DC is a [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=205.27999999999997s)]
*  runner city. As a runner, I've been out on the banks of this water. I've literally run the edges [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=211.44s)]
*  of this water that we've been showing you here on this map and then also in video. And anybody who [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=216.64s)]
*  does that run, they know if you're running along the Potomac River that you will see Black Hawk [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=220.96s)]
*  helicopters in these routines. Any thought that what is found out about the elevation or any other [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=225.84s)]
*  metric here could result in some changes in policy and those routines, Charlie? Well, Reid, you know, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=231.92s)]
*  in a way it actually already has happened. So the defense secretary pressed pause on any of those [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=239.84s)]
*  operations originally, the operations involving Black Hawk crews, and he put a 48-hour pause on [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  that. However, in recent hours, the FAA, which is the authority here, has actually gone a little bit [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=254.24s)]
*  further. They've actually indefinitely stopped any of these helicopters around specific paths [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=260.32s)]
*  around the airport itself because there are certain corridors, as they call them, around the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=267.6s)]
*  airport. The FAA has said, no, that's not going to happen anymore and that's indefinitely. So I think [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=272.72s)]
*  a lot of it will have to do with the investigation as it comes along. But because they haven't been [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=277.68s)]
*  able to determine exactly what happened, they have to press pause because they don't know, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=284.24s)]
*  until they figure out what went wrong, they can't fix it. So as far as we're aware now, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm almost certain that that extension will, or that 48-hour pause will be extended. The defense [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=294.56s)]
*  secretary essentially had suggested that when the pause was put in place. So the FAA, you know, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=301.76s)]
*  is the ruling authority here and indefinitely we won't see helicopters in those areas where [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=310.48s)]
*  this incident took place. They're examining the skies, the routes, and also what is in the water. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=316.24s)]
*  Charlie Daggett, thank you so much for that conversation. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOpjz6_bG0&t=321.44s)]
