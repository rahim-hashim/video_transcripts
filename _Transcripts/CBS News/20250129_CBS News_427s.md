# Warner grills RFK Jr. about federal funding freeze
**CBS News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ)
*  Senator Warner. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, I've got to tell you, for literally hundreds of thousands of Virginians, Medicaid [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=1.0s)]
*  is what prevents them from health crises on a daily and weekly basis. And some imaginary [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=8.56s)]
*  new plan. And if there was a new plan that was to be the basis of what Trump was going [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=17.3s)]
*  to do in repealing Obamacare, I would have thought by now we'd have seen it. I've got [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  to tell you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  Senator, can I reply to that? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=28.560000000000002s)]
*  Senator Kennedy, Mr. Kennedy, I've got questions. I appreciate our visit. I know you take your [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=29.88s)]
*  views seriously. And I don't reflexively vote. I voted for four of President Trump's nominees [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=36.8s)]
*  already. Got a lot of grief from folks on this panel. But I've got to tell you, I saw [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=42.2s)]
*  an email that you put out Monday night, or you campaigned it, in a fundraising email. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=47.36s)]
*  Your presidential campaign celebrated that the freeze on all new regulations, guidance [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=53.599999999999994s)]
*  and announcements is a way to protect unelected bureaucrats from further undermining our health [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=59.06s)]
*  freedom. Then you ask your donors to help pay for your campaign debt. Did your campaign [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=66.22s)]
*  and you put out that? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=71.26s)]
*  I don't think my campaign exists anymore. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=72.26s)]
*  Well, listen, I've got to tell you this. Somebody's out there soliciting money for it. Maybe you [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=74.66s)]
*  ought to find out who is. So the fact that you celebrate this freeze, do you think that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=79.94s)]
*  was a good idea to put all of this on hold for 90 days, funding and any kind of further [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=86.38s)]
*  work? NIH research? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=92.5s)]
*  As Chairman Crapo pointed out- [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=95.42s)]
*  I'm not asking for- I love Mike Crapo. I'm asking you. You're up very important position. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=98.42s)]
*  As he pointed out, Senator, the portals that were closed were not closed as a result of [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=103.84s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=109.38s)]
*  Let me just tell you this. I'd like you to explain- [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=110.38s)]
*  The purposeful policy- [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=112.38s)]
*  I'd like you to explain to a domestic violence center in Richmond that saying because this [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=113.38s)]
*  freeze they may have to close down. Where are those battered women to go? Or a rural [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=117.89999999999999s)]
*  nonprofit I've got in the Shenandoah Valley who's saying that freeze is going to potentially [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=122.34s)]
*  shut down their ability to operate. So I guess if you deny or don't know what your campaign's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=129.46s)]
*  sending out, you don't know if you raised a lot of money Monday night. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=134.5s)]
*  I'm saying that the Trump administration has- [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=137.7s)]
*  You don't know if you raised a lot of money. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=139.74s)]
*  The Trump administration has made clear that it does not want to freeze benefits for any [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=141.96s)]
*  Americans under Medicaid or Medicare, and I do not want to- [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=148.4s)]
*  There are- [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=151.84s)]
*  Disgusting Medicaid. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=152.84s)]
*  The freeze is affecting beyond Medicare and Social Security. I would hope you would have [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=153.84s)]
*  known that to be able to answer some of this. Now, you've said publicly you want to immediately [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=158.46s)]
*  of 600 NIH workers on day one. When we had our meeting, you said you actually like to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=166.32s)]
*  get rid of 2,200 people from HHS. Which offices are you going to start cutting and riffing [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=173.72s)]
*  these 2,200 workers from? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=181.32s)]
*  Senator, there's 200 political appointees that are changed during every administration. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=183.12s)]
*  So if you got rid of those 200 political appointees, you're not going to replace them with your [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=188.76s)]
*  political appointees? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=191.56s)]
*  Well, President Biden this year changed 3,000 employees at HHS. 3,750 at NIH. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=193.04s)]
*  So you're 2,200. What departments are you going to pick them from? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=201.04s)]
*  Well, the same as President Biden did when he changed 3,000 out from across all departments. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=205.44s)]
*  Let me just- [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=210.84s)]
*  I'm down to a minute. Minute 30, the chairman's been generous with colleagues on both sides [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=211.84s)]
*  and may have to go a couple minutes over. But let me just say- so let me just answer- [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=215.04s)]
*  This would be- I hope, since you're asking to become the top healthcare official in the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=219.72s)]
*  United States in terms of HHS, huge ramifications. And part of this job is to be the senior advisor [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=226.32s)]
*  to the president on health issues. So when we're looking at this purge and we're looking [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=232.44s)]
*  at letting off workers, when we're looking at potentially the president's illegal offer [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=238.27999999999997s)]
*  to try to buy out federal employees, which I would say to any federal employees, think [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=242.88s)]
*  twice, has this individual in his business world ever fulfilled his contracts or obligations [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=247.92s)]
*  to any workers in the past? But if you are in this position, will you pledge that you [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=254.16s)]
*  will not fire federal employees who work on food safety, work on trying to prevent things [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=261.16s)]
*  like salaminil? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=266.24s)]
*  Senator, there are 91,000 employees at HHS. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=267.24s)]
*  So I take that as a- that's a simple yes and I'm going to take that as a no. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=271.12s)]
*  Do you think I can run that agency without the- [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=274.32s)]
*  I take that as a no. We actually, we talked about protecting Americans from cyber criminals, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=275.36s)]
*  something we need to do a lot more on. Will you commit not to fire anyone in the health [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=282.36s)]
*  arena who currently works on protecting Americans from cyber attacks in their healthcare files? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=288.4s)]
*  I will. I will commit to not firing anybody who's doing their job. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=293.8s)]
*  Based on your opinion, based upon your opinion or your political agenda or Mr. Trump's political [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  agenda? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=306.84s)]
*  Based upon my opinion. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=307.84s)]
*  I guess that means a lot of the folks who've had any type of views on vaccines will be [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=310.84s)]
*  out of work. Will you freeze grant funding for community health centers? Will you freeze [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=315.52s)]
*  federal funds for community health centers the way the current administration's done? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=324.52s)]
*  The White House has made clear that no funds are going to be denied to any American for [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=330.12s)]
*  benefits in any program. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=335.52s)]
*  Do you know what happens at community health centers? Those are direct- [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=337.16s)]
*  Are you talking about the Indian health centers? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=339.96s)]
*  No, I'm talking about community health centers across the country. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=341.72s)]
*  I understand that. I mean, I strongly support- [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=344.96s)]
*  So you're going to excuse Indian health centers, which is good, but others are not- they're [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  going to get their funds frozen? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=351.24s)]
*  I strongly support community health centers as does the President. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=352.88s)]
*  So does that mean you're not going to freeze the funding that is currently frozen? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=356.48s)]
*  The White House has made clear that none of that funding is supposed to be frozen. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=359.84s)]
*  Sir, the direct payments are different than how the government operates. We fund the federal [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=364.67999999999995s)]
*  government down to community health centers. As a former governor, there's lots and lots [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  of state programs that are related to health care that come from the federal government. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=376.38s)]
*  They come down to the state. Then it goes to local programs. All of those don't directly [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=381.28s)]
*  pay out a dollar at a time, but they come from federal funding. They are all- even though [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=386.28000000000003s)]
*  they keep changing the guidance on a minute-by-minute basis, based upon 945 or 1030 or 1045, whatever [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  time it is today, those funds are still frozen. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=400.04s)]
*  Sir, I just honestly- I want to give you a fair shot, but I don't feel like you approach [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=402.88s)]
*  this job with the knowledge and candidly your willingness not to commit. Try to recommend [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=410.88s)]
*  to the President to make sure these funds are unfrozen and that people's lives were [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=418.64s)]
*  at stake is a very disappointing answer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxK-tU6zUmQ&t=422.4s)]
