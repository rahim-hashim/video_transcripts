# Black Hawk helicopter and a passenger jet collide near D.C.
**CBS News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw)
*  This is a CBS News special report. I'm Chris Welch in New York. We are coming on the air [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=0.0s)]
*  with breaking news out of Washington, D.C., where a commercial airliner has collided with [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=12.24s)]
*  a helicopter in midair while on approach to Reagan National Airport. The plane then crashed [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=17.76s)]
*  into the Potomac River. It was an American Airlines flight that departed from Wichita, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=24.22s)]
*  and we have the following statement from the FAA. They tell us a PSA Airlines regional jet [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=29.799999999999997s)]
*  collided in midair with a Sikorsky H-60 helicopter while on approach to runway 33 at Reagan [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=35.0s)]
*  Washington National Airport around 9 p.m. local time. PSA was operating flight 5342 for American [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=42.6s)]
*  Airlines. It departed from Wichita, Kansas. The FAA and NTSB will be investigating. The NTSB will [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=49.32s)]
*  lead the investigation. We will provide updates as information comes in. We can tell you the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=56.16s)]
*  Sikorsky H-60 is a family of military helicopters built by Sikorsky aircraft, also known more [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=62.68s)]
*  commonly as the Blackhawk. We now have our own CBS's Chris Van Cleave, our senior transportation [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=70.12s)]
*  correspondent on the phone. Chris, what can you tell us? Well, we understand there is an active [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=76.12s)]
*  rescue operation underway to try to get whoever may be in the water out of the Potomac River after [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=82.72s)]
*  what appears to be a collision between the CRJ 700. It would have been operating as an American [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=91.0s)]
*  Airlines flight, would have been painted as American Eagle. It's operated by PSA, which is [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=97.6s)]
*  an airline owned by American Airlines, and a military Blackhawk helicopter. This area is not [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=102.4s)]
*  far from Bowling Air Force Base. It's right across the river from Washington, Reagan. It appears [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=108.28s)]
*  that as this plane was coming into land, not far from the airport at all, on final approach, it [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=114.28s)]
*  somehow collided with a helicopter. DC Fire, DC Police are on scene. Coast Guard is on scene. You [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=120.68s)]
*  have a lot of resources rushing there to see who they can help to get them out of the water. It is [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=128.36s)]
*  about 37 degrees outside in Washington. They're coming out of a very cold stretch there that is [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=134.4s)]
*  very cold water. Time is of the essence. Chris, we're talking about a commercial airline crash. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=139.44s)]
*  This is something that we've not talked about in the United States since a regional flight in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  Buffalo in 2009. This was an unparalleled period of aviation safety that appears to have come to an [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=150.12s)]
*  end tonight. And Chris, I don't know if you can see the screen, the images that we're looking at [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=157.24s)]
*  right now, but it appears that just a massive response from emergency EMS crews, fire boats, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=162.67999999999998s)]
*  and the likes. And we also understand, Chris, I believe you're probably aware as well, that DCA [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  Airport has been shut down for the better part of what, since this happened, I don't even know, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=174.32s)]
*  about a half an hour ago? Correct. They are going to suspend operations while the search is ongoing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=178.44s)]
*  The most important thing right now is that search. You don't want to complicate it with air traffic [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=183.72s)]
*  coming in and out of that airport. There are a few regions in the country better equipped to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=189.32s)]
*  respond to a major alert like this than the Washington, D.C. area. You're going to have a [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  flood of resources. The question is now, can they get to people who survived what appears to be a [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=202.92s)]
*  midair collision just outside of Washington Reagan Airport over the Potomac River tonight? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=213.56s)]
*  Just remarkable images there. All right, Chris Van Cleave, thank you very much. We appreciate it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=222.44s)]
*  We will be following all the details on this developing story. We're going to keep you updated [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  as we learn more. Our coverage will continue on CBS News 24 seven, your local news and on CBS [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIdkPJx6Hw&t=230.92s)]
