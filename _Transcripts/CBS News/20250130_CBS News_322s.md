# Buttigieg responds to Trump's insults on D.C. plane crash
**CBS News:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA)
*  President Trump wasted no time placing blame on the prior administration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's listen in. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=4.32s)]
*  The FAA, which is overseen by Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a real winner, that guy's a real [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=6.12s)]
*  winner. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=13.68s)]
*  Do you know how badly everything's run since he's run the Department of Transportation? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=14.68s)]
*  He's a disaster. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=18.68s)]
*  He was a disaster as a mayor. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=21.0s)]
*  He ran his city into the ground and he's a disaster now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=23.02s)]
*  He's just got a good line of b****. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=27.04s)]
*  The Department of Transportation, his government agency charged with regulating civil aviation. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  Well, he runs it 45,000 people and he's run it right into the ground with his diversity. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=36.24s)]
*  So former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg reacting to that on X. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=44.76s)]
*  Here is his post. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=48.36s)]
*  He writes, despicable. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=49.68s)]
*  As families grieve, Trump should be leading, not lying. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=52.0s)]
*  He says, we put safety first, drove down close calls, grew air traffic control and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=54.68s)]
*  had zero commercial airline crash fatalities out of millions of flights on our watch. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=58.64s)]
*  President Trump now oversees the military and the FAA. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=64.24s)]
*  One of his first acts was to fire and suspend some of the key personnel who helped keep [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=66.86s)]
*  our skies safe. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=70.44s)]
*  Mr. Buttigieg then saying, time for the president to show actual leadership and explain what [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=72.08s)]
*  he will do to prevent this from happening again. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=76.12s)]
*  So let's bring in Linda Tran. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=79.12s)]
*  She is the former director of public engagement and senior advisor to former US Secretary [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=80.58s)]
*  of Transportation Pete Buttigieg. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=85.17999999999999s)]
*  Your thoughts about what Mr. Buttigieg had to say there? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=87.46s)]
*  Well, first of all, let me just start by saying how remarkable it is that at a time of incredible [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=90.34s)]
*  tragedy for the nation that we are seeing the great politicizing of the incident itself. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  It's not something that we should get used to. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=103.7s)]
*  It's not something that we've seen in the event of other tragedies that have happened [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=106.62s)]
*  over the many, many decades of both Republicans and Democrats at the helm of the great safety [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=109.94000000000001s)]
*  agencies that regulate the airways in our country. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=115.42s)]
*  So I just want to start there. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=118.94000000000001s)]
*  It's strange to see the political football. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=120.62s)]
*  But I also want to make clear what the secretary is talking about are the actual data. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=123.22s)]
*  So for example, part of his comment was about the air traffic controllers and the recruits [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  that have happened. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=134.06s)]
*  So during his leadership, we actually exceeded the number of recruitments for air traffic [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=135.48s)]
*  controllers last year for the very first time in decades. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=142.04s)]
*  So there's significant progress that has been made. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=146.48s)]
*  And then really big picture here, rather than get caught up in the culture wars that it's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=148.98s)]
*  clear that this president would like us to focus on what actually needs to happen fundamentally [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=154.29999999999998s)]
*  is continued, sustained, and in fact, increased investment for the Federal Aviation Administration. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  Despite the fact that the operations for the air traffic organization caps out at about [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=165.4s)]
*  ten billion dollars and just millions of that amount is dedicated towards air traffic control [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=170.16s)]
*  operations. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=176.12s)]
*  And so to be really, really clear, part of what needs to happen is a lot of investment [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=177.86s)]
*  into upgrading air traffic control towers, into upgrading technology and tools that are [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=182.44s)]
*  used to keep passengers safe and certainly not this political back and forth. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=186.74s)]
*  You've got a president of the United States, though, who's targeting Mr. Buttigieg, implying [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=191.12s)]
*  that he hired unqualified individuals with and these are the presidents who are disabilities [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=194.64s)]
*  and psychological issues. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  The president said it. So we have to ask it, were there hiring policies that put people [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=201.6s)]
*  like this in place who have, as the president said, psychological issues? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=205.28s)]
*  Absolutely a fair question. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=209.4s)]
*  And to be really clear, under the previous administration, there were very inclusive [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  hiring practices that are designed, if you think about it, to ensure that the agencies [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=215.64s)]
*  that protect Americans are educated by the lived experiences of those Americans that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=220.0s)]
*  it is designed to serve. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=225.6s)]
*  In no way, shape or form would there have been anyone in an air traffic control tower [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=227.4s)]
*  who had severe mental disabilities or would be unable to carry out the responsibilities [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=231.8s)]
*  of that job. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=237.04s)]
*  It's again, a deflection, a distraction from the fact that a very terrible thing happened [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=238.04s)]
*  today and it was under the watch of this president. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=243.04s)]
*  You say severe mental disabilities. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=246.04s)]
*  Are you personally aware of any hiring of anybody who was flagged as having any mental [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=247.8s)]
*  disabilities? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=251.60000000000002s)]
*  I am not. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=252.60000000000002s)]
*  So the president also says that people of merit should fill these government jobs. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=254.16000000000003s)]
*  What do we know about the people who are hired? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=258.28000000000003s)]
*  And we really need to be clear that we do not know if there was any connection between [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  DEI or any other policies that the president of the United States has said. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=264.92s)]
*  It is early in the investigation, but the president did have to say a lot about those [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=269.68s)]
*  DEI hires. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  You mentioned an inclusive hiring policies. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=275.0s)]
*  Do you feel that there were anybody who were hired because of DEI policy rather than merit? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=278.16s)]
*  What I can tell you is I have spent my own fair share of time in air traffic control [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=285.12s)]
*  towers all across this country. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=289.08s)]
*  And what I can tell you about the people that I've encountered is that they went through [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=291.24s)]
*  extensive training. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=294.56s)]
*  They're extraordinarily committed to the jobs and they take the safety of the flying public [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=296.08s)]
*  extraordinarily seriously. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=300.96s)]
*  There's no question in my mind that the people that are operating our air traffic control [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=303.24s)]
*  towers right now have the best interest and are incredibly talented and skilled at their [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=306.4s)]
*  jobs. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  We appreciate the conversation. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=312.68s)]
*  We know some of the questions were tough, but they have to be asked. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=314.0s)]
*  The president of the United States raises them and we have to follow up and ask. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=316.8s)]
*  So thank you so much for taking those questions. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4Mj4e9MdA&t=320.0s)]
