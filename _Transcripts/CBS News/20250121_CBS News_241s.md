# Can Trump really end birthright citizenship? The legality of Trump's executive actions
**CBS News:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc)
*  All right, let's go now to CBS News legal contributor, Jessica Levinson, to go over [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=0.0s)]
*  some of the legal details of some of Trump's sweeping immigration executive orders. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  I want to start with one of Trump's bolder orders, focusing on what we just talked about, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=9.4s)]
*  ending birthright citizenship. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=14.56s)]
*  Now, Jessica, is this even legal? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=16.84s)]
*  How can he do this? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  No, I don't think it is. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  I mean, let's be clear that there's a hierarchy of laws in our country, the Constitution, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  pieces of legislation, executive orders that can have the force of law, but you cannot [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=28.799999999999997s)]
*  executive order your way out of the Constitution. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=34.6s)]
*  The Constitution, I believe the vast majority of legal scholars, a vast majority who look [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=38.56s)]
*  at the language of the 14th Amendment and the history behind it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=45.4s)]
*  Let's remember that the 14th Amendment put into our Constitution after the Civil War [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=49.08s)]
*  to say to Black people and people who are formerly slaves, if you are born in this [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=54.24s)]
*  country, you are a full citizen, full stop. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=58.36s)]
*  It does not matter what color you are. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=61.96s)]
*  It does not matter your previous status as a slave. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=64.0s)]
*  What matters is that you were born here. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=68.16s)]
*  You are a full citizen. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=69.96s)]
*  That has always been our understanding. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=71.48s)]
*  Small, small caveat for the children of ambassadors in foreign countries. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=73.28s)]
*  Now, can you executive order your way out of that understanding? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=78.08s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=82.4s)]
*  So lots of legal questions when it comes to the other executive orders. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=83.92s)]
*  For this one, I think we're looking at the necessity of a constitutional amendment. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=89.2s)]
*  All right. I want to move on to a couple of those executive orders there, Jessica. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=94.0s)]
*  Trump also effectively ended a Biden era border app that gave nearly a million people a way [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  to start their immigration process. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  What can you tell us about that app and what it means for the people who are trying to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=105.44s)]
*  get an appointment through it? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=108.76s)]
*  Are those appointments all canceled? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  Apparently they are. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=112.0s)]
*  Reporting indicates that they are. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=112.88s)]
*  This app was a lottery system. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  And I understand that hundreds of thousands of people had tried to use it, essentially [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=117.24s)]
*  refreshing daily, hoping that they could get an appointment. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=121.8s)]
*  These are people seeking legal status and or asylum here in the country. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=126.0s)]
*  And this was a way for them to get an appointment. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  Those appointments, the reporting indicates today have now been canceled. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=135.16s)]
*  Legally speaking, any time we see policy or rule, is that something that the next administration [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=139.96s)]
*  can undo by executive order? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=147.4s)]
*  The answer is typically yes. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=149.8s)]
*  You just have to make sure they go about it the right way. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=151.76s)]
*  But to me, it looks like there aren't a lot of legal questions surrounding this, obviously [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=154.92s)]
*  huge practical impacts for people. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=159.8s)]
*  I want to move on now to Trump's plan for mass deportation, which includes deputizing [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=162.68s)]
*  local law enforcement as essentially immigration officers. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=168.44s)]
*  What would this enforcement look like and our local police departments required to comply? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=172.04s)]
*  What about sanctuary cities? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=177.2s)]
*  What about those officers? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=178.8s)]
*  Do they have to comply as well? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=179.88s)]
*  So in the Constitution, there's something called the anti-commandeering doctrine, and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=181.84s)]
*  that acknowledges that states are separate sovereigns, that the federal government cannot [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=186.64s)]
*  still tell states and local governments carry my water for me. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=191.88s)]
*  Here's my policy. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=195.68s)]
*  Now you go implement it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=196.8s)]
*  Deputizing local law enforcement means that they will assist in what is typically a federal [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  policy, for instance, immigration. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=207.08s)]
*  But you cannot, as the law currently stands, say to an unwilling state or city, you will. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=209.16000000000003s)]
*  You can say you can, but to say to California, for instance, to say to the Los Angeles Police [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=217.16000000000003s)]
*  Department, now you carry out the federal government's policy, California can say that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=224.12s)]
*  violates the 10th Amendment. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  It violates the anti-commandeering policy. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=231.32s)]
*  Jessica Levinson, I have a feeling we're going to be talking to you a lot over the next four [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=233.32s)]
*  years with all of these executive orders. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjuSi1wC5sc&t=240.2s)]
