# Federal employees received a new email about weekly tasks. Here's how agencies responded.
**CBS News:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c)
*  Well, another day, another Doge headline and deadline. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=0.0s)]
*  In fact, federal workers told once again to send an email [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=3.36s)]
*  with a list of what they accomplished last week, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=6.2s)]
*  and they have until midnight tonight to hit send. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=8.48s)]
*  So according to the memo reviewed by CBS News, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  this deadline will be a Monday night ritual [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=14.94s)]
*  going forward indefinitely. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=18.04s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News White House reporter, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  Aaron Navarro. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=22.2s)]
*  Aaron, we've seen this before. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=23.04s)]
*  Anything different about this headline? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, Reid, good to be with you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=27.88s)]
*  Just to pick up off your last point, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=28.96s)]
*  we've obtained letters now from managers [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=30.8s)]
*  at these federal agencies to employees, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=33.28s)]
*  noting what you just said, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=35.64s)]
*  that they should expect to reply to this five points email [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  every Monday going forward. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=40.2s)]
*  This time, at least compared to the first email [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=42.46s)]
*  sent from the Office of Personnel Management, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=44.84s)]
*  some of it is being handled by the agencies themselves. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=46.88s)]
*  Some of it is being sent by OPM, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  which is kind of the HR agency of the federal government, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  but other agencies are keeping it in-house as well. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=56.02s)]
*  It also allows employees to deal with sensitive information [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=59.220000000000006s)]
*  to opt out entirely of a full response to this. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=62.260000000000005s)]
*  One notable change is the Department of Defense. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=65.54s)]
*  When that first five points email came out last week, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=68.18s)]
*  they told their employees not to respond. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=71.7s)]
*  This time, Secretary Hegseth said [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=74.22s)]
*  at least civilian employees should honor the request [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=76.02000000000001s)]
*  and respond to the email. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=79.10000000000001s)]
*  So, Aaron, last week the headline was [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=80.82000000000001s)]
*  that USAID workers were given 15 minutes [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=82.78s)]
*  to pack up their desks. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=85.38s)]
*  We saw those clap outs as they walked out of those offices [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=86.42s)]
*  with their boxes in hand. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=89.78s)]
*  Now, today, we're getting news [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=91.1s)]
*  that the acting assistant administrator for USAID is on leave. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=92.66s)]
*  What can you tell us about that? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=96.3s)]
*  Yeah, this was a senior USAID official [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=99.1s)]
*  who had put a memo out just this past Friday [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  that kind of criticized the changes, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=105.46s)]
*  the gutting of USAID by the Trump administration, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=107.96s)]
*  Secretary Rubio and Doge, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=110.86s)]
*  said that it really put out obstacles there, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=113.62s)]
*  intentional and or unintentional, he writes in the memo, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=116.82000000000001s)]
*  that have wholly prevented implementation [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=120.54s)]
*  of giving humanitarian assistance abroad. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=122.58000000000001s)]
*  And he wrote in one line, quote, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=125.5s)]
*  this will no doubt result in preventable death, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=126.98s)]
*  destabilization, and threats to national security [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=129.46s)]
*  on a massive scale. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=132.3s)]
*  The memo itself is one of the more specific timelines [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=133.66s)]
*  we've seen of how Doge and Secretary Rubio [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=136.5s)]
*  have impacted USAID. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=139.70000000000002s)]
*  At one point, they mentioned how the payment systems [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=141.22s)]
*  were turned off by Doge. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=144.18s)]
*  You know, we're starting to see reaction [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=147.06s)]
*  like we were just talking about with Ed O'Keefe at town halls. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=148.98s)]
*  We know that there's been a lot of criticism [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=152.22s)]
*  at the town hall level about the thought [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=155.1s)]
*  that maybe Medicaid could be curtailed [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=157.5s)]
*  under this new administration. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=160.22s)]
*  But there was also a discussion that happened [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=162.14s)]
*  that reached a lot of people relative to social security. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=164.02s)]
*  Elon Musk on the Joe Rogan podcast, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=166.5s)]
*  he calls social security a Ponzi scheme. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=169.22s)]
*  I would imagine lawmakers are having some response to that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=172.22s)]
*  Yeah, I just checked that that interview, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=176.74s)]
*  which came out about Friday afternoon, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=178.7s)]
*  now has 8 million views. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=181.46s)]
*  So a lot of people tuning in, obviously, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=182.98s)]
*  to Rogan's platform. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=184.54s)]
*  We are seeing a lot of Congressional Democrats [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=186.3s)]
*  call what Elon Musk said, quote, outrageous. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=188.78s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders called, used this moment [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=191.74s)]
*  to kind of call on the cap for taxable income [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=194.98s)]
*  for social securities to be taken off [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=196.98s)]
*  in order to extend the program solvency. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=199.9s)]
*  So we're also seeing House Republican speaker Mike Johnson [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=201.18s)]
*  continue to say that entitlements, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=205.34s)]
*  cuts to social security, Medicare are off the table, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=208.26s)]
*  yet still call on Doge and Elon Musk [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=211.46s)]
*  to root out, quote, any waste and abuse. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=214.26s)]
*  But definitely Musk comments there, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=217.3s)]
*  leaving the door open to some sort of reform [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=219.02s)]
*  to social security. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=222.14000000000001s)]
*  We know that Doge, per employees [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=222.98000000000002s)]
*  in the Social Security Administration, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=225.26s)]
*  have been in the building, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=227.57999999999998s)]
*  and that cuts to both staffers and regional offices [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=229.17999999999998s)]
*  for the Social Security Administration [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=233.01999999999998s)]
*  are expected to happen in the next few weeks. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=234.5s)]
*  Well, somebody who has the ear of the President [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=236.66s)]
*  of the United States attended that first cabinet meeting, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=238.7s)]
*  Elon Musk, not an elected official, by the way, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=241.34s)]
*  now saying that Social Security operates as a Ponzi scheme. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=244.57999999999998s)]
*  That is a headline grabber on a Monday. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=248.01999999999998s)]
*  Aaron Navarro, good to talk to you. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=249.82s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRL-jIsf0c&t=251.18s)]
