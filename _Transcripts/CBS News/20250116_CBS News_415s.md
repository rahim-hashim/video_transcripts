# Trump's Cabinet picks grilled on Capitol Hill
**CBS News:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE)
*  Welcome back to CBS News 24 7 everybody glad to have you here I'm Reed Cowan. So CBS cameras [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=0.0s)]
*  fired up in all of the important rooms for Senate confirmation hearings are happening [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=6.48s)]
*  at this very moment for some pretty key post in President like Donald Trump's cabinet picks [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=10.56s)]
*  witnesses for attorney general nominee Pam Bondi appeared before the Senate Judiciary [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Community and Committee earlier today. Other Trump picks on Capitol Hill right now Doug [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=20.12s)]
*  Bergham for Secretary of the Interior Lee Zeldin for EPA Administrator Eric Scott Turner [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=24.58s)]
*  for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and Treasury Secretary nominee Scott Bessett. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=30.74s)]
*  Now here are just some of those moments from inside those Senate chambers. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=35.78s)]
*  If we do not fix these tax cuts, if we do not renew and extend, then we will be facing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=41.18s)]
*  an economic calamity and as always with financial instability that falls on the middle and working [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=52.66s)]
*  class people. Right now as far as we know applies only to the president and so there's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=61.9s)]
*  no immunity for Attorney General Bondi if she were to engage in illegal activity or [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=67.44s)]
*  unconstitutional activity in carrying out a directive of Donald Trump. But I think before [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=73.24s)]
*  we even get to that it would be important for her to make clear that she is not going [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=78.78s)]
*  to direct her department attorneys or the FBI to initiate unfounded investigations. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=84.34s)]
*  When energy production is restricted in America it doesn't reduce demand. It just shifts [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=93.1s)]
*  productions to countries like Russia and Iran whose autocratic leaders not only don't care [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=98.66s)]
*  at all about the environment but they use their revenues from energy sales to fund wars [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=104.1s)]
*  against us and our allies. President Trump's energy dominance vision will end those wars [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=109.66s)]
*  abroad. So just some headlines and some highlights there from those hearings. Let's go live [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=114.97999999999999s)]
*  to Capitol Hill and CBS News political reporter Torian Small. Torian AG nominee Pam Bondi [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=119.61999999999999s)]
*  will not say that Donald Trump lost the 2020 election. What is the readout there on Capitol [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=124.74s)]
*  Hill to that newsmaking item and also some of the other things that are bubbling up here [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=130.98s)]
*  in these confirmation hearings? Yeah, Reid, it is quite troublesome for Democrats but [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=135.45999999999998s)]
*  it seems to be largely inconsequential to where the votes may land. Some of Bondi's [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=142.57999999999998s)]
*  toughest critics including ranking member Dick Durbin came out of that hearing yesterday [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=148.98s)]
*  saying that they thought that she held her own throughout that very intense grilling on that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=154.88s)]
*  but also on other controversial topics like whether or not she would take the directive of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=160.4s)]
*  Donald Trump and go after some of his political rivals. To that point I do want to mention that [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  Bondi said that she is not looking or interested in seeking retribution on behalf of the Republican [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=170.44s)]
*  Party or the incoming president saying there will be no enemy lists in the Department of Justice [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=177.84s)]
*  under her leadership. But I want to circle back to Dick Durbin because I think what he said today [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=184.56s)]
*  is quite instructive. We caught up with him and he said when asked about Bondi quote he thought [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=189.16000000000003s)]
*  she was outstandingly impressive and he said he wouldn't hesitate to hire her to represent his [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=195.4s)]
*  own. So it sounds like there Reid that the top Democrat believes that she has a chance and the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  numbers just might be in her favor. That will certainly add some influence there as to voting. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  All right so also happening today House Speaker Johnson expected to announce Congressman Mike [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=210.92s)]
*  Turner's replacement for the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and really to frame this [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=215.12s)]
*  in time it comes one day after the House voted him out of that position due to quote concerns [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=220.4s)]
*  from Mar-a-Lago. Our very own Scott McFarland caught this moment that we want to show our [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=225.84s)]
*  viewers with him just a moment ago. Let's listen. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=230.88s)]
*  I have nothing but respect for Mike Turner and I'm not a negative word to let the speaker about that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=240.88s)]
*  Did you feel like you were something critical enough in receiving those? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  No I'm just I gave you my explanation and that's what it is. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=248.96s)]
*  That's what it is but it also sounds like he would very much like to move on. What's the readout there? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=252.88s)]
*  So our Margaret Brennan talked to the outgoing Intel chair Mike Turner yesterday and he told her [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=259.84s)]
*  that he was being removed or fired by Johnson because of influence from Mar-a-Lago. So there [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=267.28s)]
*  appears to be a disconnect there. Speaker Johnson as you just heard right there seems to be moving [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=272.96s)]
*  the president away from them keeping him blameless in this saying that this is now a time for reset [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=278.32s)]
*  or refresh of not just the committee but the Intel community at large. He's saying that Mar-a-Lago [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=284.08s)]
*  didn't have an influence even though Turner believes that that clearly is the case for why [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  he was removed. I will say though Democrats are quite unsettled by this development and the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=296.4s)]
*  influence by Trump. This is what Adam Schiff who was the former Intel chair when House held the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=301.84s)]
*  majority in the House but now he's a senator this is what he said about it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=307.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm just going on what Mr. Turner said about the decision essentially coming out of Mar-a-Lago [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=312.96s)]
*  but it's clear that Trump's gone the shots in the House of Representatives. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=320.56s)]
*  There was a time when some Republicans speculated about whether Trump should be or could be speaker. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=328.16s)]
*  Apparently he is playing part of that role already. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  So Turner is moving on from this. He said in a statement that he's now going to focus his [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=340.64s)]
*  efforts on the House Armed Services and Oversight Committee so no longer thinking about Intel. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=345.6s)]
*  All right so turning another page moments from now Attorney General Merrick Garland will deliver [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=351.76000000000005s)]
*  his final farewell address to the Justice Department. Do we have an idea of what he [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=355.92s)]
*  plans to say during that speech? Well Reid I would expect him to kind of mirror or parrot a lot of [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=360.88s)]
*  things that President Biden said in his farewell address talking about the dangers of weaponization [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=368.16s)]
*  of government but he'll also have to combat this wave of this incoming administration who painted [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=374.08s)]
*  the department under his leadership as this partisan biased organization and entity. He's [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=382.0s)]
*  probably going to speak to the fact that he's worked to be as bipartisan or non-partisan as [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=389.44s)]
*  he possibly can and point out the work that he's done. He was also the lead person over prosecutions [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  when it came to the January 6 attack on the Capitol so it's likely we could also expect to [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=401.6s)]
*  hear him mention that as well. Torian Small thank you so much. CBS News Political Reporter [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=406.8s)]
*  always keeping us informed. Have a great day. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fns9w_-DlE&t=412.24s)]
