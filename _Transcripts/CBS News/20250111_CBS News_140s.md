# Looting fears amid Los Angeles area wildfires
**CBS News:** [January 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs)
*  High alert for looters out here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=0.0s)]
*  They have already arrested nearly two dozen people [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=1.92s)]
*  inside evacuation areas. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=4.64s)]
*  The National Guard has been brought in to bolster security [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=6.8s)]
*  and some people have gone back home [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=9.8s)]
*  to try to defend what they have left. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=12.24s)]
*  Chris Van Cleef has that from Alta Dena. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=14.48s)]
*  The sense of loss in Alta Dena is hard to describe. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=18.64s)]
*  Destruction is everywhere. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=21.68s)]
*  And then this islet of six seemingly untouched homes [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=23.96s)]
*  saved by Pete Villani, who stayed behind [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=27.68s)]
*  to fight back the massive firestorm. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  These are all my friends. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  These are all, you know, we're a family here. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=33.84s)]
*  I love my neighbors. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=35.56s)]
*  And it's like, you feel guilty because I survived. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  I couldn't save the whole block. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  But even as he worked to put out hotspots, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=43.32s)]
*  another threat emerged, looters. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=45.32s)]
*  He says he and a neighbor have chased off two groups [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  attempting to break into the homes still standing. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=50.6s)]
*  What kind of person, what kind of human being [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=53.28s)]
*  would take advantage of somebody at that point? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=56.08s)]
*  It's just like, I don't even want to say what I would do, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  but it's shocking. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=62.36s)]
*  Did you worry about your safety [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=64.68s)]
*  when you confronted folks trying to get in that house? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=65.92s)]
*  No, I will say this. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=67.96s)]
*  It would have been a bad day for them to do anything. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=69.52s)]
*  Do you feel like you're defending your neighborhood now? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=71.92s)]
*  Yep. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=73.4s)]
*  That's why I'm here. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=74.72s)]
*  This is why I stayed. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=75.56s)]
*  He's still standing watch, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=76.72s)]
*  even as the National Guard's armored vehicles [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=78.12s)]
*  are blocking evacuated neighborhoods [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=80.28s)]
*  and police are ramping up patrols. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=82.28s)]
*  Looting has zero tolerance. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=84.64s)]
*  Looting or exploiting in the disaster areas [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=87.4s)]
*  will not be tolerated. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=89.8s)]
*  Anybody caught looting or committing crimes [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  in the affected areas will be arrested and prosecuted [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=93.16s)]
*  to the fullest extent of the law. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=95.76s)]
*  This was the view from Jonathan Eshem's home Tuesday [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=97.72s)]
*  as the eaten fire raced towards it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=100.48s)]
*  Almost what I would say the surface of the sun [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=102.8s)]
*  might look like, you know? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=105.2s)]
*  It was just pure chaos and panic everywhere. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=107.72s)]
*  He evacuated, and while the fire stayed out, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=111.76s)]
*  it appears someone tried to break in, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=114.12s)]
*  busting out a window and trying to pry this one open. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=116.36s)]
*  The idea that somebody could have been in your house [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=119.2s)]
*  while you guys were evacuated. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=120.84s)]
*  It's horrifying. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  Like, it's, I don't even want to imagine it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=125.16s)]
*  A horror disgustingly manmade [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=127.88s)]
*  in the middle of this massive natural disaster. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=130.2s)]
*  For CBS Saturday Morning, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=133.16s)]
*  I'm Chris Van Cleave in Altadena, California. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSzGzWIvDs&t=134.48s)]
