# Pope Francis alert, slept well as hospitalization for pneumonia continues, Vatican says
**CBS News:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM)
*  Pope Francis has now been in the hospital for a full week as of today [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=0.0s)]
*  The first encouraging update from the Vatican came just last night in the way of what they describe as a slight [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=4.32s)]
*  Improvement in his blood testing CBS News senior foreign correspondent Seth Doane is live from Rome [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=11.48s)]
*  Just outside the specialized hospital unit once again Seth where the Pope is being treated [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  Give us the latest update on his condition and how the Vatican is characterizing this health incident [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=23.72s)]
*  Errol I decided to keep out my phone so I could read to you the updates that we're getting so you could get a sense [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=32.8s)]
*  Of how little we're hearing each day. I'm translating from Italian the update yesterday said the Papa passed the Pope passed a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=38.36s)]
*  Tranquil evening. He woke up and had breakfast [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=46.32s)]
*  Today's update was the note was the night was a serene night the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=49.28s)]
*  Holy Father got up and did breakfast in a chair [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=54.68s)]
*  And that's what we've heard so far today. So it's really bits and pieces of information [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=58.76s)]
*  That is coming from the Vatican most of the medical news that comes out in the evening from the hospital [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=64.96s)]
*  But even that is really having to kind of read between the lines. They're saying very little there was a slight improvement though [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=70.4s)]
*  As you mentioned coming to me in the blood tests specifically the indices that look at inflammation in the Pope's blood [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=77.0s)]
*  And so that was a turn a little bit more positive last night [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=84.68s)]
*  Of course two nights ago we had had that news that no one wanted to hear about having pneumonia in both lungs [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=88.4s)]
*  So bits and pieces of information coming out here out of Jim Ellie Hospital where the Pope is being treated in a special wing his own [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  people suite [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=101.36s)]
*  You know, there are millions of people who are hanging on your every word the Vatican's every word because you know [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=103.16s)]
*  An ailing Pope is very troubling for so many [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  What is the atmosphere like if you've been able to see and get some? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=113.08s)]
*  Reporting out of Vatican City and then separately where you are whether Pope is physically in his hospital bed [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=117.64s)]
*  It's interesting because the Pope is being treated here though the world's attention is on this building [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=127.4s)]
*  He's up in a set of rooms a suite above me [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=132.76s)]
*  But if you walk in right behind me there, it's business as usual the restaurants busy the bar [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=136.48s)]
*  The coffee shop is busy and there are regular people being treated going to the emergency room [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=141.95999999999998s)]
*  It is a hospital that continues to operate as normal [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=147.64s)]
*  But in front you're starting to see people come up and they're putting little cards and making prayers [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  Also for people who are going through treatment here at this hospital [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  You're hearing the same thing around churches across Rome where people are praying for the health of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=160.4s)]
*  This Pope and one thing the Vatican is putting out which has been kind of interesting to see is messages of support going to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  Pope Francis [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=174.56s)]
*  specifically they gave us a couple of images of letters that he'd received from kids in the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=176.24s)]
*  Oncology unit the pediatric oncology unit here who were drawing or sending drawings [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  We're sending notes of well wishes letters written in Italian [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=186.56s)]
*  Hoping that the Pope has a a speedy recovery. So certainly people are [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=190.68s)]
*  Are sending their best wishes and hoping for exactly that meanwhile, we're hearing in the press not directly from the Vatican but [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=196.12s)]
*  Among doctors who have been interviewed that any recovery from something so serious would take we're talking about [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  At least a week [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=212.12s)]
*  But that is not official that's just what doctors are saying for recovering from a from a double lung pneumonia in both lungs [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=214.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah, he is a man in his 80s set down great to have you connect with us with the latest on Pope Francis's health [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5NHB6ZMNM&t=221.28s)]
