# Trump says "I was saved by God to make America great again"
**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY)
*  As fate would have it, Mark Fogel was born in a small rural town in Butler, Pennsylvania. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=0.0s)]
*  Have you heard of it? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=8.72s)]
*  Where his mother has lived for the past 78 years. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=10.22s)]
*  I just happened to go there last July 13th for a rally. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=15.32s)]
*  That was not pleasant. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=21.32s)]
*  And that is where I met his beautiful mom right before I walked onto that stage. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=24.3s)]
*  And I told her I would not forget what she said about her son. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=32.22s)]
*  And I never did, did I? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=36.620000000000005s)]
*  Never forgot. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=38.14s)]
*  Less than 10 minutes later, at that same rally, gunfire rang out and a sick and deranged assassin [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=40.14s)]
*  unloaded eight bullets from his sniper's perch into a crowd of many thousands of people. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=49.38s)]
*  My life was saved by a fraction of an inch, but some were not so lucky. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=56.06s)]
*  Cory Comparator was a firefighter, a veteran, a Christian, a husband, a devoted father, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=63.02s)]
*  and above all, a protector. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=70.74000000000001s)]
*  When the sound of gunshots pierced the air, it was a horrible sound. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=73.98s)]
*  Cory knew instantly what it was and what to do. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=79.17999999999999s)]
*  He threw himself on top of his wife and daughters and shielded them from the bullets with his [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=83.61999999999999s)]
*  own body. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=90.34s)]
*  Cory was hit really hard. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=92.78s)]
*  You know the story from there. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=96.17999999999999s)]
*  He sacrificed his life to save theirs. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=97.62s)]
*  Two others, very fine people, were also seriously hit. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=101.14s)]
*  But thankfully, with the help of two great country doctors, we thought they were gone [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=106.06s)]
*  and they were saved, so those doctors had great talent, were joined by Cory's wife, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=112.26s)]
*  Helen, who was his high school sweetheart, and their two beloved daughters, Allison and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=119.26s)]
*  Kaylee. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=125.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=126.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=135.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=137.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=139.98s)]
*  To Helen, Allison, and Kaylee, Cory is looking down on his three beautiful ladies right now, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=161.98s)]
*  and he is cheering you on. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=169.14000000000001s)]
*  He loves you. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=170.82s)]
*  He is cheering you on. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=171.82s)]
*  Cory was taken from us much too soon, but his destiny was to leave us all with a shining [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=174.5s)]
*  example of the selfless devotion of a true American patriot. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=180.18s)]
*  It was love like Cory's that built our country, and it's love like Cory's that is going to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=186.1s)]
*  make our country more majestic than ever before. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=190.54s)]
*  I believe that my life was saved that day in Butler for a very good reason. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=195.54000000000002s)]
*  I was saved by God to make America great again. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=201.38000000000002s)]
*  I believe that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=204.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUzBe4D8KY&t=208.34s)]
