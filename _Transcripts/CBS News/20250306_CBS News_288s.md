# Trump announces some Mexico tariffs pause after Sheinbaum conversation
**CBS News:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ)
*  So we are also watching your money right now, the Dow, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=0.0s)]
*  as investors react to the news of President Trump [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  giving Mexico a one-month reprieve [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=5.9s)]
*  from his latest tariffs. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=7.8s)]
*  But you see right there behind me, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=9.0s)]
*  we are well into negative territory again today. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=10.24s)]
*  In a post to social media, Mr. Trump says, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=13.84s)]
*  quote, after speaking with the president, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=15.94s)]
*  Claudia Scheinbaum of Mexico, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=17.68s)]
*  I have agreed that Mexico will not be required [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=19.28s)]
*  to pay tariffs on anything that falls [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=21.88s)]
*  under the USMCA agreement. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=23.66s)]
*  This agreement is until April 2nd. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=26.32s)]
*  I did this as an accommodation, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=28.12s)]
*  and out of respect for the president there, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  our relationship has been a very good one, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=32.0s)]
*  and we are working hard together on the border, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=33.66s)]
*  both in terms of stopping illegal aliens [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=36.14s)]
*  from entering the United States, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=37.8s)]
*  and likewise, stopping fentanyl. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=38.98s)]
*  Still though, the markets are speaking today. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=42.2s)]
*  So let's talk about this. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=43.68s)]
*  CBS News contributor, Javier David joins us live. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  Javier, what goods fall under the US-Mexico-Canada agreement [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=47.08s)]
*  that he references there, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=51.18s)]
*  and what does it mean for Americans [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  who are racing for price hikes [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=53.68s)]
*  and also watching that negative territory [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=55.22s)]
*  play out right now on the Dow? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=57.16s)]
*  It really means, for now, aside from autos, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=60.42s)]
*  it really is agriculture products. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=62.62s)]
*  Potash is a key Canadian good that we import, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=64.56s)]
*  and the GOP we know has been sort of lobbying [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=69.46000000000001s)]
*  to get some exemptions for that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=72.2s)]
*  Also watch avocados. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=73.98s)]
*  They're in the crossfire. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=75.34s)]
*  If you're a big avocado eater, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=76.68s)]
*  your avocado toast, or whatever you like on your salad, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=79.14s)]
*  you're going to be more than likely paying [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=82.52s)]
*  for that, more money for that as well. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=84.82s)]
*  But we're looking at a lot of policy whiplash [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=87.5s)]
*  and sort of these decisions being made by Fiat, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  and it makes it really hard, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=92.84s)]
*  both for companies to decide [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=94.84s)]
*  what they're going to charge consumers, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=96.04s)]
*  and B, what consumers can expect [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=97.98s)]
*  when they go to the supermarket, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=99.82000000000001s)]
*  they go to the store, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=101.68s)]
*  and they're looking for their favorite good. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=103.12s)]
*  There's more than likely going to be [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=105.78s)]
*  some sort of price hike, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=108.42s)]
*  and they're not prepared for it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, you mentioned avocados. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=111.86s)]
*  There's a San Francisco touchstone to that today, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=113.22s)]
*  and we're also reportedly reporting out of the Bay Area, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=115.88s)]
*  guacamole at one restaurant shooting from $13 [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=117.88s)]
*  to almost $17 for a bowl about this big [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=120.68s)]
*  for our viewers to see. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=124.76s)]
*  So we are seeing the ripple effects already. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=126.72s)]
*  Mr. Trump has maintained, though, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=128.06s)]
*  that tariffs really give him leverage for bargaining, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=129.22s)]
*  but the question is, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=131.36s)]
*  will that leverage work in the bargaining? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=133.0s)]
*  What is the impact on Americans, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=135.9s)]
*  especially those of us watching our 401Ks, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=137.74s)]
*  while he really rolls the dice [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=140.4s)]
*  on whether this tariff leverage will work? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=141.94s)]
*  And look, we all sort of presume [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=146.68s)]
*  that leverage is what he was seeking, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=149.02s)]
*  but when the tariffs actually got implemented, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=150.62s)]
*  that unnerved markets, it unnerved consumers, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=153.42000000000002s)]
*  it unnerved companies. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=156.06s)]
*  Leverage is one thing, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=157.62s)]
*  but you have to have clarity with that leverage, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=158.86s)]
*  and the fact that, again, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=160.70000000000002s)]
*  over the last several days, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  it's like tariffs are on, but tariffs are off, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=163.46s)]
*  but maybe they're on for certain products, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=165.36s)]
*  and off for autos, and off or on for agricultural goods. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=167.44000000000003s)]
*  It's really the uncertainty, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  and it's that whole sort of whiplash [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=172.98000000000002s)]
*  effect that makes it impossible [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=174.46s)]
*  for companies to plan for these things. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=175.7s)]
*  And again, consumers, they can't really grasp [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=177.26s)]
*  what's happening, and much of what is unfolding [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=182.28s)]
*  in the market is, in fact, due to that uncertainty [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=184.18s)]
*  and the lack of clarity from the administration. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=187.48s)]
*  Right, and who's to say when prices go up, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=190.48s)]
*  if those tariffs disappear [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=192.48s)]
*  and the cost of doing business goes down, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  who's to say those retailers [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=196.46s)]
*  won't just keep the prices where they are? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=197.72s)]
*  The president himself said it's hard to get prices down. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=199.82s)]
*  So let's talk about layoffs. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=202.58s)]
*  As Elon Musk, he really takes a sledgehammer, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=203.78s)]
*  a knife, to the federal government structure. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=205.82s)]
*  Now we're starting to see the fallout. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=208.32s)]
*  What can you tell us about that from your perspective? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=209.86s)]
*  Yeah, we had some data this morning [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=213.16s)]
*  that also sort of further unnerved markets. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=214.46s)]
*  There was a surge in layoffs. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=216.7s)]
*  Challenger Gray is a closely followed indicator. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=219.2s)]
*  Basically, much of what we're seeing, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=222.6s)]
*  a chunk of what those layoffs consisted of, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=224.7s)]
*  were from government positions, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=227.54s)]
*  where some of these agencies were victims of the Doge cuts. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=230.46s)]
*  And really what you have is a couple of things playing out. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=234.46s)]
*  You have a weakened labor market [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=237.9s)]
*  that was already weakening, that was already soft, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=240.3s)]
*  and it's converging with sort of ambient fears [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=242.5s)]
*  about a sharper slowdown and a recession. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=245.08s)]
*  And now we have what appears to be a full-fledged trade war [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=247.68s)]
*  barring some really dramatic change. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=251.42000000000002s)]
*  You have a labor market that is not as strong [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  as you have a labor market that was already [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=259.36s)]
*  sort of leaning toward weakness. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=260.72s)]
*  It's going to get weaker and now you have massive cuts. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=262.8s)]
*  So this is not a good thing for the administration [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=265.26s)]
*  because 100 days or less than 100 days in, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=267.74s)]
*  or really two months in, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=270.54s)]
*  you're getting headlines about massive cuts [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=272.1s)]
*  and this will start to be reflected in the jobs data. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=274.18s)]
*  And one of those reports we'll get on Friday. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=276.74s)]
*  Well, it's great to talk to you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=279.94s)]
*  And we are looking live right now at the big board [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=281.02000000000004s)]
*  as we continue to see markets wobble in response. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=283.78000000000003s)]
*  Thank you so much for that conversation. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_smCgKAFyQ&t=286.78s)]
