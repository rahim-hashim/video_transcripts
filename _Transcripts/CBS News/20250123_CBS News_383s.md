# Catholic bishop weighs in on Trump's immigration crackdown
**CBS News:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY)
*  A growing number of church leaders are criticizing President Trump's immigration policies. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=0.0s)]
*  A prominent Catholic church leader said, quote, some provisions containing the executive orders, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=5.2s)]
*  such as those focused on the treatment of immigrants and refugees, are deeply troubling [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=9.64s)]
*  and will have negative consequences, in their view. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=13.6s)]
*  Let's bring in now Bishop Mark Seitz. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=16.68s)]
*  He's the chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops Committee on Migration. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=18.68s)]
*  Bishop, thanks for being here. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  We appreciate you taking the time. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=24.44s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be with you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=26.16s)]
*  Is the Catholic Church in the United States taking a formal position on President Trump's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=28.72s)]
*  immigration policies in recent days? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=33.9s)]
*  We are. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  We think we have to speak to many of these policies, which we see as going against some [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  of the basic tenets of our faith, frankly. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=44.64s)]
*  The fundamental right of every human person that need to be respected, no matter their [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  origin, no matter their situation. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=57.64s)]
*  What is the strategy for the church in the United States, if any, in terms of dealing [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  with this administration beyond the immigration issues this week? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=67.2s)]
*  How do you, do you have a big picture, four-year approach to how you're going to handle this [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=70.96s)]
*  moment? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=75.24s)]
*  Well, I think all of us are, in the church and without, are looking to see what shape [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=76.48s)]
*  this administration takes and what positions they actually land on. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  I don't think any of us knows exactly, but things have come into a clearer light in regard [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  to the immigration questions right now, and so we're responding to those. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  Is the Vatican paying close attention to what's happening here in the U.S. and Pope Francis? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=103.16s)]
*  Are they keeping tabs on this through the conference, and do they expect, do you expect [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  Catholic leaders, including the pope, to meet with President Trump at some point this year? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, I can't say what Pope Francis' plans might be, but he certainly is paying attention [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=117.36000000000001s)]
*  and he has spoken to some of the concerns based on what the president, now president, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=125.36000000000001s)]
*  said during his campaign. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=133.32s)]
*  He expressed a great deal of concern about some of the proposals. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=136.08s)]
*  You've talked about in your statement in recent days that the president needs to be [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=141.28s)]
*  more merciful, to pick out a word I saw in that statement. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=145.6s)]
*  What do you mean by that when it comes to politics and policy? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=149.68s)]
*  How does that translate into what you would like to see happen? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=152.52s)]
*  From a Christian point of view, there's no way to really speak about justice without [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=157.16s)]
*  mercy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=160.8s)]
*  Mercy is part of it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=162.24s)]
*  You can't simply take a law and then present it as though it is, its literal wording explains [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=163.32s)]
*  the whole or deals with the whole reality. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=175.12s)]
*  So mercy has to be, has to temper the way that justice is practiced. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=178.6s)]
*  And very often with a sweeping kind of statements that are coming from the administration, we [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=185.2s)]
*  don't see that happening. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=193.36s)]
*  Bishop, you are in El Paso, Texas near the U.S.-Mexican border. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=195.0s)]
*  What's your own personal experience with migrants and dealing with migrant issues? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=199.88s)]
*  Well our church has actually received many immigrants after they were processed by the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=206.24s)]
*  border patrol and in their journey on to other locations. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=213.0s)]
*  So we've had the chance to interact with thousands of people who had passed through. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=220.28s)]
*  I can say for instance in the shelter that was run by our diocese that in years of receiving [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=227.2s)]
*  people we had not one violent incident in that shelter in all of those years. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=236.68s)]
*  In fact, we saw a great deal of faith. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=245.28s)]
*  We saw a great deal of goodness. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=249.18s)]
*  They were all ready to help us in the shelter and do whatever they could with a great deal [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=254.18s)]
*  of gratitude for the assistance we gave. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=261.98s)]
*  And just finally Bishop, when you think about the Catholic Church in the United States, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=266.14s)]
*  some parishioners at your church and in your area and others across the country might agree [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=272.0s)]
*  with your position on immigration, they might disagree. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=277.16s)]
*  What do you say to those who disagree with the church's official position and how should [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=279.26000000000005s)]
*  they handle it in your view as a church official? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=283.02000000000004s)]
*  Well the way that our church is set up, we do have a hierarchy and there are those who [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=286.82000000000005s)]
*  are appointed to be faithful to the teachings of Christ. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=295.02000000000004s)]
*  Of course the pope is the main representative of that and he sums up the authority of the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=298.3s)]
*  church. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=306.36s)]
*  There are also bishops who along with him come together and affirm that teaching and [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=307.36s)]
*  we believe that those who are in that position are given the assistance of the Holy Spirit. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=314.52s)]
*  So I'm not saying that everything a bishop says or even a pope says is absolutely defined [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=321.56s)]
*  by that, but one who hears what the leaders of the church are saying as a Catholic Christian [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=329.4s)]
*  certainly needs to take it very seriously. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=336.34s)]
*  Step back, don't just react. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=339.02s)]
*  Listen, read the gospels because that's where we get most of our stuff. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=340.97999999999996s)]
*  And just real quick, one final question. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=346.7s)]
*  Cardinal Dolan, many Americans saw the Archbishop of New York gave an invocation, spoke at President [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=349.17999999999995s)]
*  Trump's inaugural. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=356.2s)]
*  Where does he stand versus where the U.S. conference stands on this issue? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=358.12s)]
*  If you go back to the last several months and look at his statements, you'll find no [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=361.68s)]
*  stronger spokesperson for the dignity and rights of immigrants than Cardinal Dolan. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=367.68s)]
*  Bishop Mark Seitz in El Paso, Texas, thank you. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=376.84s)]
*  My pleasure, thank you. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlRO40d1RGY&t=380.88s)]
