# Biden-era acting OPM director reacts to Elon Musk asking federal workers to justify their jobs
**CBS News:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc)
*  As we've been reporting, Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOJ, is asking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=0.0s)]
*  federal employees to detail what they did last week or resign. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=4.5s)]
*  The directive came in the form of an email from the Office of Personnel Management, or [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=8.32s)]
*  OPM, which oversees recruitment, health insurance, and benefits for federal employees. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=12.16s)]
*  Despite Musk claiming no response would be considered a resignation, several agencies [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=17.84s)]
*  have instructed employees to ignore the email, and two officials now say OPM has told agencies [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=22.36s)]
*  they can decide how they want to handle the directive. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=28.060000000000002s)]
*  Rob Schreiver joins us now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=30.82s)]
*  He's the former acting director at the Office of Personnel Management during the Biden administration [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=32.5s)]
*  and a senior advisor with the group Democracy Forward. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=36.7s)]
*  That organization has sued the Trump administration more than a dozen times. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=39.980000000000004s)]
*  Rob, thank you for being here. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=43.260000000000005s)]
*  What's your reaction to this email, how it's being characterized, and sort of the conflicting [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=45.14s)]
*  guidance about who needs to respond? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=49.18000000000001s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Lindsay. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=52.260000000000005s)]
*  I mean, this is really right out of the Keystone Cops, right? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=53.260000000000005s)]
*  Everything starts with a post on X, a Saturday afternoon from Elon Musk warning federal employees [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=56.3s)]
*  they're going to get this email, and if they don't fill it out and respond, they're going [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=62.5s)]
*  to have to be deemed to have resigned. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=66.7s)]
*  Trump's own officials immediately start pushing back on this, tell their workforce, don't [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=69.86s)]
*  reply to this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=74.78s)]
*  The president then is sitting with President Macron from France and talking about how they [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  They do have to respond to this, and they're going to find dead federal employees through [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=81.58s)]
*  this email. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=86.02s)]
*  Now, OPM has backed away altogether. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=87.02s)]
*  So this is just yet one more example of inefficiency coming out of Doge. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=89.82s)]
*  Is this type of vettings of productivity something that the OPM would normally do, or is this [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=94.53999999999999s)]
*  completely unprecedented? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=100.38s)]
*  So OPM would set the rules and policies for federal agencies to do this kind of performance [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=102.34s)]
*  management for their workforces. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=108.46s)]
*  That's a good thing, right, for a manager to understand the contributions that their [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=111.06s)]
*  employees have made on a week-to-week basis. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=116.10000000000001s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=118.54s)]
*  But having this go through OPM, this really small agency, and ask 2.2 million employees [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=120.10000000000001s)]
*  to send back five bullet points, I mean, that's not performance management. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=126.9s)]
*  That's a stunt. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=131.22s)]
*  CBS News has also learned that OPM is floating the idea of having agencies do weekly accounting [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=132.22s)]
*  of their staff's work and report it back to OPM. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=138.82s)]
*  Nothing's been finalized, but do you think that would be realistic? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=142.42s)]
*  I just think that when you're talking about a federal government that has 2.2 million [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=146.1s)]
*  employees who 85% are outside of Washington, D.C., the focus for performance management [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=150.45999999999998s)]
*  should be at the supervisory level. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=157.94s)]
*  And that's where OPM is really strong, right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  Like, it provides training, it provides guidance, it provides tools to supervisors to help them [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=162.57999999999998s)]
*  do this performance management because those supervisors are the ones that are close enough [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=167.70000000000002s)]
*  to the job to understand how the employee is contributing. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=172.1s)]
*  OPM is not. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=175.46s)]
*  I got to be really quick with you on this, but have you heard from workers about this? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=176.86s)]
*  I mean, I know that people say it's normal to change the top of command during administrations, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=180.38s)]
*  but a lot of these people are civil servants. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=185.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I have heard from workers on this. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=187.66s)]
*  They're really struggling. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=191.66s)]
*  They're trying to kind of keep up with all of the inconsistencies that are coming. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=192.70000000000002s)]
*  We all knew that Project 2025 was going to be a thing, and Democracy Forward was prepared for that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=196.98s)]
*  That's why we have sued the administration 12 times. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=202.18s)]
*  We're trying to get good information out to federal employees through civilservicestrong.org [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=205.46s)]
*  so that they have an alternative to the information that's coming out from OPM. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=209.57999999999998s)]
*  These are folks that just want to work on behalf of the American people day in and day out. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=214.5s)]
*  They don't care who the political leaders are. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=219.1s)]
*  They just want clear direction. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  They want to be able to contribute to the agency's mission like they've been trained to do. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  Rob Schreiver, thank you. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhGkfbomfc&t=226.78s)]
