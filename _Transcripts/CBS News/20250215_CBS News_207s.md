Video Description: The Department of Justice has filed paperwork to drop the charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The move came after more than a half-dozen federal prosecutors who raised concerns about the order after the deputy attorney general said a prosecution would hinder Adams' ability to assist the Trump administration with its immigration policies. President Trump has denied any involvement in the case.

*  Willie, good morning. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=43.2s)]
*  Good morning to you, Michelle. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  Danielle Sassoon, the acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=48.64s)]
*  was the first to resign in protest this week. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  And now she's receiving the support from at least seven former U.S. attorneys who served [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=56.0s)]
*  in that role. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=61.12s)]
*  This comes as the Department of Justice moves to dismiss the charges in the case [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=61.92s)]
*  against New York Mayor Eric Adams. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  In a Friday court filing, federal prosecutors moved to abandon a corruption case targeting [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=69.84s)]
*  New York City Mayor Eric Adams. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=75.44s)]
*  The motion still needs to be approved by a judge, but it has caused internal drama for [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=77.52s)]
*  attorney general Pam Bondi. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=81.92s)]
*  Martha, I'm on a different time zone, but it's my understanding it is being dismissed [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=83.84s)]
*  today. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=87.84s)]
*  The shakeup at the DOJ was sparked by a memo sent earlier this week by acting deputy attorney [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=88.56s)]
*  general Emil Bov√© instructing federal prosecutors to abandon the charges against Adams. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=94.16s)]
*  That led to the resignation of acting Manhattan U.S. attorney Danielle Sassoon, who was [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=100.16s)]
*  overseeing the case. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  Sassoon sent a resignation letter to attorney general Bondi saying she was baffled by the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=107.04s)]
*  move to dismiss the case. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=112.32s)]
*  She also alleged the mayor's legal team was working to thwart the charges against him [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=114.0s)]
*  in exchange for the mayor's assistance in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=118.55999999999999s)]
*  something Adams denied on Friday. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  Think about my attorney, Alex Spira, one of the top trial attorneys in the country. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=125.36s)]
*  Imagine him going inside saying that the only way Mayor Adams is going to assist in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=133.44s)]
*  immigration, which I was calling for since 2022, is if you drop the charges. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=140.88s)]
*  That's quid pro quo. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=145.44s)]
*  That's a crime. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=146.32s)]
*  At least seven DOJ officials have resigned in protest. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=147.04s)]
*  The internal shakeup at the DOJ comes as the Trump administration is moving swiftly to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=150.88s)]
*  reshape and downsize the federal government. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=155.6s)]
*  Several federal agencies have started to lay off hundreds of employees who are under a [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=158.56s)]
*  probationary period. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=163.44s)]
*  We've also begun the process of canceling a significant number of contracts, and as far [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=165.12s)]
*  as the layoffs go, I don't have the exact number, but yes, those will be forthcoming as well. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=169.92s)]
*  The layoffs are in addition to a proposed buyout plan offered by the Trump administration, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=174.55999999999997s)]
*  which it says 75,000 workers have accepted. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=179.2s)]
*  The cost-cutting effort is led by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOJ. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=182.56s)]
*  More layoffs could be on the way. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=190.64s)]
*  The Office of Personnel Management has notified government agencies that they have until [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=192.39999999999998s)]
*  Tuesday, 8 p.m., to compile all of the numbers of the employees affected by the layoffs. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=196.88s)]
*  Dana? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  Another busy week, Willie. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=204.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7H5WfSfzw&t=205.68s)]
