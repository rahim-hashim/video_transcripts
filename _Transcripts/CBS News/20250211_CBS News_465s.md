# Eric Adams praises DOJ for dropping criminal charges
**CBS News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo)
*  Welcome back. New York City Mayor Eric Adams. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=0.0s)]
*  Legal troubles are no more, at least for now. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=2.6s)]
*  Federal prosecutors were directed to dismiss his case [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=6.0s)]
*  involving illegal campaign contributions [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=9.0s)]
*  from foreign nationals. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=11.8s)]
*  You may remember Mayor Adams was indicted in September [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=13.3s)]
*  on charges including conspiracy, wire fraud, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=16.1s)]
*  solicitating illegal foreign campaign contributions [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=19.3s)]
*  from foreign nationals, and bribery. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=23.1s)]
*  Adams has pleaded not guilty to all of those charges. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=25.5s)]
*  The mayor took to the podium moments ago [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=29.4s)]
*  and had this to say about the development. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  Listen in. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=34.0s)]
*  My fellow New Yorkers, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=35.6s)]
*  as you may have heard, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=38.1s)]
*  the Department of Justice has directed [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=40.5s)]
*  that the case against me be dismissed, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=43.8s)]
*  finally ending a months-long saga [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=47.8s)]
*  that put me, my family, and this city [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=51.7s)]
*  through an unnecessary ordeal. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=55.2s)]
*  As I said from the outset, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=58.1s)]
*  I never broke the law, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  and I never would. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=63.1s)]
*  I would never put any personal benefit [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=65.6s)]
*  above my solemn responsibility as your mayor. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=68.4s)]
*  It is worth repeating the facts [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=73.0s)]
*  because many sensational and false claims have been made. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=74.8s)]
*  So let me be clear. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=80.4s)]
*  I never ask anyone to break the law on my behalf [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=82.7s)]
*  or on behalf of my campaign. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=87.10000000000001s)]
*  Never. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=90.3s)]
*  And I absolutely never traded my power [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=91.9s)]
*  as an elected official for any personal benefit. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=95.10000000000001s)]
*  No witness ever came forward publicly [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  to make claims against me. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=102.9s)]
*  None of the baseless threats from prosecutors [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  of new charges [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=109.10000000000001s)]
*  and the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=111.7s)]
*  CPS News Senior Coordinating Producer [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=116.36s)]
*  Anna Schechter is following all of this closely [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=119.3s)]
*  and she joins us now. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=122.3s)]
*  Anna, so nice to finally meet you once again. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=123.3s)]
*  So I want to know your reaction [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=126.9s)]
*  from what you just heard from Mayor Adams. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=128.7s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=131.3s)]
*  Well, I just keep thinking [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=134.3s)]
*  when this news broke of the indictment, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=136.2s)]
*  the page of a description of these elaborate trips overseas, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=138.5s)]
*  five-star hotels in Istanbul, for example, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=143.7s)]
*  all at the same time receiving campaign donations [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=148.6s)]
*  from straw donors and then pushing through [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=154.7s)]
*  or the allegation of pushing through an approval [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=158.6s)]
*  for a Turkish consulate here in New York City [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=161.9s)]
*  without the proper safety measures, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=165.1s)]
*  pressuring the fire department to make those approvals. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=167.5s)]
*  So when I hear him talking about that, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=170.7s)]
*  it doesn't really jive with the story [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=172.4s)]
*  that prosecutors were telling in that indictment. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=175.2s)]
*  And I think a lot of New Yorkers were looking forward [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=179.5s)]
*  to sort of letting the case take its course [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=182.4s)]
*  and the judicial process take its course. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=185.4s)]
*  Now the Department of Justice in such an unprecedented way [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=189.2s)]
*  citing the focus on President Trump's immigration crackdown [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=194.1s)]
*  as a reason for pushing all of these allegations aside. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=199.8s)]
*  And if you read that memorandum that came down last evening, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=203.4s)]
*  the Department of Justice was very careful to say [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=207.8s)]
*  we're not this is not about the merits of the case [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  or the integrity of the case, but rather it's about two things. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=212.5s)]
*  One, the timing. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=216.9s)]
*  Mayor Adams is up for reelection in November. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=218.5s)]
*  And two, and they really emphasize this, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=222.0s)]
*  so it seems more important to the Department of Justice [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=224.10000000000002s)]
*  that this case was interfering with his ability [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=227.10000000000002s)]
*  to devote his attention to or getting in line [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=230.60000000000002s)]
*  with President Trump's efforts to weed out illegal immigrants, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=234.20000000000002s)]
*  particularly those with criminal backgrounds. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  And Anna, I just wanted to follow up on that [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  just so our viewers understand here [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=244.3s)]
*  because dropping these charges, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=246.0s)]
*  that does not necessarily mean that prosecutors [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=247.60000000000002s)]
*  didn't have enough evidence to move forward with the case, correct? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=249.8s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=254.5s)]
*  And it's not exactly dropping them altogether. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=256.5s)]
*  It's dropping them for now. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=259.8s)]
*  If you read between the lines and actually read the fine print here, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=261.6s)]
*  what they're saying is this case will come under review [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=266.1s)]
*  after the November election, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=270.6s)]
*  that whomever the Trump administration is going to appoint [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=273.1s)]
*  to lead the Southern District of New York, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=277.0s)]
*  very important office under DOJ's purview, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=280.09999999999997s)]
*  whoever gets that job is going to review this after the election. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=289.09999999999997s)]
*  So let's wait and see. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  Now, the legal experts that I've spoken to early this morning said [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=296.09999999999997s)]
*  it's so blatantly political. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=299.9s)]
*  This is really about the Trump administration saying, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=302.9s)]
*  okay, Mayor Adams, we're going to push this aside. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  Let's see if you fall in line with our policies. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=309.3s)]
*  And if you do, well, you know, let's see what happens after the November election. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=312.0s)]
*  So it's really unprecedented. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  I've never seen anything like this before in 20 years covering these types of cases. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=320.1s)]
*  So it's really everybody here in New York City is buzzing about it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=326.90000000000003s)]
*  But also in Washington, this is, you know, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=330.6s)]
*  coming on the heels of a slew of executive orders that have been unprecedented. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=333.5s)]
*  So interesting times that we are living in and we get to watch it [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=337.79999999999995s)]
*  with a front row seat here at CBS News. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, very interesting indeed. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=344.9s)]
*  So how are the mayor's opponents reacting to this news? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=346.4s)]
*  Oh, they have come out of the woodwork to say that Mayor Adams sold out New York City. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=351.9s)]
*  Remember, this is a campaigning time. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=357.2s)]
*  There's an election coming up later on this year. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=361.0s)]
*  And so his opponents, the most vocal of them, are actually running for reelection. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=363.9s)]
*  But you have a serious cohort. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=369.4s)]
*  Of course, he has his supporters, but he absolutely has detractors who know him from his time at NYPD, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=371.8s)]
*  from his time as Brooklyn Bureau president. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=379.0s)]
*  There's a lot of chatter amongst my sources who've known him for a long time, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=383.0s)]
*  who say that he actually doesn't respect the rule of law. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=386.6s)]
*  You just heard him say that he absolutely does. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=389.5s)]
*  He's never asked anyone to break the law on his behalf. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=392.0s)]
*  So it's a real political and legal drama playing out here in New York City. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=396.5s)]
*  And I have to ask the big picture here. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=401.3s)]
*  Does this set a precedent for other cases to be dismissed for political officials [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=403.9s)]
*  who maybe fall in line with the president? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=408.4s)]
*  That is a great question because this is unprecedented. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=412.7s)]
*  I guess by default, it could set a precedent. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=417.1s)]
*  Let's see how this plays out. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=420.0s)]
*  I think most legal experts think that the Southern District will fall in line, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=421.5s)]
*  will drop the charges or at least push this case aside, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=426.40000000000003s)]
*  drop the charges for now and then review it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=429.90000000000003s)]
*  But it remains to be seen. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=432.70000000000005s)]
*  Well, let's see. Perhaps right now there is an acting lead of the Southern District of New York. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=434.3s)]
*  Right now, Danielle Sassoon. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=442.20000000000005s)]
*  Let's see what she does. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=443.8s)]
*  So far, she's declined to comment. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=444.90000000000003s)]
*  So I suppose we could see pushback on this, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=447.0s)]
*  but I don't really expect to since the decree in the memorandum was so clear [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go1Zc_umJVo&t=450.9s)]
