# Breaking down the fallout from Trump and Zelenskyy's Oval Office meeting
**CBS News:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA)
*  But let's begin this morning at the White House in the fallout from the Friday encounter [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=0.0s)]
*  in the Oval Office. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=4.0s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he is ready to sign the U.S. minerals deal, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  but everyone is still talking about the unprecedented exchange with President Trump and Vice President [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=9.36s)]
*  Vance. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=15.14s)]
*  This weekend, European leaders stood in solidarity with Zelensky, but many lawmakers in Washington, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=16.14s)]
*  Republicans mostly, questioned whether any kind of deal with the U.S. is still possible. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=21.28s)]
*  Everybody's saying security guarantees to secure the peace. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  You first have to have a peace. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=28.7s)]
*  The White House has become an arm of the Kremlin. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=30.02s)]
*  The fact is this, Vladimir Putin is a brutal dictator. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=33.58s)]
*  Russia started this war. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=36.9s)]
*  All President Zelensky had to do was come in and sign this economic agreement and again [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=38.78s)]
*  show no daylight, no daylight between Ukrainian people and the American people. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=44.379999999999995s)]
*  And he chose to blow that up. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=49.64s)]
*  CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes is live from the White House and joins [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=52.42s)]
*  me now to talk about it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=56.2s)]
*  So, Nancy, I just want a little bit of a recap from what happened on Friday. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=58.42s)]
*  I mean, and we sort of broke it down in the introduction, but I think what's getting sort [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  of lost in the context, and I'm curious what the administration is saying, it's not so [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=67.94s)]
*  much that the American people don't understand that billions of dollars have been spent to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=72.22s)]
*  help Ukraine push back Russian aggression. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=75.98s)]
*  It's not that perhaps Americans are tired when they know that there are things that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=78.9s)]
*  need to be fixed at home. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  What seems to me, what strikes me is what got lost in the context is Zelensky saying [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=85.22s)]
*  he doesn't have any, the fact that the White House is willing to trust Vladimir Putin's [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=89.46s)]
*  word without any security guarantees that the United States would make to his country [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=95.78s)]
*  is the only thing he was questioning, which is I want peace, but if I don't have any guarantee [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=100.7s)]
*  that Vladimir Putin's not going to throw out whatever we decide out the window, then how [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=105.22s)]
*  can I sign anything that you're putting in front of me? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=109.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=112.86s)]
*  And that is the main sticking point between Zelensky and President Trump, who has said [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=113.86s)]
*  he doesn't want to send U.S. peacekeeping troops to Ukraine as a backstop to that deal. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=119.14s)]
*  He wants Europe to do it instead. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=125.9s)]
*  And so you can question the wisdom and the strategy of Zelensky bringing up that point [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=128.3s)]
*  of difference repeatedly in the Oval Office, something that any student of President Trump [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=135.46s)]
*  and his negotiating style over the past decade or so would know would probably tick him off. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=142.66s)]
*  But regardless, Zelensky probably also didn't anticipate that he was going to be spending [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=150.22s)]
*  an hour negotiating out in the open in front of the cameras. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=154.82s)]
*  And so things did take a pretty precipitous turn south. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=158.38s)]
*  Zelensky, after about five minutes of pretty heated back and forth with President Trump [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=165.1s)]
*  and Vice President Vance, was shown the door. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=170.34s)]
*  He was not allowed to sign this minerals deal. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=172.38s)]
*  There was the whole reason that he had come to the White House from Ukraine in the first [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=175.5s)]
*  place. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=180.02s)]
*  And now the Ukrainians, the Europeans, the Americans are all trying to figure out where [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=181.02s)]
*  things go from here. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=187.58s)]
*  And we're told that that will be the main topic of discussion at a meeting here at the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=189.36s)]
*  White House a little later between the president and his national security team. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=194.22s)]
*  One last question before we talk about the first address to Congress that he is doing [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=199.58s)]
*  tomorrow. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=203.54s)]
*  The president is, Nancy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=204.54s)]
*  We saw over the weekend a flurry of activity in Europe with President Zelensky meeting [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=205.7s)]
*  with European leaders. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=209.18s)]
*  President Zelensky also met with King Charles in an unprecedented show of solidarity, where [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  the king invited him to his private estate at Sandringham, which rarely, rarely happens. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=216.46s)]
*  He does the king, and before him the queen did state visits. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=220.38s)]
*  This was sort of unique, showing Zelensky shaking hands with Britain's monarch and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=224.06s)]
*  then also with Keir Starmer, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, and other European [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=229.3s)]
*  leaders who quickly put out statements in support. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=233.98000000000002s)]
*  Is the White House worried that if, for sure, the notion that Europeans perhaps foot more [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=237.46s)]
*  of the bill with regards to what is happening on the continent being a point that a lot [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=243.10000000000002s)]
*  of Americans can get behind, but also where we all of a sudden see our allies not seeing [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  us as a reliable partner going forward? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=252.86s)]
*  Is that a concern for them? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=255.86s)]
*  I think it is a concern in the sense that President Trump wants to be the dealmaker [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=258.42s)]
*  here. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=264.7s)]
*  He truly believes that he is the only person who can get Vladimir Putin to the negotiating [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=265.7s)]
*  table to try to hammer out some kind of peace. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=271.82s)]
*  That doesn't mean that they think that they will, for sure, be successful, but they think [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=276.06s)]
*  that the Trump-Putin relationship, whatever you make of it, puts Trump in a unique position [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=280.26s)]
*  to try to broker this deal. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=286.14s)]
*  And so, you know, they see what's happened in Europe over the weekend. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=288.62s)]
*  They see European leaders stepping up, showing support for Zelensky, regrouping, trying to [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=293.46s)]
*  figure out, OK, do we need to go it alone here? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=298.53999999999996s)]
*  Do we need to try to figure out how to deal with Putin if the U.S. is going to pull back [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=301.29999999999995s)]
*  or be erratic? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=308.18s)]
*  And so I think that all of that is going to inform President Trump's meeting with his [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=310.38s)]
*  national security advisers today because this is an issue that President Trump seems to [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=315.58s)]
*  want to be front and center on. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=322.46s)]
*  And Nancy, quickly, before we go, 30 seconds, what can we preview for tomorrow's speech [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=325.5s)]
*  to Congress? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=329.41999999999996s)]
*  Well, we're still waiting for an official preview, but I think knowing that the topics [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=330.41999999999996s)]
*  that President Trump likes to talk about, I anticipate we'll hear a lot about immigration [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=335.26s)]
*  and the bill he's trying to push through Congress right now. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=338.90000000000003s)]
*  We'll hear a lot about reducing taxes, and we'll also hear a lot about government efficiency [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=341.62s)]
*  and doge as he tries to make the case to the American people that these cuts that he has [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=347.14s)]
*  been imposing are a good thing. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=351.74s)]
*  Nancy Korda's always breaking it down like only she can. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=354.42s)]
*  Thank you, Nancy. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=357.22s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=358.22s)]
*  You got it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=359.22s)]
*  All right, let's bring in CBS News foreign correspondent, Rami Nissencio. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=360.22s)]
*  Rami's joining me live from London to talk more about this. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=364.38s)]
*  So as you heard me explaining to Nancy, Rami, these European leaders that are embracing [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=365.54s)]
*  Zelensky—she gave me the White House perspective. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=371.54s)]
*  I'm curious what you're hearing from the Europeans, this show of solidarity. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=374.26s)]
*  A lot of Americans would say, great, those statements are fine. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=377.65999999999997s)]
*  Put your money where your mouth is. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=381.94s)]
*  Start footing a greater share of the bill, because the United States and its people are [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=383.82s)]
*  tired of doing so. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=388.74s)]
*  What are you hearing about that? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=389.74s)]
*  Absolutely, Vlad. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=390.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=391.74s)]
*  Absolutely, it's a circling of the wagons from British and European leaders all throughout [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=393.1s)]
*  this weekend. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=398.26s)]
*  Yesterday, it was this summit of securing our future. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=399.26s)]
*  That was the title of the summit, which really turned into this kind of crisis talk mode [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=403.38s)]
*  after that massive blowup at the White House between Trump and Zelensky on Friday. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=407.88s)]
*  But the leaders who did come out to speak with us at the press gaggle after that, yesterday [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=412.1s)]
*  They basically admitted and said that Europe needs to correct what Ursula von der Leyen, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=418.58s)]
*  the EU president, said was an historic underinvestment in the defense of Europe. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=426.41999999999996s)]
*  We also saw other leaders come out basically echoing what she—what her sentiment was [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=433.18s)]
*  in that with the potential that the Trump White House might pull support for Ukraine [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=439.38s)]
*  and potentially Europe, they all had to ante up pushing ahead here. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=446.62s)]
*  We are looking ahead to what's happening a couple days from now. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=452.53999999999996s)]
*  March 6th, on Thursday, there's another EU leaders summit where we expect a defense package [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=456.34s)]
*  to be announced by EU leaders in Brussels. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=462.14s)]
*  That is for all of the EU, but also inclusive of that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=466.38s)]
*  Ukraine and defense budget for Ukraine. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=470.65999999999997s)]
*  Unknown though, Vlad, right now is what kind of assistance, how much assistance, what weapons, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=473.46s)]
*  if any, and really even if it's going to be enough to counter Russia if this war continues [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=478.5s)]
*  to drag on after the past three years. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=484.29999999999995s)]
*  And there's another if, if the US does pull its support from its historic allies. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=486.14s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, and I get what Nancy was saying, that the president of the United States would [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=491.06s)]
*  like to be seen as bringing peace to the region, but the concern I think that these European [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=494.97999999999996s)]
*  leaders have is they know Vladimir Putin very well. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=499.41999999999996s)]
*  Putin can agree to anything he has in the past agreed to whatever it is that he thinks [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=502.58s)]
*  will get his country out from crushing sanctions, will get him invited back to the G8 summits. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=506.94s)]
*  But then a year, two years later, reneges on the deals that he's agreed to. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=513.06s)]
*  And that is the concern for the Europeans, which is that he may say yes now and completely [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=517.98s)]
*  act in the opposite fashion down the line. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=523.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=525.66s)]
*  We're talking about the Minsk deal comes to mind with regards to Ukraine. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=526.66s)]
*  And the idea there was that Russia would not go back into Ukraine. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=532.0600000000001s)]
*  And here now, roughly 20 percent of Ukraine has been taken over and is now controlled [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=537.2600000000001s)]
*  by Russia. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=542.7800000000001s)]
*  But in regards to what is what are some takeaways from the summit from yesterday, we are seeing [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=543.7800000000001s)]
*  a couple things trickle in. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=549.86s)]
*  First off, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called it a coalition of the willing, the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=551.34s)]
*  people you're seeing at the table, the leaders you're seeing at the table, some of them, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=556.98s)]
*  many of them are expected to be part of that coalition. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=559.78s)]
*  We do not know yet who will be among them. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=562.9599999999999s)]
*  Mr. Starmer said that he's going to leave it to those individual governments. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=566.3399999999999s)]
*  But he did basically put the UK first and foremost being an example of what they could [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=569.3199999999999s)]
*  do. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=575.4599999999999s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=576.4599999999999s)]
*  The UK is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air, together [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=577.4599999999999s)]
*  with others. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=583.28s)]
*  Europe must do the heavy listing. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=585.12s)]
*  But to support peace in our continent and to succeed, this effort must have strong U.S. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=588.38s)]
*  backing. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=595.8s)]
*  And just one of the takeaways out of that, he also declared a two billion dollar deal, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=597.4s)]
*  one point six billion pounds for Ukraine to buy something like five thousand air defense [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=602.4s)]
*  missiles. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=607.72s)]
*  We're seeing aerospace stocks jump on the news here in the United Kingdom and also out [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=608.72s)]
*  of Germany, some media reports saying that they're now talking about two funds, one [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=612.68s)]
*  for defense and one for aerospace, potentially more than four hundred billion dollars. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=617.1999999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=620.92s)]
*  You know, it's fascinating, Rami, before you go. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=621.92s)]
*  It strikes me that Keir Starmer is, it's been how many years now since Brexit and now [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=624.6999999999999s)]
*  the United Kingdom taking the lead on continental matters. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=628.7199999999999s)]
*  It's just sort of remarkable to me that this is happening in the here and now, given that [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=634.12s)]
*  the UK left the European Union some years ago. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=638.04s)]
*  Rami Nissencio reporting from London for us this morning. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=640.84s)]
*  Rami, as always, your insight analysis. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=643.5600000000001s)]
*  Excellent. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=645.76s)]
*  Thank you, my friend. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=646.76s)]
*  Good. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpFCNSg6DA&t=647.76s)]
