# Hegseth says it's "unrealistic" for Ukraine to return to its pre-2014 borders
**CBS News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI)
*  A barrage of Russian missiles and drones struck the Ukrainian capital of Kiev overnight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=0.0s)]
*  At least one person was killed and four others were injured in the northern part of the country. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=4.28s)]
*  Two others were injured in a Russian attack targeting critical infrastructure, according [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=11.28s)]
*  to officials. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=15.48s)]
*  The country's air force says it was able to shoot down most of those missiles and drones. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=16.48s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addressed the Ukrainian defense contact group this morning [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=21.04s)]
*  in Brussels. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=25.2s)]
*  In his remarks, he signaled a shift in just how far the U.S. is willing to go in its support [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=26.2s)]
*  of Ukraine. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=30.0s)]
*  We will only end this devastating war and establish a durable peace by coupling allied [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=31.0s)]
*  strength with a realistic assessment of the battlefield. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=38.12s)]
*  We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=44.32s)]
*  But we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=50.64s)]
*  objective. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=57.76s)]
*  CBS News' senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams is monitoring all of this from London. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  So Holly, what is the reaction in Europe from NATO, from others, from the Ukrainians about [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=64.64s)]
*  what Secretary Hegseth is saying, that the sovereign borders of Ukraine may not look [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=71.12s)]
*  before the invasion by the Russians? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=78.26s)]
*  Good morning, Vlad. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=81.26s)]
*  Well, there was quite a lot of meat to what the Secretary of Defense said. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=82.26s)]
*  He said, quote, the bloodshed must stop. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=86.14s)]
*  This war must end. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=88.42s)]
*  Now, that's not surprising. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=89.42s)]
*  We know that President Trump wants to end the war in Ukraine. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=90.78s)]
*  He said he wants a sovereign Ukraine, or the U.S. wants a sovereign Ukraine. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=93.78s)]
*  That is an independent Ukraine. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=97.28s)]
*  But as you just heard, he said a return to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is unrealistic. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=99.26s)]
*  Now remember, the first time that Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine was back in 2014, when [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=104.42s)]
*  he annexed Crimea and began backing separatists in Ukraine's east, who seized territory [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=109.18s)]
*  there. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=115.26s)]
*  Now, that statement from the Secretary of Defense suggests that the U.S. supports some [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=116.26s)]
*  or all of that territory becoming Russian territory permanently. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=120.98s)]
*  And there was another important qualification as well. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=125.9s)]
*  Hegseth said that the U.S. supports robust security guarantees to stop Russia from reinvading [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=128.7s)]
*  Ukraine but does not support NATO membership for Ukraine, which would potentially commit [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=133.94s)]
*  the U.S. to coming to Ukraine's defense if it's attacked again. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=139.82s)]
*  And he said that U.S. troops would not be part of any international peacekeeping force [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=143.9s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=148.78s)]
*  The overarching message of what he said was that the U.S. is committed to NATO and is [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=149.9s)]
*  committed to its European partners. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=154.57999999999998s)]
*  But he said that the U.S.'s primary focus is at home and in the Pacific, where it's [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=156.86s)]
*  trying to deter a conflict with China. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=162.66000000000003s)]
*  And he said that he wants Europe to do more to guarantee its own security. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=165.22s)]
*  So Holly, if you're Ukrainian and you're listening to these comments, essentially it sounds like [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=170.62s)]
*  what the president through the Secretary of Defense is saying is, OK, for Russia's illegal [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=175.70000000000002s)]
*  actions they get to keep a portion of Ukraine. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=181.10000000000002s)]
*  The United States isn't going to do anything about that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  By not allowing Ukraine to join NATO and also by not being part of a peacekeeping mission, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=187.42s)]
*  what's to prevent Vladimir Putin from doing it again, given that he will have kept the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=193.26s)]
*  spoils of war? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=197.5s)]
*  So are you hearing at all any reaction from Kiev? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=198.5s)]
*  Look, there hasn't been any official response that I'm aware of, but we've had a new interview [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=201.34s)]
*  with Vladimir Zelensky in the U.K.'s Guardian newspaper. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=206.26s)]
*  He said that any security guarantees need U.S. involvement because he said that Europe [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=209.7s)]
*  cannot do it by himself. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=214.42s)]
*  Zelensky has long wanted NATO membership for Ukraine. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=216.22s)]
*  That's exactly the opposite of what the Secretary of Defense said today. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=219.1s)]
*  And when it comes to those pre-2014 borders, we know that Ukraine envisages doing some [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=223.26000000000002s)]
*  kind of land swap as part of a ceasefire deal, handing over territory that it has seized [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=228.22s)]
*  in Russia in return for its own territory coming home. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=232.74s)]
*  Whether or not it's willing to give up on Crimea, for instance, we don't know at this [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=236.74s)]
*  point. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=240.62s)]
*  Also in that interview, very interestingly, Zelensky seemed to be playing to President [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=241.70000000000002s)]
*  Trump the businessman, talking about offering U.S. companies lucrative reconstruction contracts, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=245.66s)]
*  access to Ukrainian rare earth and investment concessions. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=251.34s)]
*  So seeming to offer Trump a kind of quid pro quo in return for U.S. protection. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=255.74s)]
*  Historically, we know that he loves those. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=262.5s)]
*  Holly Williams, with that really important reporting for us this morning. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=264.74s)]
*  Holly, you've been covering that conflict since 2014 and even before. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=268.7s)]
*  Thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLKc7cRebI&t=272.34s)]
