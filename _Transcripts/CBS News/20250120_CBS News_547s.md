# Biden departs Washington after Trump's inauguration
**CBS News:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck)
*  And it should be noted, too, the ages of both of these presidents. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=0.0s)]
*  True. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=4.84s)]
*  Donald Trump, 78 years old, now becomes the oldest president elected at age 78 and will [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=5.84s)]
*  serve into his 80s as well, as well as Joe Biden, who is now 82 years old, just having [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=12.52s)]
*  had his birthday in November. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=20.88s)]
*  He will now join what is now Special Air Mission 46. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=24.28s)]
*  It's only called Marine One when the president of the United States is on it for that final [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=29.76s)]
*  flyover of our majestic United States Capitol to see those final moments. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=35.400000000000006s)]
*  And while there has been much accomplished in the Biden administration, even though the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=44.24s)]
*  American people did not view that so, there were 17 million jobs created. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=48.160000000000004s)]
*  And he's certainly digging the country out of massive inflation that some say he helped [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=53.8s)]
*  with some of his big spending programs. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=57.28s)]
*  There is much that those within the Biden circle hope that the long lens of history [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=60.92s)]
*  will show that he has achieved more than people give him credit for. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=65.36s)]
*  In one of his last interviews, Norah, he was saying he should have done a better job on [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  messaging, letting people know all of the things that he had done and that he accomplished. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=73.24s)]
*  Every president says that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=77.84s)]
*  It's a kind of standard button they push. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=80.28s)]
*  You know, some of that might be true if every voter had a had metaphysical certainty about [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=82.96s)]
*  the things done in your White House. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  But also, it's very true in American politics and very hard that when the economy is against [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=91.52s)]
*  you, you can't talk your way around that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=96.08s)]
*  And there was always two thirds of the country thought we were headed in the wrong direction. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=99.24s)]
*  But to Gail's point, too, I do think that the Biden administration suffered from an [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  ability to communicate their achievements, not only from the principal level, but also [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=107.92s)]
*  from the staff level. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=112.92s)]
*  So what will he do now? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  He's going to California. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  What will he do now? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=118.56s)]
*  Delaware has always been home for former President Biden, and he will return to Delaware. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=120.76s)]
*  Loves Rehoboth Beach. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=127.56s)]
*  It's a place where he made that decision to exit the presidential race. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=128.56s)]
*  He'll also spend time in Wilmington, I'm told. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=132.8s)]
*  He has a lot of connections in Philadelphia nearby. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=135.92s)]
*  Family lives in the Philadelphia area. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=139.88s)]
*  So he'll be in and around Delaware and Philadelphia, and will surely make his way from time to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=142.14s)]
*  time back to Washington, D.C. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  What a political life for President Biden. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=150.04s)]
*  People close to both President Trump and President Biden have told me that these two men share [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=152.67999999999998s)]
*  a lot more in common than might be fully understood. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=156.2s)]
*  They have both been on the public stage since the 1970s. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=159.67999999999998s)]
*  They have been through ups and downs. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=163.44s)]
*  They are at their core political survivors. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=166.0s)]
*  And that led, I'm told, to a relatively friendly Oval Office meeting when they met in private. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=169.84s)]
*  There's an understanding that they have both endured, even if they both disagree with each [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=175.8s)]
*  other. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=180.88s)]
*  And that we are just witnessing as the vice president, the former vice president, Kamala [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=181.88s)]
*  Harris's motorcade just left. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=185.32s)]
*  And we are already getting a sense of how things are changing here in Washington and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=188.12s)]
*  around the world. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=191.96s)]
*  And I know you have some new reporting. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  And a historic departure for the first female vice president of the United States, Nora. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=195.48000000000002s)]
*  In terms of what's changing, we're already seeing our Camila Montoya Galvez is confirming [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=199.88s)]
*  through Homeland Security officials that all of the appointments that had been scheduled [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=204.12s)]
*  for interviews, for asylum seekers, those seeking to enter the United States legally [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=208.52s)]
*  through this app that was created by the Biden administration to slow the crowds at the border [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=213.98000000000002s)]
*  and get them in through appointments called CBP-1. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=220.8s)]
*  That's already been just totally taken offline. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=223.92s)]
*  So 30,000 appointments that had been scheduled for migrants to go through and have an actual [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=228.0s)]
*  legal process gone already. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=232.92s)]
*  We are seeing changes in these executive orders that could actually create some questions [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=235.68s)]
*  about how does one legally enter if legal pathways are being shut down. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=242.2s)]
*  This is something Nora that came up at the debate, if you remember, that you and I had [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=245.88s)]
*  with the vice presidential candidates campaign promise once again to do away with some of [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=250.36s)]
*  these things that the Biden administration put in place to deal with what has been a [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=255.44s)]
*  historic hemisphere wide migration crisis with a crush of humanity unseen since World [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=260.76s)]
*  War II. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=266.16s)]
*  So, Margaret, are you saying people that want to enter the country legally can now have [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=267.16s)]
*  lost an avenue to do that? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=271.12s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=272.52s)]
*  Effective now? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=274.16s)]
*  Well, in the view of the Trump administration, they believe that the Biden administration's [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=275.16s)]
*  interpretation of the law was not legal, but they had created this pathway under their [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=278.52000000000004s)]
*  interpretation of regulations. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=283.44s)]
*  Yes, Senator Blunt. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=284.88s)]
*  Well, the traditional avenue for asylum was to go to any American embassy, American consulate, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=286.36s)]
*  ask for asylum there. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=293.36s)]
*  This idea that you can come to the border, say I qualify for asylum and get in is very [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=295.12s)]
*  new. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=300.48s)]
*  And there's a reason that we're walking away from that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=301.72s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=304.56s)]
*  There's also a reason that in every European country with their border problems, that's [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=305.9s)]
*  been a huge issue in every election now for a decade. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=310.85999999999996s)]
*  And we have to do something differently than we're doing. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=314.9s)]
*  What we're doing is not working. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=317.06s)]
*  Great point in terms of not just the hemisphere wide migration crisis, but it's really worldwide. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=320.14s)]
*  You see it through Middle East, through Africa, moving into Europe. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=324.26s)]
*  But in terms of the processing in this day and age, the poverty that exists for some [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=328.26s)]
*  people prevents traveling to the capital to go to an embassy. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=332.26s)]
*  And your work around was create that app on your phone. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=335.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, but living in a poor or dangerous country is not a reason for asylum. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=338.26000000000005s)]
*  You have to personally have some unique fear. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=345.1s)]
*  People all over the world will come to the United States if there's a way to get here [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=348.14000000000004s)]
*  for good reason. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=351.62s)]
*  But you can't let every, we're the most open country in the world on asylum. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=352.62s)]
*  And we have made a joke out of the asylum process by what we've been doing at the border. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=357.70000000000005s)]
*  That would need to change through law or what was just announced in executive order by [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=362.34000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=367.14s)]
*  It's a full conversation to have. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=368.14s)]
*  Yes, it's a full conversation to have about the process and failures of the immigration [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=370.14s)]
*  system that have largely been the product of the United States Congress's failure to [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=373.98s)]
*  get something done for decades. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=378.66s)]
*  Even though multiple presidents, Republican and Democrat, have tried valiantly to do that [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=380.86s)]
*  And now we see the helicopter known as Marine One and the president is in it is now special [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=385.98s)]
*  air mission 47 departing, special mission 46 departing the east front of the capital. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=395.38s)]
*  As Joe Biden leaves Washington for the final time, ending a half century career as a public [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=405.02s)]
*  servant. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=411.94s)]
*  Want to bring in Scott McFarlane, who's there, Scott? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=412.94s)]
*  Standing in the footprint of this helicopter about to take off on the east front of the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=417.7s)]
*  capital, it really is quite a closing chapter to the peaceful transfer of power. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=423.46s)]
*  It was four years ago where the rioters first fought with police in this very spot, disrupting [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=430.98s)]
*  the peaceful transfer of power in twenty twenty one. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=438.02s)]
*  It has been secured here today with President elect Trump, now President Trump, side by [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=441.02000000000004s)]
*  side with President Biden, watching President Biden board the helicopter for this aerial [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=448.26s)]
*  liftoff, this one of a kind American image and moment on the east front of the capital. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=455.34000000000003s)]
*  If you can still hear me, there are police and fire EMS workers surrounding this area [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=462.14000000000004s)]
*  taking pictures on their phones. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=468.42s)]
*  And it feels something akin to a severe thunderstorm or small tornado and wind strength. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=471.74s)]
*  The metaphor of a change in Washington. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=479.18s)]
*  I can't remember the year that I was there in that exact same position. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=486.78s)]
*  And just to think about it, just to think about how President Biden feels at this moment, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=490.5s)]
*  that's what I was wondering, Laura. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=497.9s)]
*  And I wonder, do we know who else is on the helicopter? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=499.17999999999995s)]
*  If anybody who else is on it with him? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=502.34s)]
*  Do we know? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=505.62s)]
*  Dr. Biden. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=506.09999999999997s)]
*  He's about to pass by the old home place, too. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=507.17999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Besides, Joel and Joe Biden, do we know who else could possibly be on that chaser? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=509.41999999999996s)]
*  Because normally it's not just the two of them. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=514.9s)]
*  He's going to look down in his own times. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=517.14s)]

*  I imagine he'll be greeted by the members of his family for that trip out to California [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58UrZa0fck&t=535.0999999999999s)]
