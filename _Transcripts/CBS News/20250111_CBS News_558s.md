# Death toll rises from L.A. area wildfires, officials confirm
**CBS News:** [January 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY)
*  We do want to provide an update for you just into our newsroom. The death toll [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=0.0s)]
*  from these fires now that's up to 16 according to the medical examiner's [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=3.4s)]
*  office. Yeah, we want to bring in Mark Lou Mark. We're just getting this into [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=8.48s)]
*  our newsroom and sadly this is something we have been anticipating. We [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=13.4s)]
*  know the city of Pasadena was using cadaver dogs to go through homes today, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=18.88s)]
*  homes where people had already even said that they had left and are safe. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=22.64s)]
*  They are doing that just to make sure they go through every single property. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=28.32s)]
*  But Mark, I know we're learning a little bit about some of these deaths. Yeah, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=33.68s)]
*  that's exactly right. The Department of Medical Examiner, the L. A County [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  Medical Examiner has just released the most comprehensive report that we have [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=41.2s)]
*  seen so far. And actually, if you can bring it up on my screen, there's a lot [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=45.72s)]
*  of data here that I want to go through. This just came out about a half an hour [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=48.96s)]
*  ago and we've been looking at it. This is from the county of Los Angeles [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=51.88s)]
*  Medical Examiner, the number of deaths and the lists of where they were found [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=55.6s)]
*  and information about those deaths. Now you can see here they're listed here [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=61.04s)]
*  which fire they've it's either the palisades or the eaten fire. Let me see [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=65.0s)]
*  if I can actually get this to be a little bit bigger so that you can read [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=69.12s)]
*  it a little bit better there. I've zoomed in so you can see here there's [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=71.92s)]
*  many, many, many cases. There's 16 all the way down and I'm gonna zoom in and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=75.04s)]
*  show first one here. The palisades from the palisades fire. This person died. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=79.62s)]
*  They say in the hospital, the status pending legal next of kin notification [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=83.92s)]
*  decedent is a man in his eighties. And then on the 3400 block of Monorosa [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  Drive in Alta Dena, the eaten fire, they have identified the body that was found [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  there. I'll show you this one. It is a man named Victor Shaw. They said the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=97.04s)]
*  cause smoke inhalation and thermal injuries of the 16 so far on this list. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=101.2s)]
*  He is the only one that has been identified. There is also a column here [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=106.48s)]
*  right here whether or not these are confirmed human remains. And as I go [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  down this list, you can see the eaten and palisades fire on Alta Pine Drive. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=114.28s)]
*  It is an unidentified body but confirmed to be human remains. Also in [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  the 20,900 block Pacific Coast Highway, unidentified but confirmed to be human [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  remains. There were some remains found here in the eaten fire on West Harris [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=128.12s)]
*  Street 100 block. It says at the Department of Medical Examiner, they have [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=132.2s)]
*  not yet confirmed if that is human remains. And then these two here in the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=136.04000000000002s)]
*  palisades on Roca Chica Drive and Friends Street and Pacific Palisades, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=139.56s)]
*  both confirmed to be human remains but unidentified. And then these three in [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=143.72s)]
*  the eaten fire on Tonya Avenue, two of them on the same block on Tonya Avenue [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=147.72s)]
*  and one on East Los Forest Drive, all confirmed to be human remains as well. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  And then a final one here in Palisades on the 22,100 block of Swenson Drive in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=156.68s)]
*  Topanga, an unidentified body confirmed to be human remains. Now the finals down [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=161.08s)]
*  here, all from the eaten fire on East Sacramento Street, West Terrance Street, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=165.56s)]
*  Crens Avenue, Wappalo Street and Pine Street. These remains are all the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=171.08s)]
*  Department of the Medical Examiner or waiting for a Department of Medical [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=175.56s)]
*  Examiner response to come claim them. They have not been confirmed as human [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=178.84s)]
*  remains but we believe they are suspected as such as these remains were [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=182.28s)]
*  taken to the Department of Medical Examiner. So 16 deaths confirmed so far [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=186.36s)]
*  in both of these fires split between Palisades and eaten and unfortunately [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=191.88000000000002s)]
*  the tragic fact remains is that there continues to be a search with [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=196.60000000000002s)]
*  cadaver dogs through the hundreds even thousands of homes and structures that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=199.96s)]
*  have been destroyed and we may see more of those human remains brought to the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=204.68s)]
*  County Medical Examiner's office in the coming days. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=208.12s)]
*  It's just heartbreaking. It is absolutely heartbreaking, Mark, because out of these [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=211.16000000000003s)]
*  16 people and the ones that we do know have been confirmed [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  human remains, only one died in the hospital. The rest, we don't know their [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=219.16s)]
*  stories and we hope to one day learn all of their stories and all of their names [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=224.76s)]
*  but you know the rest died in their communities when these fires quickly [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=228.92s)]
*  swept through possibly their homes. We don't know if they were leaving but or [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=233.88s)]
*  if they were there or if it was just they were overcome by the the fire [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=240.44s)]
*  rushing through there. It is just absolutely heartbreaking to see that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=245.56s)]
*  the reality of the situation. Yeah it really is. You've made a very [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=249.56s)]
*  important observation that these bodies were all discovered at these [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=253.16s)]
*  locations in these neighborhoods so the remains very likely may be damaged very [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=258.12s)]
*  severely due to the intensity of the fire which means they may need medical [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=263.72s)]
*  records like dental records or DNA in order to identify them which is [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=267.0s)]
*  going to prolong that process. That is going to take it longer to get closure [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=271.56s)]
*  for their families to finally come to the realization that their loved one [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  did pass away in this fire and it's also an unfortunate [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=279.64000000000004s)]
*  it's a case of people who did not evacuate either they [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=283.48s)]
*  chose not to evacuate or they were unable to evacuate because of the speed [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=287.0s)]
*  of the fire and so the Medical Examiner is going to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=290.92s)]
*  continue to work through these coming days and weeks to identify those remains [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=293.96000000000004s)]
*  very likely through dental records if they're available or DNA if the family [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=298.36s)]
*  is is able to provide that information as well. Yeah a lot of work still to do [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=302.2s)]
*  and and just unbelievably tragic on top of that. Worth [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=305.64s)]
*  letting you know one more time 16 deaths in these SoCal fires we're [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  learning this evening 11 from the Eaton fire, five from the Palisades fire so far. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  Let's get to KCal News reporter Laurie Perez now live in Pacific Palisades [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=317.48s)]
*  tonight. And Laurie we have to ask what is the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=321.16s)]
*  latest there but I know you yourself you've been covering [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=323.88s)]
*  the Palisades fire from the very beginning and to hear [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=326.68s)]
*  those numbers just continue to rise I know even as someone that's been in [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=330.04s)]
*  those communities it's just a a heart-wrenching number. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=333.56s)]
*  It is and I was trying not to think about that right before the live shot [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=341.24s)]
*  but it is I mean I was going to say before I begin [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=345.16s)]
*  what I'm going to talk about here is that you know we go through these [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=347.56s)]
*  communities every day and we cover stories with people [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=350.36s)]
*  good and bad stories and they become you know our community they are our [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=354.28s)]
*  community and they become friends and they become sources [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=359.0s)]
*  and it's heartbreaking to think of all of the people who have been affected but [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=361.79999999999995s)]
*  especially hearing that death hole rise is very [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=365.64s)]
*  difficult to hear. But I want to tell you that we are here on Sunset Boulevard [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=368.84s)]
*  not far from the Riviera Country Club this is an area that is under evacuation [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=373.64s)]
*  orders and we are here not because there's [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=378.11999999999995s)]
*  necessarily any flames around here but the cell phone signals the signals [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=380.44s)]
*  are very difficult all throughout Los Angeles County now [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=384.2s)]
*  and this is the closest area that we could get to get up on tv [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=387.8s)]
*  we just came down from Mandeville Canyon [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=391.47999999999996s)]
*  where there are active flames as we speak that's about a mile [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=394.68s)]
*  away we do have some video to show you on Mandeville Canyon Road [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=398.92s)]
*  all the way up in Mandeville Canyon Road to the top there are dozens of [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=402.76s)]
*  firefighters and dozens of fire engines positioned all the way up and down that [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=406.59999999999997s)]
*  is because the fire has been coming down the hillsides at points we saw flames [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=412.2s)]
*  a few yards away from the streets a few yards away from the back of homes [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=417.64s)]
*  with ground crews actively watching and working to suppress them [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=422.2s)]
*  and they are getting lots of help from above [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=426.68s)]
*  which is much of Mandeville Canyon Road is doused in that bright red [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=429.88s)]
*  and pink fire retardant that we're so familiar with [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=435.72s)]
*  houses and cars and yards just covered with that stuff [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=439.32s)]
*  looking you know I thought something like something out of Willy Wonka but [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=443.56s)]
*  gratefully so no doubt that retardant doesn't extinguish the flames but it [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=447.48s)]
*  certainly does stop them in their tracks slows them [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=452.76s)]
*  down in their tracks so that crews do have the opportunity [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=456.6s)]
*  to attack them with water and other things and we saw air support in fact [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=459.96s)]
*  following with water drops there is a lot that can go up [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=464.44s)]
*  at that canyon along with the homes it is a beloved area [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=468.36s)]
*  of wooded areas you know I mean they love to live up in that canyon because [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=472.36s)]
*  of all of the brush and trees and nature around [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=476.76s)]
*  but that of course is ripe to burn and there are unfortunately [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=480.12s)]
*  a good number of eucalyptus trees which we also noticed [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=485.0s)]
*  which of course are highly flammable we spoke with a homeowner [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=488.68s)]
*  who said that he helped a firefighter to try and put out some of the flames [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=492.44s)]
*  around his neighbor's eucalyptus trees he told us he has lived in that canyon [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=496.68s)]
*  for more than 60 years and says he's been amazed this time around by the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=500.84000000000003s)]
*  number of crews on the ground and in the air [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=505.8s)]
*  who are helping mandevil canyon he feels as if they are keeping it [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=508.84000000000003s)]
*  under control but certainly knows from 60 years of fire [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6q6CkgALY&t=512.92s)]
