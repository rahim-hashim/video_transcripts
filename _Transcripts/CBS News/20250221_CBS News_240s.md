# Netanyahu vows to make Hamas pay for not returning body of Israeli hostage Shiri Bibas
**CBS News:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0)
*  We begin with developments out of the Middle East this morning, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=0.0s)]
*  where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing to make Hamas pay [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=3.0s)]
*  for failing to return the body of deceased Israeli hostage Shiri Bebas as agreed. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=8.0s)]
*  Yesterday, the militant group handed over the bodies of four Israeli hostages, as we reported, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=13.0s)]
*  said to be Shiri and her two young children, Ariel and Kefir, as well as Oded Lifshitz. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=18.0s)]
*  But overnight, Israel's defense forces announced one of the bodies received was not Shiri Bebas. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=24.0s)]
*  Responding this morning, Hamas claimed Shiri's remains appear to have been mixed up with that of another person. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=30.0s)]
*  Joining us now for more on this from Jerusalem is CBS News contributor Robert Berger. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=37.0s)]
*  Robert, what impact could this horrific mix-up have on the Gaza ceasefire? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=41.0s)]
*  Well, there's a sense of outrage here. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=48.0s)]
*  You know, Israelis waking up to this news. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=50.0s)]
*  Yesterday, it was a sad day when Shiri Bebas and the two youngest hostages' bodies were returned home. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=53.0s)]
*  And then today, it turns out that it wasn't her at all. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=60.0s)]
*  As you mentioned, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is saying it's a cynical violation of the ceasefire and vowing revenge. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=63.0s)]
*  But having said that, I don't think Israel wants to blow up this peace deal or this hostage deal. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=71.0s)]
*  So tomorrow, we're expecting the release of six living hostages. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=78.0s)]
*  Nobody wants that to be thwarted. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=83.0s)]
*  So I think the Israelis are angry. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=86.0s)]
*  They, as I said, Netanyahu vowing revenge. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=89.0s)]
*  But on the other hand, they want to keep that hostage release tomorrow, six hostages in place. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=93.0s)]
*  Also, we're expecting the release of another four dead hostages next week, which would wind up Phase One. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=98.0s)]
*  So the hope is to keep that on track despite what happened. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=105.0s)]
*  And meantime, Robert Netanyahu has ordered Israel's military to carry out a, quote, intensive operation over in the West Bank. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=109.0s)]
*  And that followed explosions on buses last night near Tel Aviv. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=117.0s)]
*  Tell us what's happening on that front. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=121.0s)]
*  Yeah, a scary night last night in Tel Aviv. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=123.0s)]
*  Around 10 p.m., there were explosions that blew up three empty buses. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=126.0s)]
*  No injuries. But the explosions rattled areas around Tel Aviv. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=131.0s)]
*  And then they discovered two more bombs on other buses near Tel Aviv. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=139.0s)]
*  And according to police, the plan was to blow these buses up simultaneously today during morning rush hour. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=144.0s)]
*  Could have been really a catastrophic terrorist attack. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=151.0s)]
*  Reminiscent of the first Palestinian uprising back from 2000 and 2004. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=155.0s)]
*  We used to see those fairly often. Hardly see those anymore. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=162.0s)]
*  But really a close call there. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=166.0s)]
*  Apparently, it was something went wrong with the timers on the bomb and they went off early. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=169.0s)]
*  Just stunning to hear your reporting on that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=174.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Arab leaders, they're meeting in Saudi Arabia today to discuss the future of Gaza. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=177.0s)]
*  What exactly are they proposing? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=182.0s)]
*  Well, of course, this comes against the background of President Trump's very controversial proposal to move two million Palestinians out of Gaza and complete and create a so-called Riviera in the Middle East. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=184.0s)]
*  The Arab states obviously opposed to this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=199.0s)]
*  All of them because and especially Egypt and Jordan, because the president was hoping that they would take in hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=203.0s)]
*  They've refused. So we're seeing Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states meeting today in Saudi Arabia to try and come up with an alternative plan. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=214.0s)]
*  In short, it would call for the rebuilding of Gaza while Palestinians in Gaza are able to remain on their own land. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=224.0s)]
*  All right, Robert Berger joining us from Jerusalem just past two in the afternoon there, Robert. Thank you. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AICjxa1q4I0&t=235.0s)]
