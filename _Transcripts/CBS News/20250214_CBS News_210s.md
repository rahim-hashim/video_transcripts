# Federal prosecutors move to drop case against Eric Adams amid flurry of DOJ resignations
**CBS News:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8)
*  Hello and thanks so much for watching. We begin this hour with the continued [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=0.0s)]
*  fallout at the Department of Justice. Federal prosecutors have now moved to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=4.2s)]
*  drop the criminal corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=8.8s)]
*  It comes after released seven top officials at the D. O. J. Resigned over [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=13.72s)]
*  an order from Deputy Attorney General Emil both earlier this week, signaling [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=18.46s)]
*  the department was seeking to have the case come to an end. Federal agencies [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=23.12s)]
*  have also started mass layoffs of probationary employees at the directive [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=27.16s)]
*  of President Donald Trump. So far, several agencies have been impacted, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=31.88s)]
*  including the Departments of Education, Veterans Affairs, Energy and the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=36.16s)]
*  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. CBS News Justice Department reporter [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=40.56s)]
*  Jake Rosen joins me now for more on all this. Jake, let's start with Mayor Eric [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=45.16s)]
*  Adams. Federal bribery case at the D. O. J. We know made a big move late [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=49.8s)]
*  Friday. So what happens next year? Well, now that this turmoil has come to at [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=54.28s)]
*  least a temporary pause after these rounds of resignations and a couple of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=58.6s)]
*  days of the Justice Department basically holding over federal prosecutors who [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  work in the Southern District of New York, whether or not one of them who's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=66.8s)]
*  actually in the department would actually file this, a judge now has the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=70.52000000000001s)]
*  opportunity to potentially pause if they see issue with this deal that the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=74.04s)]
*  Department of Justice has made with New York City Mayor Adams to potentially [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=78.2s)]
*  pause this for now, but really not a lot of power. It seems very likely that this [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=81.72000000000001s)]
*  judge will have to approve this, which again pauses the charges against Eric [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  Adams without prejudice until after the November 2025 mayor election, which [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=90.04s)]
*  Adams said this morning on Fox News, he still plans on running in and then the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=94.92s)]
*  Department of Justice can go from there. If they see that he's fit and approved [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=98.92000000000002s)]
*  of and worked with them on the immigration reform that they want to see [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=103.12s)]
*  done in New York, then it's very likely these charges go away forever. And if [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  for some reason he speaks up again against the Trump administration, it's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=109.48s)]
*  possible that these charges come back. Jake, we've seen seven DOJ officials so [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  far leaving over this. Explain why and whether you expect more. Well, really [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=116.12s)]
*  just the decision flatly, as Emil Boeve put it, to drop these charges for not a [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  matter of the prosecution or a fact in the case or whether or not the government [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=127.4s)]
*  would find success, but for political reasons, which was agreeing with the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  administration's moves on immigration, helping the Trump administration and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=136.16s)]
*  federal agencies like ICE work on immigration raids in New York City. He [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=139.76s)]
*  has fully bowed down to them and allowed them into the city to kind of at least [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=144.4s)]
*  get going on these mass deportations that the Trump administration wants [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=149.12s)]
*  because he has signaled that the Trump administration and Trump DOJ now [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  signaled that they're obviously going to drop these cases. There was also a key [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=156.64s)]
*  hearing that happened today. I want to ask you about eight federal watchdogs [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=160.76s)]
*  who were abruptly fired last month by President Trump are now suing to get [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=164.76s)]
*  their jobs back. So what's the latest in that legal battle? Well, these eight [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  inspector generals who were fired from across all the government a couple of [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=172.48s)]
*  weeks ago filed a suit and their attorneys asked for a emergency hearing [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=175.88s)]
*  today to go over the facts in the case and potentially have the judge make a [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=179.48s)]
*  motion to put either reinstall these people back in their jobs or to not. And [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=184.28s)]
*  the judge decided to not do it, saying that the inspector general and their [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=188.2s)]
*  attorneys waited too long. She kind of eviscerated the attorneys on the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=191.28s)]
*  plaintiff's side, saying that they simply waited too long and asked for too [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=195.3s)]
*  late after for some kind of emergency relief. We'll see what comes next in [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=198.96s)]
*  that case. But again, it's just one case of many of these federal firings that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=203.22s)]
*  we've seen across the government. Okay, Jake Rosen, thank you. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_xDSCU6o8&t=206.58s)]
