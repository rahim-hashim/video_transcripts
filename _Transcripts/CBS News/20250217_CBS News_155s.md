# IRS reportedly planning to give DOGE staffer access to sensitive taxpayer data
**CBS News:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE)
*  All right, the New York Times reports that the IRS is planning to give a team member of Doge access to sensitive taxpayer data [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=0.0s)]
*  The service is also facing layoffs of probationary workers right in the middle of tax season as Doge continues to trim down [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=7.32s)]
*  Or at least attempt to trim down the federal government. I want to bring in CBS News White House reporter, Aaron Navarro, Aaron [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=13.32s)]
*  I just wonder what Americans are thinking as they're preparing to file their tax returns and they're hearing that those people [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=21.96s)]
*  Who are responsible for collecting those returns and the data associated with them may be fired [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=28.28s)]
*  I mean are we potentially talking about I? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  Can just envision a world where people choose not to file their taxes because there's nobody there and what that means ultimately for the US economy [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=37.24s)]
*  Vlad the IRS is one of those agencies [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=45.52s)]
*  We're watching to see if there are any cuts CBS News learned last week that around Thursday that [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=47.64s)]
*  Doge Staffer was at the IRS and obviously you mentioned the reports [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=53.44s)]
*  This morning about wanting to gain access to what's known as the integrated data retrieval system the ID RS [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=57.5s)]
*  Which essentially houses a lot of personal taxpayer information and reaction to the news. You've seen watched our groups [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=63.78s)]
*  Voice a lot of concerns with whether their personal data the personal data of taxpayers people filing their returns could potentially [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=71.10000000000001s)]
*  Get out there in some way just given the kind of lack of guardrails potentially for a Doge Staffer [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=77.86s)]
*  The White House has told outlets that this Doge Staffer was granted or was acting quote legally and with the appropriate security [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=83.58s)]
*  Clearances when officials are posted to quote the hysteria surrounding [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=91.1s)]
*  Doge's access to data is akin to a patient crying foul when a doctor asks for their medical history [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=94.9s)]
*  So they're downplaying this but certainly watched our groups are voicing a lot of concerns about the potential access that they could get to the IRS [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=100.58s)]
*  And what could be next in the line of sight for Doge? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=108.06s)]
*  We're obviously watching the IRS and it's important to note a lot of health agencies saw steep cuts for what are known as [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=112.06s)]
*  Probationary employees. These are federal government workers that came in maybe within the last year or so [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=120.02000000000001s)]
*  We saw steep cuts at CMS NIH [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=125.16s)]
*  CDC quote disease detectives were cut as well as well as some at the HHS a White House spokesperson said that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=128.38s)]
*  Scientists at CDC and FDA were not part of the cuts and we'll be watching the Department of Education as well [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  We started to see some of those cuts last week and we've heard President Trump talk about how he wants to shut down [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=141.60000000000002s)]
*  That agency that seems to be next in terms of the steeper cuts this upcoming week. All right, Aaron. Thank you very much [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBRQST9ImE&t=147.72000000000003s)]
