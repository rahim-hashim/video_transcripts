*  Well, I think Leslie said I don't think they've been in the same room together. I [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=32.76s)]
*  Mean Robert you've done so much reporting about that relationship not to diverge from the story of the day [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=38.32s)]
*  but but they did just shake hands and for [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=43.24s)]
*  President-elect Trump and for former vice president Pence a moment where they could come together as two people who serve this country [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=47.56s)]
*  There's former president [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=53.78s)]
*  Barack Obama. They did not have a long exchange clearly Trump and Pence [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=55.260000000000005s)]
*  But there was a thaw in there and that exchange and that handshake who knows where it leads or what it means [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=60.260000000000005s)]

*  2021 but this is January of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=74.98s)]
*  2025 and Bob interesting to see Al Gore former vice president right next to Mike Pence two vice presidents who found some [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=76.98s)]
*  ground despite party difference having both presided over the certification of elections they lost [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=84.53999999999999s)]

*  Everyone was bewildered in the Democratic Party by Trump's election. There's former president George W. Bush [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=121.08s)]

*  former first lady Laura Bush [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=133.62s)]
*  But this is the way it's supposed to be [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=136.57999999999998s)]
*  This is the way [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=140.1s)]
*  America [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=142.82s)]
*  operates [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=144.1s)]
*  one president selected and then another and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=145.62s)]

*  The trumps there and as was said while Jimmy Carter politically didn't care for [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=159.34s)]
*  Donald Trump they did have a little bit of a personal [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=165.44s)]
*  relationship of talking about issues of the world from time to time and once [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=170.32s)]
*  President Trump visited with Carter in New York and look how appropriately [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=175.64s)]
*  former president George W. Bush stands to welcome the former first lady Hillary Clinton and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  President Clinton [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=185.88s)]
*  We have not seen President Bush interact with President Trump [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=188.24s)]
*  We have not and we can see other members of the presidential family I see Chelsea Clinton [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=192.48s)]
*  Sitting next to some of the Biden family back there some of those faces you may not recognize our Secret Service agents [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=199.28s)]
*  That are sitting very close because this is [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  National security event the one behind [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  President-elect Trump was famously behind [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=211.83999999999997s)]
*  President-elect Trump during the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. I do want to mention Margaret too [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=214.92s)]
*  We're looking at our former president's United States, but there are world dignitaries here as well [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=221.52s)]
*  Duke of Edinburgh Prince Edward sitting next to Justin Trudeau. There are world [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=226.24s)]
*  The dignitaries here to pay their tribute as well. That's right. The recently resigned Prime Minister of Canada. Justin Trudeau is there [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=231.28s)]
*  Right behind him. I saw earlier the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Gordon Brown as well. There are ambassadors representing their countries [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=238.84s)]
*  In circling that entire area, I think I saw the Korean ambassador the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=246.72s)]
*  Monogasc ambassador so it is really paying tribute to the United States to the passing of a commander-in-chief [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=252.56s)]
*  Countries that may not have been in the forefront of a diplomatic breakthrough. I haven't yet seen Middle East ambassadors there [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=260.88s)]
*  I've seen mainly European and Asian but you know, his legacy was was pretty significant [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=268.48s)]
*  We talked a bit about the Middle East but also in Asia [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=275.04s)]
*  He built upon what Richard Nixon had done with that breakthrough with China and helped to normalize [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=277.96s)]
*  diplomatic relations with the People's Republic after 30 odd years of refusal [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=283.88s)]
*  to note too [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=290.44s)]
*  He did press hard on the issue of Palestinian statehood [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=291.96s)]
*  He did indeed he did and it was you know [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=296.76s)]
*  I was rereading with this book Peace Process that his Mideast advisor wrote and the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  Recounting of being in the room and pressing Menachem Begin to make some really hard calls here [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  Things that he said I'll go public and say the Israelis wouldn't agree to this and if you don't agree [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=312.24s)]
*  We'll end here. We've heard so many times a story about him calling on [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=318.48s)]
*  The soul morality and responsibility to the future generations presenting those photos of the grandchildren [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=323.92s)]
*  But there were some hard moments, too. There were some very hard [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=329.90000000000003s)]
*  Carter was often [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=334.68s)]
*  Criticized for micromanaging. They said even if you wanted to play on the White House tennis court, you had to go through Carter [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=336.88000000000005s)]
*  He really moved everybody who went there [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=343.76000000000005s)]
*  But when you go to the Camp David Accords in those meetings up there at Camp David that was micromanaging [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  When it really worked because it wouldn't have happened had it not had he not been his micromanage [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=352.28s)]
*  It was interesting to hear Nora talk about the precision he had on timing because it was the constructive ambiguity [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=358.36s)]
*  That was the phrase they used that made the diplomacy possible not actually getting into hammering out [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=365.21999999999997s)]
*  can't help but witness this incredible collection of [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=370.4s)]
*  Vice presidents presidents want to be presidents in this first year on this is a snapshot of the complexity [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=374.44s)]
*  American politics and especially the American presidency you see President Barack Obama huddling right there with President-elect Trump [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=382.0s)]
*  I've spoken to President-elect Trump many times over the years about President Obama and let's remember it was Trump who questioned [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=388.76s)]
*  Obama's love of country and credentials with the birther crusade years ago [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=396.4s)]
*  But also Trump has told me over the years he respected politically [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=400.28s)]
*  How President Obama was able to win the presidency as a movement candidate an outsider candidate in? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=404.04s)]
*  2008 and some Trump advisors have said that model set forward by David Plouffe and [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=410.8s)]
*  Barack Obama inspired to appoint the Trump campaign of 2016 Vice President Kamala Harris [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=416.2s)]
*  President Bill Clinton, I know Leslie stall is is with us Leslie [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=423.96s)]
*  Nora I'm watching the ceremony here someone before said that [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=429.0s)]
*  President Carter had [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=435.44s)]
*  Written down expressed what he wanted in these ceremonies [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=437.48s)]
*  I'm a little amused because when he was president he [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=442.52s)]
*  He he didn't want to have these [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=447.8s)]
*  Ceremonies he what we call depomped the office [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=450.96s)]
*  He didn't want hail to the chief played by the trumpeters every time he walked in the room [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=455.04s)]
*  He got rid of that and he realized that that was a mistake [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=460.68s)]
*  The public wanted to see that the trappings of the presidency [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=464.96s)]
*  and so he had to [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=471.16s)]
*  Put that back in to to the regular [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=473.68s)]
*  Course of his day when he was president and he's come around to realize it obviously in the way [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=477.4s)]
*  This is a traditional [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=484.12s)]
*  Process and ceremony so that we can see the transition [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=488.04s)]
*  That takes place in our country from president to president to president and the importance of bringing all these people together [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=494.68s)]
*  I was struck by the fact. I think Douglas said that [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=502.12s)]
*  That President Carter [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=507.68s)]
*  Wanted the trumps to be there. He wanted all the past presidents to come together and [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=510.04s)]
*  Honor him celebrate [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=518.24s)]
*  He did so many things as I said to depomp the presidency it was kind of amusing at the time [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=520.6800000000001s)]
*  He used to carry his own suitcases on to Air Force one and people kept saying to him don't do that [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=527.0s)]
*  presidents don't do that but [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=533.4s)]
*  That may will play spirit. It was his spirit [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=536.44s)]
*  They will play hail to the chief again today and there we see President United States Joe Biden and the First Lady [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=539.76s)]
*  Jill Biden the last to enter in these final moments before the service is [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=546.52s)]
*  About to begin want to speak with Robert and Douglas Brinkley and what you see here in this [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=551.72s)]
*  Scene is everybody in a sense showing up and that was important to President Carter [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=556.72s)]
*  I ran into President Carter and Mrs. Carter in January of 2017 at the US Capitol [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=562.8s)]
*  They showed up for President Trump's inauguration that day and they were had a quiet presence observed it [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=568.16s)]
*  Paid their respects to the the moment then and [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=574.94s)]
*  Carter would often go to the Oval Office to meet with former presidents at certain gatherings [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=578.5400000000001s)]
*  And so you see here not everyone there loves each other or even likes each other [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=583.4000000000001s)]
*  But they respect President Carter and they respect the country [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=589.22s)]
*  And we remember when Jimmy Carter became president in in [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=592.7800000000001s)]
*  1977 we had been a divided country that Vietnam war it [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=596.7800000000001s)]
*  Cut us in half Doves versus Hawks young people versus old people era of civil civil rights, Vietnam and [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=600.5s)]
*  Gerald Ford had called his memoir a time to heal his presidential memoir Jimmy Carter's keeping faith [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=610.3s)]
*  What Carter and Ford wanted to do is get faith back in America's? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=617.66s)]
*  bipartisan tradition the whole better angels of our nature idea of Lincoln and [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=622.5s)]
*  Lo and behold what we're witnessing right now is really extraordinary [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=628.54s)]
*  Seeing Donald Trump meet with Mike Pence for the first time seeing Barack Obama [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=632.5799999999999s)]
*  Talking, you know with Donald Trump a Bill Clinton has been in George Washington [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=638.3399999999999s)]
*  Hospital a sick with fever just week ago and his work to get healthy enough to come to make sure that he's there [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTlpzxOagiA&t=644.5799999999999s)]
