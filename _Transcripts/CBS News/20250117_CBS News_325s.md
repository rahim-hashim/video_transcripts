# Will Trump save TikTok from U.S. ban?
**CBS News:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4)
*  Welcome in to CBS News 24 seven. I'm Reid Cowen. What a story this is. The U.S. Supreme Court sides with Congress upholding a ban on TikTok. It was unanimous and news making it that so justices refused to block a federal law banning that Chinese owned app that has, by the way, more than 170 million users in the United States. The conversation on TikTok right now is on fire. Bipartisan congressional support for that ban over national security. The reason. But then get this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=0.0s)]
*  President Joe Biden saying in recent hours he will not implement or enforce that ban. He's going to leave it squarely with the Trump administration on how to handle this. So that's the big question. How will the president elect Donald Trump uphold the ban? And the big question is this. Will he keep in mind the top boss of that Chinese owned app is attending Donald Trump's inauguration. So let's talk to CBS News money watch correspondent Kelly O'Grady. Big big big stakes here for president elect Donald Trump. So if he doesn't [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=30.0s)]
*  save TikTok, when are we likely to see this ban go into effect? And then how would that ban be implemented regardless of who enforces it? OK, so come Sunday, we're expecting to see that ban. That's when this law takes effect. January 19th. So it actually, even if president elect Trump were to try to do something when it comes to an executive order, in theory, this would be banned. Now, whether that's actually enforced as president Biden said, you know, he's going to leave that ban. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=60.0s)]
*  So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the law says. So that's what the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=90.0s)]
* Ã¥ [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=120.0s)]
*  The people of China have just said, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=150.0s)]
*  no, we're not going to sell. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=152.2s)]
*  What do you know about those offers? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=153.32s)]
*  So the public one, it's called the People's Bid. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=157.36s)]
*  This was from Frank McCourt and part of the investor. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=160.18s)]
*  A group that's behind this is, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=163.96s)]
*  oh, goodness, Kevin O'Leary. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=168.3s)]
*  That's right, we had a brain moment there. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=169.88s)]
*  Of course, from Shark Tank. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=171.52s)]
*  Big billionaires behind this, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=173.36s)]
*  and they have not disclosed what number [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=174.56s)]
*  they would be putting forth as the bid, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=177.6s)]
*  but they would be buying the US operations of TikTok, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=179.6s)]
*  not the algorithm. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  Last time around though, you sort of look at the names [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  that were involved in this [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=187.72s)]
*  under the first Trump administration. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  Microsoft was involved as a potential bidder. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=191.0s)]
*  Oracle was involved as a potential bidder. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=193.92s)]
*  Walmart was thrown around at a certain time. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=195.92s)]
*  I will say, any of the companies [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  that could be considering a bid, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=200.64s)]
*  and potentially the company might be interested [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=202.68s)]
*  in actually considering that bid, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=205.34s)]
*  because the Supreme Court has uphold this decision, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=207.44s)]
*  it would also need to go through [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=210.4s)]
*  anti-trust regulation reviews. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=211.8s)]
*  Something like a Meta or a Google, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=215.16s)]
*  it wouldn't make sense for them to actually buy it, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=217.64s)]
*  even though strategically it would make sense. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  So even if there is a bid and ByteDance [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=222.28s)]
*  is open to accepting that bid, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=224.68s)]
*  there's so many different processes [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  that this would actually need to be reviewed by. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=227.8s)]
*  And then the question, what happens to the app [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=229.96s)]
*  while we wait those processes? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=231.76s)]
*  This will be fascinating. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=233.32s)]
*  So let's talk about two other apps owned by Chinese company. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=234.4s)]
*  They're starting to make headlines. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=238.4s)]
*  Lemonade, RedNote, are those apps also at risk? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=239.72s)]
*  Because we had a guest on earlier [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=243.12s)]
*  who mentioned that CapCut, which I use to edit content, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  also is a part of this. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=248.32s)]
*  So this is where it's really interesting read. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=252.24s)]
*  So Lemonade is actually owned by ByteDance, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=254.68s)]
*  the same company that owns TikTok. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=257.76s)]
*  RedNote is a Chinese-owned company as well. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=259.96s)]
*  And so when this decision came down this morning, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=263.08s)]
*  it was actually in the language of the law originally. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=266.56s)]
*  And it states that any app like this [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=269.52s)]
*  that is owned by a foreign adversary, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=272.44s)]
*  which China is considered under this legislation, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=275.76s)]
*  is at risk for a ban. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  And so you see these users saying, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  oh, we don't care if we're on an app [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=283.28s)]
*  that is owned by a Chinese company. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=285.08s)]
*  We're gonna make a stand. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  We're gonna go to these other apps. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=287.56s)]
*  Those may actually be at risk as well, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=289.08s)]
*  especially because the Supreme Court [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=291.71999999999997s)]
*  said this law is constitutional. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=293.32s)]
*  The government could choose to actually go after these two [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=296.44s)]
*  as well, read. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=298.28s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=299.12s)]
*  What happens here could literally spell the future [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=299.96s)]
*  of so many other apps, not only existing right now, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=302.56s)]
*  but in the days to come. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=305.08s)]
*  That's why I'm glad you are in the chair to talk to [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=306.8s)]
*  about this. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=309.4s)]
*  CBS News Money Watch correspondent, Kelly O'Grady. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=310.24s)]
*  I wish you a great weekend, and we will see on Sunday [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=312.84s)]
*  if that app just disappears from the palm of our hands. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=315.56s)]
*  Thank you so much, my friend. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=318.84s)]
*  We'll also have an eye on Congress confirmation hearings [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0LVh6sEV4&t=320.4s)]
