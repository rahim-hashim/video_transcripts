*  Plus tariffs, tax cuts all on the horizon. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=23.92s)]
*  President Trump addresses those for the group gathered at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=27.28s)]
*  his virtual message on his plans to build the U.S. economy. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=32.36s)]

*  OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHILE. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=39.6s)]
*  If you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=40.6s)]
*  you will have to pay a tariff to further unleash our economy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=42.28s)]
*  Our majorities in the House and Senate, which we also took along with the presidency, are [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=46.8s)]
*  going to pass the largest tax cut in American history, including massive tax cuts for workers [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=53.28s)]
*  and families. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=58.56s)]
*  And on Capitol Hill, the Senate has now confirmed John Ratcliffe to lead the Central Intelligence [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=60.96s)]
*  Agency. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=65.8s)]
*  While President Trump's picked to lead the Defense Department, he might be on shaky ground. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=66.8s)]
*  It's an uncertain scene in the Senate as Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, two centrist [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=71.76s)]
*  Republicans, become the first in the GOP to say they won't vote to confirm Pete Hegseth. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=76.12s)]
*  We start our discussion tonight with Olivia Rinaldi and Scott McFarland, two of the best. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=82.52s)]
*  Great to have you both here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=86.52s)]
*  Scott, you're on Capitol Hill. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=88.28s)]
*  What is the latest on Pete Hegseth's nomination? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=89.56s)]
*  The statements late today from Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski that they are not going [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  to support this nomination had a lot of symmetry, Bob. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  Both of them reference Hegseth's previous comments criticizing women in combat roles. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=99.82s)]
*  Both acknowledge Hegseth seems to have evolved his thinking, but that they weren't confident [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=105.32s)]
*  he's evolved enough. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=110.08s)]
*  Lisa Murkowski added that she was troubled or given pause by the allegations of alcohol [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=111.88s)]
*  misuse and sexual misconduct by Hegseth, accusations he has denied. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=116.36s)]
*  None of this changes the trajectory Pete Hegseth is on. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  It appears destined he will win the necessary votes tomorrow night because two defecting [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=124.8s)]
*  Republicans is not sufficient to end this nomination. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=129.48s)]
*  And it does appear, Bob, this vote is to happen late tomorrow night. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=132.68s)]
*  Let's see what President Trump had to say to our colleague, Weijia Jiang, earlier today. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=138.4s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=143.34s)]
*  Are you worried about his confirmation and your reaction? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=144.34s)]
*  And no surprises there. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=150.12s)]
*  It's too bad. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=151.12s)]
*  You know, it's the way it is. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=152.12s)]
*  Too bad. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=154.72s)]
*  So you have President Trump standing by Pete Hegseth. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=157.4s)]
*  Olivia, when you talk to sources close to President Trump, are they feeling good about [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  Hegseth's chances? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=164.84s)]
*  You know, they're still watching very closely what's happening in the Senate. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=166.28s)]
*  Obviously, we heard from two centrist Republicans, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=169.44s)]
*  Those aren't quite surprising. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=173.44s)]
*  People knew that they might be on the fence, but they need a simple majority to get this [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  by, to get this nomination passed. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=179.52s)]
*  So they're watching very closely. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=181.6s)]
*  I've been talking to people close to Vance's circle. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=183.16s)]
*  Obviously, if he needs to step in to be that tie-breaking vote, he will. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=185.68s)]
*  They are confident that this will get across, though. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=189.32s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=192.6s)]
*  President Trump, Scott, continues to move forward with his executive actions. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  Let's listen to what Trump said about the judges ruling earlier today. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=197.84s)]
*  Obviously, we'll appeal it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=202.64s)]
*  They put it before a certain judge in Seattle, I guess, right? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=206.48s)]
*  And there's no surprises with that judge. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=211.16s)]
*  So Scott, there's also all the legislative outlook on the immigration border front. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=215.92s)]
*  What's going on with that, even as the president pursues his executive orders? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=220.72s)]
*  This executive order, which was to revoke birthright citizenship, a fundamental, foundational [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=225.48s)]
*  part codified in the U.S. Constitution for U.S. citizenship, the federal judge in Seattle, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=231.44s)]
*  who is a Reagan appointee, it's been around a while, said this was absolutely unconstitutional [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=237.84s)]
*  on its face. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=244.24s)]
*  The judge said it declaratively in the opening moments of the proceedings today over the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=245.24s)]
*  Trump executive order. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=249.4s)]
*  Trump's allies in the U.S. House have, over the course of this day, introduced legislation [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=251.24s)]
*  to make it law that birthright citizenship no longer exists in the United States. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=256.72s)]
*  And that's a process, a Herculean process, to try to get that through the Congress. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=261.68s)]
*  But this feels like one of those things, Bob, where Trump wins either way. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=266.44s)]
*  It looks like he's trying to get something done that he campaigned on. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=271.48s)]
*  And if somebody stands in the way, it looks like somebody's standing in the way of what [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=274.32s)]
*  he wants to do and what his voters want to have happen. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=278.68s)]
*  So there's a lot happening on Capitol Hill. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=282.44s)]
*  You have legislation, you have everyone processing the executive orders, you have these nominations. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=284.12s)]
*  Olivia, you've been tracking President Trump and his executive orders. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=289.8s)]
*  It's been such a blizzard of activity. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  It's hard for anyone, even reporters who do this for a living, to follow the activity. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=296.56s)]
*  Where do you find significance and meaning in some of these executive orders as someone [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=302.0s)]
*  who has covered not only the campaign but the transition? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  What are you watching? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=308.32s)]
*  What have you learned? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=309.32s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=310.32s)]
*  Bob, three big executive orders signed today that fall through on campaign promises that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=311.32s)]
*  he talked about throughout the two years that he ran. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  One being releasing the JFK, RFK, and MLK files. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=317.32s)]
*  He talked about that frequently. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=321.23999999999995s)]
*  He signed an executive order today saying that he would release those soon. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=322.79999999999995s)]
*  Now there has to be certain people in place, including the CIA director, for review to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=326.67999999999995s)]
*  happen of those files before they are ultimately released. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=332.4s)]
*  But the ball is rolling on that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=335.52s)]
*  The other one I want to bring up is Bitcoin. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=337.36s)]
*  I've been following this very closely. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=338.92s)]
*  I'm fascinated by it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=341.08s)]
*  The Bitcoin crypto community loves Trump. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  They've been embracing him. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=345.24s)]
*  They certainly threw a lot of weight behind him throughout the entire campaign. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=346.48s)]
*  But what we're starting to find too, and you're seeing a bolstering of Bitcoin since he was [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=351.24s)]
*  reelected. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=356.32s)]
*  Now it's over $100,000 per Bitcoin. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=357.32s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=359.88s)]
*  But they believe that Trump is going to create what they're calling a essentially stockpile [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=360.88s)]
*  reserve of Bitcoin, which would certainly bolster the cryptocurrency. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=366.16s)]
*  So Trump today signed an executive order that would create a Bitcoin internal group. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=370.24s)]
*  We saw David Sacks there in the Oval Office. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=375.56s)]
*  He's Trump's crypto czar, essentially. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=377.96s)]
*  And this would make the U.S. essentially the crypto capital of the world. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=381.48s)]
*  People within the crypto space that I talked to are extremely excited about this announcement. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=385.24s)]
*  I cannot even begin to tell you, because what that means is that the U.S. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=390.16s)]
*  will become the premier group in really essentially giving way to Bitcoin being a currency that [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=393.64s)]
*  we can use for bank transactions. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=401.32s)]
*  But also your 401Ks, your investments, it's legitimizing this cryptocurrency. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  So Trump really opening the door to that. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=410.28s)]
*  Quite notable. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=413.56s)]
*  It really is. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=414.56s)]
*  And Scott, meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, you're tracking the fallout over President Trump's [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=415.56s)]
*  pardons of those involved in January 6. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=420.08s)]
*  What are you learning? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=422.8s)]
*  Yeah, there's an emerging concern, Bob. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=423.8s)]
*  These pardons now have created a threat, a safety threat for some of the Democrats on [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=425.98s)]
*  the Hill, the police officers who testified at the trials, the tipsters who flagged the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=430.84s)]
*  FBI agents about these riot defendants. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  There may be some seeking of revenge. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=438.96s)]
*  Also, still a lot of political outrage that a blanket pardon was issued in the first place. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=441.0s)]
*  Take a listen to Senator Andy Kim, who you'll recall, Bob, was on his hands and knees cleaning [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=446.12s)]
*  up the damage of the riot on January 6. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=451.08000000000004s)]
*  The pardons were blanket and it was everybody. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=455.08000000000004s)]
*  You concerned about what that means for political violence moving forward? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=458.8s)]
*  Well, it gives the stamp of approval now about political violence, saying that, you know, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=462.72s)]
*  if you conduct political violence and it's in favor of Donald Trump for the next four [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=469.76s)]
*  years, then you'll be OK. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=476.96000000000004s)]
*  Bob, you recall, Oath Keepers founder and January 6 defendant Elmer Stewart Rhodes was [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=478.72s)]
*  at the Capitol yesterday. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=486.0s)]
*  A lot of the police noticed him in one of the Capitol Office buildings. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=487.16s)]
*  Thank you, Scott. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=491.6s)]
*  And finally, Olivia, you have President Trump talking to world leaders. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=493.64000000000004s)]
*  Let's listen to what he had to say today about Saudi Arabia. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=498.32000000000005s)]
*  Saudi Arabia will be investing at least $600 billion in America. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  But I'll be asking the crown prince, who's a fantastic guy, to round it out to around [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=508.6s)]
*  one trillion. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=513.4s)]
*  I think they'll do that. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=514.4s)]
*  What have you learned about whether President Trump's going to go there in the coming weeks [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=515.96s)]
*  or not? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=519.64s)]
*  Yeah, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, saying he's going to invest about [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=520.64s)]
*  six hundred billion dollars in the U.S. over the next four years, a direct result of Trump [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=524.48s)]
*  being elected. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=529.52s)]
*  Trump today, though, in Davos, said he'd like to see that go up to a trillion dollars. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=530.52s)]
*  A little bit of negotiation going on from him there. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=534.44s)]
*  We know during his first administration back in 2017, his first international trip was [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=537.32s)]
*  to Saudi Arabia. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=542.2s)]
*  Now, that was a big signal to everyone in the Middle East. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=543.2s)]
*  That's an ally of the U.S. and he's going to really cultivate that relationship. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=546.84s)]
*  Now, during the Biden years, it got a little frosty. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=551.32s)]
*  You know, Biden gave a little bit of space there, especially after the murder of Jamal [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=553.88s)]
*  Khashoggi, something that created a rift between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, certainly [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=558.52s)]
*  under the Biden presidency. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=562.12s)]
*  Trump today, saying he spoke with the crown prince, called him a fantastic guy. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=564.0400000000001s)]
*  And earlier this week, we heard from President Trump in the Oval Office saying that he could [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=569.08s)]
*  potentially replicate what he did back in 2017 and make his first international trip [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=572.8000000000001s)]
*  Saudi Arabia again. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=577.8000000000001s)]
*  And that would certainly signal to all of our allies in the Middle East that this is [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=580.88s)]
*  an important relationship. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=585.76s)]
*  Again, he is focused on cultivating it. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=586.76s)]
*  Also sends a big message to the ongoing war between Israel and Gaza about what he's thinking [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=588.84s)]
*  there and perhaps that normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, something [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=594.92s)]
*  he was working on within those final days in office. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=599.84s)]
*  Great. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=602.84s)]
*  Thank you, Olivia Rinaldi. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=603.84s)]
*  Scott McFarland, we appreciate your reporting. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=605.2s)]
*  As always... [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUWCeUwy0p0&t=607.76s)]
