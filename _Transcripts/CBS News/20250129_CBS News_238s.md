# Trump immigration crackdown continues with more ICE raids
**CBS News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64)
*  President Trump's crackdown on undocumented immigrants continues as ice carries out raids in major cities across the country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=0.0s)]
*  One man from Florida is pleading with the president to let his Venezuelan wife stay in the U.S. after she was detained. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  If I get a chance to talk to you, man, please, man, let's work something out. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=15.0s)]
*  So, man, let me keep my wife here in the United States. She deserves to be here, man. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=18.6s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News immigration and politics reporter, Camila Montoya-Galvez, for more on this. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=23.2s)]
*  Camila, you frequently break headlines on this topic, and I know that you reported that the U.S. military now is allowing ICE to use a base in Aurora, Colorado, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=28.6s)]
*  to help as part of this efforts to continue raids in that state. What more do we know about that? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=38.6s)]
*  Well, as you know, Errol, ICE Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been ramping up enforcement operations to arrest unauthorized immigrants across the U.S., [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=44.6s)]
*  mainly targeting sanctuary jurisdictions across the country. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=53.6s)]
*  But the agency, Errol, is quickly running out of space to hold these immigrants awaiting deportation. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=58.2s)]
*  Congress only allocated 41,000 beds for ICE. That is not nearly enough to detain everyone the agency is currently arresting on a daily basis. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=64.2s)]
*  And so now the administration is turning to the Department of Defense, Errol, to expand migrant holding capacity dramatically. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=73.8s)]
*  We just learned that the U.S. military, the Pentagon, has allowed ICE to use a base in Aurora, Colorado to hold migrants with criminal records [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=82.0s)]
*  who are going to be arrested in an expected operation in that region. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=92.0s)]
*  We understand that the military will not be directly overseeing the detention of these undocumented detainees, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=97.1s)]
*  but that ICE will be able to use these facilities as staging and temporary holding areas while these immigrants await deportation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=104.0s)]
*  And the role of the military could expand further, Errol. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=111.6s)]
*  We obtained an internal government memo that suggests that as many as 10,000 troops could be used to be deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border to help immigration officials there, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=115.8s)]
*  and that more military installations could be repurposed as temporary migrant holding facilities. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=126.0s)]
*  So this surely will not be the last facility to be used for this purpose, Errol. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=132.29999999999998s)]
*  Another interesting aspect of all this, Camillo, is that many of these raids, as we're calling them, are being filmed. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=137.29999999999998s)]
*  Yesterday, our Major Garrett spoke with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem about the purpose of recording these raids. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=143.89999999999998s)]
*  Let's just quickly show that to our viewers. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=151.0s)]
*  It's not a spectacle. This is our nation's law enforcement judicial process. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=153.2s)]
*  The scales of justice are equally applied to everybody. We want transparency on this. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=159.1s)]
*  DHS Secretary conducting raids here in New York last night. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=165.2s)]
*  Camillo, what do we know about how these roundups are being conducted? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, it's important to underscore, Errol, that while ICE has, of course, expanded and increased operations across the country to arrest people here who are in the country illegally, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  it is still prioritizing, just like every other past administration, the arrests of serious criminals and national security threats. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=187.0s)]
*  They are still the main targets of these operations. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=194.2s)]
*  The main policy change, however, Errol, is that unlike in the Biden administration and the Obama administration, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=197.0s)]
*  ICE can also now arrest non-criminal, undocumented immigrants who happen to be at these locations when the agency is conducting these arrests. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=203.7s)]
*  These are known as collateral arrests, and we have seen a significant increase in these arrests of, again, people who are in the country illegally, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=213.39999999999998s)]
*  but who lack any serious criminal record and who under the Biden administration would have been effectively protected from deportation. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=221.4s)]
*  They are now on the table to be deported from the country, Errol. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=228.70000000000002s)]
*  We will keep watching this closely. Camillo Montoya Galvez joining us from our D.C. Bureau. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=232.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tanNXT5h64&t=236.8s)]
