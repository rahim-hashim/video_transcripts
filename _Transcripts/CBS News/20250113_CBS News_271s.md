# Warren releases intense questions for Hegseth confirmation hearing
**CBS News:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk)
*  Welcome back to CBS News 24-7. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=0.0s)]
*  The individuals Donald Trump tasked with leading the nation's top posts will take the hot seat [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  this week. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  You see them here behind me on this graphic. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=8.14s)]
*  13 Trump nominees officially kick off their nomination process by fielding questions on [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=10.08s)]
*  their backgrounds. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Some of those picks having a tough go with senators and closed door meetings. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=16.28s)]
*  Well now they will take those questions publicly. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  The man likely to face the most stern line of questioning, Trump's controversial pick [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  to lead the defense department. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=27.12s)]
*  We're talking about Pete Hegseth. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=29.08s)]
*  So let's go live to CBS News congressional correspondent Scott McFarland. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=31.0s)]
*  Alright so Scott, Senator Elizabeth Warren released 72 questions that she plans to ask [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=34.44s)]
*  Mr. Hegseth tomorrow. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=40.2s)]
*  Here are two and I just want to read these to our viewers. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=42.68s)]
*  Have you ever received any treatment for substance abuse or alcohol? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=45.76s)]
*  That's the first one. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  And then she plans to ask how many times have you been accused of sexually harassing or [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  sexually assaulting another individual? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  So in the midst of these questions, what is the risk for Pete Hegseth where the votes [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=59.0s)]
*  are concerned? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=63.52s)]
*  No matter where the votes are, there is a bright spotlight on Pete Hegseth as he answers [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=64.52000000000001s)]
*  those questions. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=72.16s)]
*  He has the nation's attention. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=73.16s)]
*  There are these series of hearings this week but he goes first and it seems clear as the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  week begins here that he is top of mind for senators because he is trying to become the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=80.28s)]
*  defense secretary charged with overseeing millions of people, service members, contractors [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=85.39999999999999s)]
*  and all that goes into protecting America. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  It's an enormous job. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=94.0s)]
*  It's a remarkably complex bureaucracy but until today really, Democrats have kept their [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  powder dry about Pete Hegseth. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  Republicans have expressed some concerns or equivocated a bit about their support for [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  Hegseth but now it's Democrats who have the time in the hearing to make their argument [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=106.28s)]
*  and pose their questions. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=111.72s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren is forecasting where some of this is going. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=113.12s)]
*  They're going to ask about his experience level. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  Is he experienced enough for this complex bureaucracy? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=118.4s)]
*  But also about those accusations Hegseth has denied from the start about previous alcohol [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=121.64s)]
*  abuse and that sexual misconduct allegation from 2017 in California. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  He has denied all of those allegations. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=131.56s)]
*  So what else are you watching for as these confirmation hearings play out, Scott? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=134.8s)]
*  I'd love for you to put that graphic back up showing the many people going for job interviews [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=140.08s)]
*  at the U.S. Senate this week. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=144.48s)]
*  It's about a dozen and that's very limited bandwidth and time for Democrats to mobilize [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=146.0s)]
*  and galvanize against any one of those faces you see. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=151.32s)]
*  So much is happening at once. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=154.8s)]
*  They're going to have to pick their spots. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=155.96s)]
*  January 15th stands out to me though. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=157.96s)]
*  The top left and top right there. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=160.16s)]
*  Governor Kristi Noem of South Dakota trying to be the nation's homeland security secretary [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=162.44s)]
*  with oversight presumably read of the mass deportation plans of President-elect Trump. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=166.8s)]
*  And then Pam Bondi. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=172.84s)]
*  She has two days of hearings to become the nation's top law enforcement official, the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=173.84s)]
*  U.S. Attorney General at a moment when there are hundreds of pending January 6 cases, promises [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=177.68s)]
*  by Trump of pardons and fears that Trump will use the Department of Justice to go after [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  his political enemies. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=189.28s)]
*  Pam Bondi may not have big opponents in the Senate, but they have big questions for her. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=192.2s)]
*  While we have you here, Scott, we just got this moment to go some breaking news that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=198.56s)]
*  order by Florida Judge Eileen Cannon saying that she'll allow the release at least some [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=202.48s)]
*  of special counsel Jack Smith's report into the investigation into the 2020 election interference [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=206.76s)]
*  case. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=212.04s)]
*  What more are you learning here and what kind of vibrations are you getting there on Capitol [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=213.04s)]
*  Hill among lawmakers? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=216.84s)]
*  To be clear, this opens the door for America to be able to read everything that Jack Smith [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=220.88s)]
*  put in his final report, what he found in his investigation of 2020 election interference. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=224.68s)]
*  Judge Cannon's ruling still keeps restricted Jack Smith's findings about the classified [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=229.92s)]
*  records case involving Trump because Trump has former co-defendants still going through [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=234.28s)]
*  the criminal system and Judge Cannon wants to hold it back to protect that case. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  This could be released as early as midnight Eastern time, but the vibes we're getting [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=243.24s)]
*  is that the Trump team or those other defendants in Florida could try to make another appeal [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=248.0s)]
*  of what Judge Cannon just did, further sliding the time frame back from midnight to a date [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  and time uncertain. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=257.59999999999997s)]
*  Not many days ago, the president-elect called Judge Cannon brilliant. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=259.24s)]
*  It'll be fascinating to watch Truth Social and see what he has to say about her now. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=262.47999999999996s)]
*  He did not want this development. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=265.91999999999996s)]
*  Scott McFarland, always great to talk to you. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=267.32s)]
*  Have a good day. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirStemkxDk&t=269.76s)]
