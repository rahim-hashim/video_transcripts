# Concern DOGE could stop Social Security, Medicare payments
**CBS News:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk)
*  Elon Musk now has access to a payment system within the Treasury Department containing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=0.0s)]
*  the personal data of millions of Americans. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=5.3s)]
*  The Department of Efficiency gained control of what's called the Bureau of Fiscal Service. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=8.68s)]
*  This comes as the DOGE task force sweeps through the federal bureaucracy, taking aim at programs [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=13.56s)]
*  and employees, one agency at a time. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=19.8s)]
*  So let's start here. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=22.56s)]
*  What is the Bureau of Fiscal Service? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  The Bureau of Fiscal Service is a unit within the Treasury Department that acts as the federal [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=26.2s)]
*  government's checkbook. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=29.8s)]
*  It controls the flow of nearly 90% of all federal payments, including Social Security [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=31.52s)]
*  checks, IRS tax refunds, and veterans' benefits. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=37.08s)]
*  In fiscal year 2023, the division gave out more than one billion payments, totaling over [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=41.68s)]
*  $5 trillion, collected more than $5 trillion in federal revenue, and managed an average [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=47.32s)]
*  daily cash flow of more than $200 billion. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=53.8s)]
*  A lot of money here. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=57.32s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News Money Watch correspondent Kelly O'Grady. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=58.96s)]
*  Kelly, thank you so much for joining us on the stream today. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  Can you tell us more about why Elon Musk's access to this payment system is raising a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=65.28s)]
*  lot of alarm? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=70.16s)]
*  Yeah, so it's kind of two areas. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=71.8s)]
*  The first I would say is there is a concern that this DOGE investigation could lead to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=75.44s)]
*  the federal government stopping some of these very big payment systems and services. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=82.04s)]
*  So think things like Social Security and Medicaid. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=87.16s)]
*  The other concern that people have is just the access to such sensitive personal information. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=90.64s)]
*  And so that would be things like your Social Security number, your bank information, right, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=97.64s)]
*  if you do direct deposit when you get your tax refund check in a couple of months. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=103.12s)]
*  I will note that CBS News obtained a letter that says the access that DOGE was granted [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=108.16s)]
*  was essentially read only. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=114.16s)]
*  And it's very, very similar to when these agencies go through an audit for their systems [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=116.24s)]
*  and their practices and security and all of that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  So the pushback is that these concerns that I just mentioned, they aren't really any different [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=124.97999999999999s)]
*  than other agencies that have had this type of access in the past. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=130.56s)]
*  Yes, I think there's just a little bit of concern because DOGE is so new. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=135.23999999999998s)]
*  This process is new, but it is very similar to audit access we are learning. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=139.88s)]
*  Okay, Kelly, let's talk about President Trump's tariffs on China because it could make cheap [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  fast fashion brands like Ti Mu and also Xi'an a little bit pricier. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=148.6s)]
*  So is this the end of that massive hole that some Americans really enjoy buying? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  Because again, it's really cheap. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=159.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, you know, it might be. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=163.2s)]
*  I still think you'll probably see those massive holes. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  They just might be a little bit more expensive. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=168.32s)]
*  So President Trump closed what they call a loophole. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=170.45999999999998s)]
*  It was called de minimis. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  And this is actually nearly a century old loophole. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  And it allowed packages that were under the value of $800, so that would be a lot of items [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  from Ti Mu and Xi'an, to enter the United States duty free. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=184.56s)]
*  And so there would be no fees or taxes were paid on that coming into the U.S. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=188.92s)]
*  So now that that is closed, things would, in theory, cost more because when you're buying [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=193.64s)]
*  all of your packages and you're getting it shipped to your house, you would have to assume [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=198.51999999999998s)]
*  that the company is going to pass some of that cost on to you, the consumer. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  Now, the reason why they're doing this is one, there are so many packages coming in [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=207.27999999999997s)]
*  that it is a good way to find some extra money. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=211.64s)]
*  But also there's a concern about fentanyl flowing in, fraudulent goods, that there's [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=214.76s)]
*  so many of these packages coming in that there's just not enough resources to inspect everyone. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=220.44s)]
*  So it's a little bit of a monetary but also a security piece. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=226.24s)]
*  Never even thought of the security angle of that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=230.24s)]
*  And finally, Kelly, we want to ask you about Google. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  The company is backpedaling on its pledge not to use artificial intelligence for weapons [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=235.12s)]
*  or surveillance. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=240.88s)]
*  Do we know what's driving this move? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=241.88s)]
*  Well, you know, I think it's mainly that this is what a lot of other companies are doing. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=245.68s)]
*  I'm just going to read you a quote from their original AI principles and then sort of highlight [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=251.36s)]
*  how it's differently. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=256.48s)]
*  So, originally, Google said that it would explicitly not pursue AI that could be used [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=257.48s)]
*  for applications such as, quote, weapons or other technologies whose principal purpose [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=262.12s)]
*  or implementation is to cause and directly facilitate injury to people. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=266.08s)]
*  This was part of their original ethical code. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=270.6s)]
*  And then yesterday, they rolled that back and said, well, this is important for different [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=272.4s)]
*  companies and countries that support democracy to work together for a national security perspective. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=278.0s)]
*  There's a lot of news going on in the world, but I really think this is important to highlight [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=284.56s)]
*  because you do have China, who is making these advancements in AI, that could help in a term [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=289.12s)]
*  defense technology, weaponry. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=296.4s)]
*  And so there is an argument to be made that having our best companies working on this [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=298.12s)]
*  type of thing, including Google, is important. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=302.0s)]
*  But there is that other element that when you have these companies developing these [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=304.84s)]
*  technologies that lead to defense contracts more coming in, there is, you know, there [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=308.16s)]
*  is a reason to question that type of activity. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=313.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=317.24s)]
*  Kelly O'Grady, as always, thank you so much for your time. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9sP1ahqOjk&t=318.24s)]
