# Parts of the South pummeled by winter storm
**CBS News:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0)
*  Parts of the southern United States are being pummeled by a major winter storm. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=0.0s)]
*  This footage from suburban Dallas shows what looks like a winter wonderland in [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=4.8s)]
*  an area that is simply not used to this type of snow. The storm stretching from [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=9.72s)]
*  Arkansas to Virginia with some of the worst conditions in the Tennessee area. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=14.46s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Nicole Valdez joins us now from Nashville for more on [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=18.2s)]
*  the winter weather that is sweeping across the South. So Nicole, Nashville [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=22.72s)]
*  isn't usually as snowy as you appear to be at the moment. Talk to us about the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=27.6s)]
*  situation on the ground. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=33.08s)]
*  Hey Lana, yes, several inches of snow on the ground is quite an unusual site for [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=37.0s)]
*  Music City and it's why we've seen so much really emphasis on messaging and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  safety several days out from this store. What we're talking about right now is [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=46.2s)]
*  at least three, maybe four inches of snow on the ground and there's still so [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=51.08s)]
*  much more expected to fall as the storm really won't stop until maybe [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=55.2s)]
*  sometime Saturday morning. The truck beside me gives you a bit of a glimpse [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=60.720000000000006s)]
*  of what we've seen so far. But by the end of this, we could be talking 7 to 8 [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=64.36s)]
*  inches of snowfall and it's falling fast about an inch an hour. So that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=69.0s)]
*  definitely creates quite the possibility of a lot of problems because truthfully [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=73.80000000000001s)]
*  this is a region that is not accustomed to navigating travel in this kind of [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=79.56s)]
*  weather conditions. So you've got issues on the freeways. We're talking areas [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=85.68s)]
*  like the I-24 and I-42, very busy freeways that pass through the city of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=90.36s)]
*  Nashville that have seen several crashes in some areas are shut down. We've also [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=96.28s)]
*  got hundreds of flights canceled coming to and from Nashville International [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=101.12s)]
*  Airport because of the conditions that we're seeing play out here. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  And Nicolai, I see I am joined by our CBS News meteorologist here in the studio. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  We're going to talk in just a second. But John and I are both responding to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=113.92s)]
*  what we're seeing there. Talk to us about the preparations the city has in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=117.48s)]
*  place to try and handle this level of precipitation. I mean, when you're [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=121.08s)]
*  talking 6 to 8 inches, does it actually have the infrastructure to deal with [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=124.76s)]
*  that amount of snowfall? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=129.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think really state and city leaders do a lot of preparation before [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=133.0s)]
*  the storm starts to try to prevent the amount of problems that can come into [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=137.0s)]
*  play here, which really, again, is focused in on travel, the domino effect [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=141.2s)]
*  that is. So they do a lot of pre-treating of roads. They use brine, they use salt, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=145.24s)]
*  they got salt trucks about 300 or so that go out to all the major freeways and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=149.08s)]
*  try to prep them beforehand. And once the storm starts, what then happens is [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=154.08s)]
*  they've got their 40 or so snow plows throughout the metro Nashville area that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=158.36s)]
*  are trying to clear roads as that snow falls. But you're right, this is an [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=163.62s)]
*  infrastructure situation that is not necessarily comparable to states further [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=167.54s)]
*  north of us. So this is a challenge every time we get a significant snowfall [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=172.3s)]
*  like what we're seeing now. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=176.94s)]
*  All right, Nicole Valdez, thank you. Stay warm. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=178.06s)]
*  All right, climate watch now, a new data on global temperatures reveals 2024 was [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=180.18s)]
*  the warmest year ever. A new study released today shows global temperatures [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=197.94s)]
*  were more than two degrees higher than the 20th century baselines, and it [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=202.82s)]
*  follows 15 straight months of record setting temperatures. That's all [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=206.86s)]
*  according to the space agency, NASA and the National Atmospheric and Oceanic [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=210.9s)]
*  Administration, better known as NOAA, and also marks the planet's warmest year in [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=215.06s)]
*  almost 175 years of record keeping. And joining us live in studio to discuss how [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=219.54000000000002s)]
*  all of these increases in temperatures are screwing with our weather, CBS News, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=226.06s)]
*  New York meteorologist John Elliott. Hey, John. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=231.62s)]
*  Nashville, snowing in Nashville. You got to go up the hill into the, I mean, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=233.73999999999998s)]
*  Chattanooga with more hills and more snow. We're going to have ice in South [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=237.98s)]
*  Carolina and we're talking about global warming. I know it turns a lot of people [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=241.33999999999997s)]
*  off, but when you look at the numbers, the average in, in fact, we have a graph, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=245.22s)]
*  the average, it's just a little bit on the graph, but the impact with these [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=250.1s)]
*  amplified waves. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=253.82s)]
*  And it just puts everything out of whack then. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=255.01999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=257.21999999999997s)]
*  So exactly how hot was 2024? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=257.94s)]
*  Hottest ever. Two Fahrenheit versus Celsius, again, you know, we're using [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=260.02s)]
*  Celsius on the map. It's 2.3 for US, 2.7 globally, and it's the first time Europe [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=264.82s)]
*  and the states have had the, again, the hottest ever since 1998. And now this is [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=272.17999999999995s)]
*  a new hottest ever. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=277.73999999999995s)]
*  And what are the impacts of these, what seem like minuscule changes, right? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=279.02s)]
*  Two degrees doesn't seem like it's anything that you could feel, but it has [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=283.85999999999996s)]
*  all of these major impacts and all these headlines we're talking about wrapped [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=288.14000000000004s)]
*  into it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=291.14000000000004s)]
*  I am so glad you brought that up because, you know, you, we get lost in the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=291.58000000000004s)]
*  statistics. How about this? 27, one billion dollar storm events, 27 at a [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=295.58000000000004s)]
*  billion. But now let's talk about specific storm events. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=304.3s)]
*  Helene, Milton, Helene, not only the storm event, but also the billions of [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=308.22s)]
*  dollars and also the loss of life in Florida. Yes, more in North Carolina. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=314.26000000000005s)]
*  And then with right after that, you had Milton. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=319.42s)]
*  Another thing we're noticing is the the closeness together of event event 2024, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=322.62s)]
*  the shortest time period between billion dollar event ever, meaning these major [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=329.22s)]
*  storms are happening more often and they're happening closer together, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=335.66s)]
*  circling back to infrastructure, circling back to the fires. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=340.34000000000003s)]
*  How do you get the crews and resources to clean up and rebuild when you've got [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=343.54s)]
*  another storm on the way before? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=348.06s)]
*  I know I've messed with everybody's time here. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=350.62s)]
*  I just want to take this on. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=352.65999999999997s)]
*  It was just talking and hopefully our audience is enjoying it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=353.94s)]
*  So it was the fourth most expensive in dollars. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=357.14s)]
*  It was the eighth deadliest. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=362.06s)]
*  Now, there's some there's some there's some wisdom there. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=364.82s)]
*  Communication is getting better. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=367.98s)]
*  We're informing people better, but the costs are going to continue to skyrocket. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=369.82s)]
*  And that has an implication, not just on the relief and rebuilding efforts that go [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=374.42s)]
*  into all this, but also insurance. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=380.14s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=382.02s)]
*  All right, John Elliott, always good when you stop by the studio. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=383.86s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuIkQMppn0&t=386.22s)]
