# Commercial plane crashes midair with military helicopter near Reagan National Airport
**CBS News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac)
*  And good evening. It is 1034 here on the East Coast, and this is a CBS News special report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Christine Johnson in New York. We're coming on the air once again with more details about [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=12.68s)]
*  that breaking news story out of Washington, D.C. here tonight. A commercial airline has [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=18.2s)]
*  with a helicopter in midair while on approach to Reagan National Airport. The passenger plane [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  then crashed into the Potomac River. CBS News has confirmed there were 60 passengers and four crew [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=31.28s)]
*  members on board. It was an American Airlines flight that departed from Wichita, Kansas. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  The FAA has confirmed it was a PSA Airlines jet operating as American Airlines flight 5342 [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  that departed, as we said, from Wichita, Kansas. The FAA says that the jet collided with a Sikorsky [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=53.2s)]
*  H-60 helicopter. It's a military helicopter that's more commonly known as a Black Hawk. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=60.24s)]
*  Its collision happened while the passenger plane was on approach to runway 33 at Reagan [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=67.2s)]
*  Washington National Airport around 9 p.m. local time, Eastern Standard Time. White House [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=73.2s)]
*  press secretary Caroline Levitt said President Donald Trump has been made aware of this situation [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=79.52s)]
*  and tragically it does appear that a military helicopter collided with a regional jet. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=84.96s)]
*  The FAA has a result, has grounded all planes at Reagan Airport and also Washington's police said [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=91.44s)]
*  multiple agencies were responding to the crash site in the Potomac. Police have also said that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=99.44s)]
*  fire boats have joined this operation. Now imagine how chilly the Potomac River is currently. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=106.32s)]
*  We've had a very cold, cold spell here on the East Coast the past few weeks. Let's now turn to our [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=113.44s)]
*  CBS's senior transportation correspondent Chris Van Cleave. Chris, what more can you add to what [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=120.88s)]
*  we know right now? Christine, what we know is the CRJ 700 was just really moments from touching down [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=127.35999999999999s)]
*  at Washington Reagan Airport when it appears these two aircraft collided and then plunged into the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=135.76s)]
*  Potomac River. It's about 37 degrees there in Washington tonight. That's going to be very cold [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  water. Time is going to be of the essence here. We understand 64 people on board. That's 60 passengers, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=148.0s)]
*  four crew, two pilots, two flight attendants. You have an airspace that is shared between the planes [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=154.56s)]
*  coming in and out of Washington Reagan National Airport as well as military aircraft that often [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=161.68s)]
*  operate in and around the DC area. Bowling Air Force Base is just across the Potomac River, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=167.52s)]
*  for example. That's home to a lot of helicopters. I don't know that that's where this helicopter [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=172.4s)]
*  came from, but there's a lot of air traffic in that area. That's not uncommon. What is [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=177.12s)]
*  very uncommon obviously is for a close call or collision like this. We know there is a small army [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=181.12s)]
*  of first responders that are working to get to anyone who survived this accident as quickly as [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=188.0s)]
*  possible. Time is of the essence. We have talked for a long time about how we're in an unparalleled [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=193.84s)]
*  period of aviation safety. The last aviation airline accident with a commercial airliner [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=200.0s)]
*  was in 2009. That unparalleled period of safety appears to have ended tonight. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=205.84s)]
*  Chris, if you can please stand by. We want to go to Josh Gross. He joins us now on the phone. He's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=211.36s)]
*  a producer here with CBS. Josh, I understand that you are at the scene right now. What are you [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=216.64s)]
*  witnessing? You can just see the scene, but the rescue operation seems to be stretched across [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=223.27999999999997s)]
*  about a half mile to a mile of the Potomac River, starting at the airport terminal or runway 33 and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  then stretching south. The Potomac runs right between the airport itself and airport Anacostic [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=238.16s)]
*  bowling and there seems to be operations on both sides of the river. Josh, it's very hard to see [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=245.6s)]
*  much of anything due to the darkness there. We're showing our viewers emergency lights that seem to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  go from one end of the screen to the other. Are you able to see any rescue operations that are [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=258.8s)]
*  happening and do you see the plane in the river? Unfortunately, I'm on the same side of the river [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=264.56s)]
*  as the cameras. Places where there are operations that seem to be taking place are areas that are [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=272.08s)]
*  not accessible by the public. It's right off the airport itself or the base and we can't just drive [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=278.08s)]
*  our vehicles on there. There are at least three helicopters in the sky. One seems to be hovering [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  directly over one of the busier areas in terms of rescue vehicles, but it's too dark to see any [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=291.84s)]
*  airplane wreckage or any helicopter or anything like that in the water. It is too dark and too [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  far away. All right, Josh, we appreciate that update from you. Please stay on scene and stay [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=306.24s)]
*  on the phone line and of course when you get new information we'll get back to you. In the meantime, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=312.24s)]
*  Chris, I'd like to go back to you and just talk more about the operations that usually take place [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=316.96s)]
*  in the sky over the Potomac, particularly during this hour of night. Is a Black Hawk helicopter [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=324.79999999999995s)]
*  commonly seen doing operations, possibly practicing military moves and that sort of thing? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  It is not an uncommon sight to see a Black Hawk helicopter in the D.C. area. The Pentagon is just [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=341.76s)]
*  on the other side of Washington Reagan Airport. You have military bases that are home to things [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  like Air Force One and Marine One, the presidential helicopter. So it is not uncommon to see military [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=352.48s)]
*  helicopters in that area. You also see police helicopters in that area. In fact, I was up in [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=360.24s)]
*  the D.C. police helicopter near Reagan Airport just the other day ahead of the inauguration and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=365.20000000000005s)]
*  there's considerable care taken. We made a very steep descent to get underneath a certain altitude [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=370.88s)]
*  so we wouldn't be in the path of taking off of planes that were taking off from Reagan. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=377.6s)]
*  What's going to happen now, Christine, there's a rescue operation. That's why traffic has been [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=381.92s)]
*  halted at Washington's Reagan Airport. They don't need additional airplanes coming in and out to [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=385.92s)]
*  complicate what's going on in the water now. This is a rescue operation that's primary. So flights [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=390.72s)]
*  going into Washington Reagan are being diverted elsewhere. That airport is basically not operating [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=395.44s)]
*  right now. The National Transportation Safety Board is getting briefed. They will lead this [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=399.6s)]
*  investigation. They are incredibly good at what they do. In fact, they just recently trained on [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=404.56s)]
*  a plane crash scenario because it has been so long since there's been one in the United States. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=410.96s)]
*  They will begin looking at what happened here. Obviously, one of the goals very quickly will be [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=418.96s)]
*  to get the onboard voice and data recorders from that airplane as well as any sort of data recorder [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=423.12s)]
*  information onboard this helicopter. The military tends to investigate military crashes. They will [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=429.59999999999997s)]
*  likely participate in this, but we hear the NTSB will be the lead agency here. And Chris, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=435.67999999999995s)]
*  quickly tell our viewers about this regional jet, American Airlines, run by American Eagle. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=440.56s)]
*  This is just a normal passenger plane. Correct. This is a two-engine jet. It seats in American's [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=446.4s)]
*  configuration up to about 78 passengers. You have certainly seen them at an airport. It's a very [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=455.2s)]
*  common regional jet. It operates, it'll say American Eagle on the side. It is owned and operated by PSA, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=461.6s)]
*  which is an airline owned wholly by American Airlines. I have flown on these airplanes all [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=467.52s)]
*  the time. They come in and out of Washington, Reagan many, many times a day. So this is a very [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  common airliner. It has a good safety history. Obviously here, the investigation is going to [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=478.15999999999997s)]
*  focus on how it is these two aircraft collided so close to Washington, Reagan airport. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=484.08s)]
*  Chris Van Cleef, thank you. Once again, we're following developing details out of Washington, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=491.52s)]
*  DC, where we know that a Blackhawk helicopter has collided with an American Airlines, Eagle regional [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=497.68s)]
*  jet, 60 passengers on board, four crew members. A massive rescue effort is happening right now [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=504.88s)]
*  in the Potomac River. The transportation secretary did just post on social media that he is at FAA [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=512.8s)]
*  headquarters. Transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, just sworn in a few hours ago here this [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=519.84s)]
*  evening. Stay with CBS News as we will be following these details on this story and of course update [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=525.6s)]
*  you as we learn more. Our coverage will continue on CBS News 24 seven, of course your local news [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  and on CBS mornings. This has been a CBS News special report. I'm Christine Johnson reporting from New York. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9limEBcac&t=538.72s)]
