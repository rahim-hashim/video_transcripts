# Court hearing over Trump's birthright citizenship executive order
**CBS News:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE)
*  the president's executive order. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you. Thanks to Scott [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=5.0s)]
*  McFarland for that report. And [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=7.0s)]
*  right now, a hearing is taking [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=9.0s)]
*  place in Boston over a birth [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=11.0s)]
*  right citizenship lawsuit filed [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=13.0s)]
*  by 18 Democratic led states. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=15.0s)]
*  This has to do with President [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=17.0s)]
*  Trump's executive order ending [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=19.0s)]
*  automatic citizenship for babies [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=21.0s)]
*  born on U. S soil to parents in [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=23.0s)]
*  the country illegally. Now [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=25.0s)]
*  before the hearing, a few of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=26.0s)]
*  those attorneys general spoke [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=28.0s)]
*  about the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=29.0s)]
*  original. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=31.0s)]
*  If you're an originalist, if [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=33.0s)]
*  you're a textualist, if you're [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=34.0s)]
*  Justice Gorsuch, are you hearing [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=35.0s)]
*  me? Justice Gorsuch. If you [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=37.0s)]
*  read the language, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=39.0s)]
*  Okay, it could not be more [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=41.0s)]
*  clear. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=43.0s)]
*  You're born on American soil. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=45.0s)]
*  You're an American. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=47.0s)]
*  Why is that matter to so many [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=49.0s)]
*  of us? Why is it so personal? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=50.0s)]
*  Because if that's not true, I'm [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=53.0s)]
*  not standing here. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=56.0s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=58.0s)]
*  We're not here. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=59.0s)]
*  We're not here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=60.0s)]
*  We are in the state. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=61.0s)]
*  I bet a few more people in this [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=63.0s)]
*  room. We are not here. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=64.0s)]
*  Without the guarantee of the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=67.0s)]
*  14th amendment. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=69.0s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=70.0s)]
*  Immigration and Politics [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=74.0s)]
*  reporter Camilo Montoya Galvez. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=76.0s)]
*  Welcome in Camilo. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=77.0s)]
*  So what can you tell us about [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=78.0s)]
*  today's hearing? What came out [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=79.0s)]
*  of it? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=83.0s)]
*  a third nationwide injunction blocking President Trump's attempt to deny birthright citizenship [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=84.0s)]
*  to the children of parents who are in the country illegally or on temporary visas. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=90.96s)]
*  And this is, again, one of more than half a dozen lawsuits that states, localities, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=97.1s)]
*  advocates, and others have been filing across the U.S. challenging the legality of President [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=103.8s)]
*  Trump's action, which would empower the State Department and other agencies to deny birthright [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=110.12s)]
*  citizenship to children born under these circumstances. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  And of course, they argue that the president simply does not have the authority, Mugu, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  to essentially reinterpret the longstanding interpretation of the U.S. Constitution, which [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=125.56s)]
*  has long been interpreted to mean that if you are born here physically on U.S. soil, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=131.58s)]
*  an American citizen at birth, irrespective of the immigration status of your parents. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=137.06s)]
*  And so this will continue to be an intensifying legal battle that will play out in courts [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=141.70000000000002s)]
*  across the country. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=146.42000000000002s)]
*  But the Justice Department has already appealed the order in Washington State, and so this [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=147.98000000000002s)]
*  case could be decided by appellate courts and ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court too. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=153.14000000000001s)]
*  And so Camilo, in the last few days, federal judges in Seattle and Maryland issued nationwide [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=159.02s)]
*  injunctions in separate cases against President Trump's order. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=164.85999999999999s)]
*  So can you go over those rulings and exactly what happens next here? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=168.73999999999998s)]
*  Yes, some of these rulings were really scathing in nature, saying that the president is essentially [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=174.01999999999998s)]
*  flouting the U.S. Constitution and trampling on the longstanding interpretation of that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=180.7s)]
*  historical document. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=187.29999999999998s)]
*  And they are siding with the states and advocates who say that denying birthright citizenship [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=189.3s)]
*  to anyone who is born here on American soil is just simply illegal and unconstitutional. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=195.7s)]
*  And I actually, if I may, want to read you a quote from one of the rulings yesterday [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=202.1s)]
*  in Seattle by a judge appointed by former President Ronald Reagan. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=207.3s)]
*  And he said that citizenship by birth is an unequivocal constitutional right. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=213.14s)]
*  It is one of the precious principles that makes the United States the great nation that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=220.14s)]
*  it is. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=224.66s)]
*  The president cannot change, limit, or qualify this constitutional right via an executive [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=225.66s)]
*  order. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=232.26s)]
*  So some pretty scathing and clear language here from the judge in Seattle, again, appointed [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=233.26s)]
*  by a Republican president. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=240.1s)]
*  Camille, let's switch gears here. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=242.57999999999998s)]
*  I want to ask you about immigrant detainees in Guantanamo Bay. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=243.98s)]
*  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem plans to visit today. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=247.46s)]
*  So what exactly is she planning to do there? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=251.29999999999998s)]
*  Well, right now the Trump administration is in the process of repurposing the Guantanamo [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=254.62s)]
*  Bay Naval Base into a large-scale immigration detention center. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=261.74s)]
*  The president is saying that this detention facility in Cuba will be used to house the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=267.3s)]
*  worst of the worst, as he calls them, of people who are in the country illegally. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=272.98s)]
*  And so far we have seen two military aircraft land at Guantanamo Bay carrying about two [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=277.38s)]
*  dozen Venezuelan migrants who, U.S. officials say, are members of the notorious prison gang [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=283.86s)]
*  Tren de Agua, which the president has already moved to designate as a foreign terrorist [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=289.94s)]
*  organization. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=294.78s)]
*  And so they have become really a focal point of his sweeping and dramatic crackdown on [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=295.9s)]
*  illegal immigration. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=301.17999999999995s)]
*  But we are now told that U.S. officials are planning to send daily flights to Guantanamo [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=302.7s)]
*  Bay to send detainees there from across the U.S., from the U.S. mainland. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=308.38s)]
*  And so this really illustrates, Mugu, how aggressively and quickly the administration [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=313.7s)]
*  is moving to fulfill the president's demand and, again, convert this facility into one [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=319.41999999999996s)]
*  of the largest immigration detention centers across the country. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=325.38s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=328.94s)]
*  CBS News, immigration and politics reporter Canila Montoya-Galvez, thank you so much for [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=329.94s)]
*  your time today. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf_4xzC-PCE&t=334.21999999999997s)]
