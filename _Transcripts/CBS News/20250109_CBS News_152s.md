**CBS News:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8)

*  under a winter storm warning. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Communities bracing for freezing [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=10.84s)]
*  rain and icy roads. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=12.18s)]
*  I have a sister in Texas. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=13.48s)]
*  She said, why is it snowing here [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=15.4s)]
*  where usually it does not snow? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=17.48s)]
*  Some areas gearing up for as much [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=19.52s)]
*  as 9 inches of the white stuff. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=21.72s)]
*  So senior NBC CBS CBS News [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=23.84s)]
*  correspondent Jason Allen Boy, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=25.6s)]
*  Jason CBS Jason Allen joining us [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  live from Fort Worth. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=29.22s)]
*  Tell us what you are seeing on the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=30.34s)]
*  ground there my friend and what is [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=32.339999999999996s)]
*  the reason we are seeing snow in [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=34.28s)]
*  the Lone Star state? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=36.06s)]
*  Read your your sister's reaction is [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=39.1s)]
*  the same one that just about everybody [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=40.82s)]
*  has here when we get weather like this. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=42.82s)]
*  It is that unusual. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=45.06s)]
*  In fact, it's been four years since [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=46.099999999999994s)]
*  we saw more than two inches of snow [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=47.86s)]
*  in this area and now some areas [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=50.019999999999996s)]
*  forecast to get three times as much [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  as that four times as much of that. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=53.94s)]
*  So what we're getting right now [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=56.019999999999996s)]
*  is the same situation in Fort [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=57.56s)]
*  Worth and it's the same situation [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=59.36s)]
*  to the east in Dallas were right [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=61.1s)]
*  on that dividing line between rain [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=62.96s)]
*  and sleet and snow so can kind of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=64.68s)]
*  hear it right now the ice particles [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=66.68s)]
*  that are bouncing off my jacket. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=68.56s)]
*  But you can see it's enough that [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  is collecting in the streets here. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=72.08s)]
*  I'm going to go over here just to [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=73.6s)]
*  the grass because you can see it [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=75.44s)]
*  sort of piling up in the grass and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=77.2s)]
*  you get a sense when you pick it up, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=79.28s)]
*  right? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  This is that really wet, icy, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  thick kind of snow, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=83.56s)]
*  and so that's developing right now. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=84.64s)]
*  All across this region and we're [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=86.52s)]
*  really just in the first few hours of it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=88.16s)]
*  Alright, so what does it mean for [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=90.56s)]
*  drivers out there on the roads? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't look like there's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=92.84s)]
*  many people out right now. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=94.0s)]
*  No, there aren't many people out. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=96.0s)]
*  I want to go back to the roadway [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=97.36s)]
*  since you asked about it because [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=98.96s)]
*  it is the roadway that is really [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=100.44s)]
*  the biggest concern right now [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=102.08s)]
*  for public officials. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=103.44s)]
*  Look down this roadway. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  You see tire tracks. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  Do you see any signs that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=106.52s)]
*  plows have been here? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=107.88s)]
*  No, no, you don't. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=108.84s)]
*  And that's because we just don't [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=109.96s)]
*  have the infrastructure for that here. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  The very few plow attachments that they have. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=112.92s)]
*  They are focused on those critical facilities, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=115.4s)]
*  keeping hospital entrances clear, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=117.48s)]
*  public safety entrances clear. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=119.28s)]
*  Then they maybe get to some of the hills [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=120.96s)]
*  and some of the critical intersections [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  around the area. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=124.48s)]
*  But that's the biggest concern [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=125.52s)]
*  of people getting stranded on the roadways. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=126.72s)]
*  The state has brought more resources [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=128.36s)]
*  up from the South just to try to spread [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=129.92s)]
*  across those interstates in those critical areas. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=132.32s)]
*  Hopefully that's enough and it doesn't [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=134.68s)]
*  get bad enough out here that anybody [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=137.0s)]
*  ends up in that situation where [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=139.12s)]
*  they're stranded in this weather. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=140.44s)]
*  Hopefully everybody stays safe. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=141.76s)]
*  $50 if you post on social media Jason, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=143.28s)]
*  you doing a snow angel. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=145.88s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us on CBS News 24 seven. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNLJFACTXj8&t=147.76s)]
