# Takeaways from Trump's joint address to Congress
**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q)
*  And that appears to conclude an hour and 40 some odd minute speech by the president. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=0.0s)]
*  It's the longest speech of its kind. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=7.36s)]
*  President Trump moved through a flurry of the actions he's taken in the first 43 days [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=9.48s)]
*  of his administration, deportations, tariffs, ending environmental regulations, reinstating [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=13.92s)]
*  merit-based hiring, revoking diversity and inclusion measures. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=19.88s)]
*  He blamed the Biden administration at several turns in a way the presidents don't usually [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=25.060000000000002s)]
*  make in these kinds of speech. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=29.52s)]
*  He praised Elon Musk and the efforts of his department. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=30.96s)]
*  And I would say just as a final note, he gave the speech to half the room, the Republican [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=36.04s)]
*  half tilting his body because the Democrats were having none of it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=40.76s)]
*  But as a final note, I note that while voters say that lowering prices is their key issue, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=46.28s)]
*  it was arguably the thing that got him elected, he spent very little of the speech on that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=51.36s)]
*  And indeed, he devoted more direct attention and detail to the issue, to transgender issues [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  than he did to lowering consumer prices. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=63.68s)]
*  Right you are, John. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=66.92s)]
*  Couple thoughts here. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=68.44s)]
*  How'd you like to be Alyssa Slotkin tonight? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=69.44s)]
*  The Michigan senator is set to give the Democratic response. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=71.72s)]
*  She's been waiting, I'm going to guess, impatiently because she's going to go next and it's going [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=74.36s)]
*  to be late and fewer people will see it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=78.8s)]
*  The divide in American politics on full display three minutes after he declared that America [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=81.36s)]
*  is back, Democrats started booing and yelling. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=86.4s)]
*  And that's when Congressman Al Green, Democrat of Texas, was then singled out as being too [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=89.72s)]
*  loud and out of order and unruly. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=95.72s)]
*  And so the speaker ordered him removed just in an unbelievable moment. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=98.02000000000001s)]
*  I mean, you remember when Obama was speaking back in 08 and back then the the congressman [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=103.0s)]
*  from South Carolina, Joe Wilson, yelled out, Joe Wilson yelled out, you lie. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=109.72s)]
*  And we were all shocked by that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  Trump kept going, didn't miss a beat and continued to list his laundry list of accomplishments. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=115.48s)]
*  And as you say, John, he didn't say that much about the economy. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=120.68s)]
*  You're going to have to wonder if that was a missed opportunity. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=123.48s)]
*  Face the Nation moderator, Margaret Brennan is here. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=127.2s)]
*  Well, John and Maurice, this really felt like a campaign rally speech, more slogan than [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=129.96s)]
*  substantive policy, even down to referring to Joe Biden as the worst president in history. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=136.88s)]
*  You were very diplomatic, John, when you said words that you don't often hear in these chambers [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  like that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=147.6s)]
*  These were very raucous lawmakers. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  The Democratic side thinly attended. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=150.68s)]
*  You saw pink shirts. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=152.72s)]
*  You saw signs up protesting Elon Musk mentioning cuts to Medicaid. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=154.14s)]
*  That's a reference to a fight in Congress they're about to have over spending and cuts [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=158.32s)]
*  to come. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=163.72s)]
*  He also in his speech, the president did ask on the economic front, American farmers to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=164.72s)]
*  bear with him a reference there to the terror fight that may escalate with China, Canada [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=170.0s)]
*  and Mexico. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=176.0s)]
*  He referred to the Afghanistan withdrawal that he negotiated by saying that he has gotten [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=177.48s)]
*  Pakistan to agree to send one of the terrorists who carried it out here. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=182.8s)]
*  He had a number of announcements like that calling people out in the audience, always [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=186.48s)]
*  the showman. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=191.52s)]
*  And he did that here tonight. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=192.88s)]
*  But he also, interestingly, made some policy announcements. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=194.66s)]
*  He said he wants to repeal this bipartisan bill that has this massive investment in computer [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=197.66s)]
*  chips, things that have to do with competition with China. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=202.02s)]
*  It was interesting that he chose in the chamber tonight to go there. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=204.82s)]
*  Wondering what it was like on the floor tonight. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=208.38s)]
*  Scott McFarland, you are there. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=210.46s)]
*  Give us a peek, Scott. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=212.64s)]
*  Maurice, it was a horribly tense feeling in this chamber at moments after Congressman [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=213.94s)]
*  Green of Houston was ejected. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=220.82s)]
*  There was this loud, visceral, ugly screaming inside the chamber directed at Mr. Green, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=223.0s)]
*  then directed between both parties and each other. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=228.92s)]
*  There was another moment when Congresswoman Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico was holding [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=231.9s)]
*  up a white sign that said, this is not normal. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=236.72s)]
*  A Republican snatched the paper from her hand and threw it across the room. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=240.1s)]
*  And then there were the protests from some House Democrats. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=244.88s)]
*  One after another, they walked out mid-speech. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=248.74s)]
*  At some point, some of them turned their backs on the president, waited there a moment, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=251.44s)]
*  then departed. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=256.48s)]
*  Among those who left, Maxwell Frost of Florida, Jasmine Crockett of Texas. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=257.48s)]
*  But also, there were those empty seats that were so noticeable as the protests continued. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=261.52s)]
*  And John, Maurice, and Margaret, first time I can remember a State of the Union where [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=267.08s)]
*  the minority party didn't stand once for anything. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=270.84s)]
*  Scott McFarland there reporting from the hall. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=277.52s)]
*  It was also notable, Scott, since you've covered the January 6th prosecutions and also [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=280.24s)]
*  the fallout from it, that the president spoke at length about trusting and protecting law [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=287.12s)]
*  enforcement officers. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  He, of course, pardoning those in the January 6th attack on the Capitol that attacked officers [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=293.96000000000004s)]
*  as well. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=301.08s)]
*  The president... [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=302.08s)]
*  He's about to walk out the door that those rioters tried to enter January 6, 2021. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=303.08s)]
*  He's about to walk out that very door. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=307.72s)]
*  The president mentioned his predecessor a lot during the congressional address, and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=309.56s)]
*  Weijia Zhang is at the White House. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=313.76000000000005s)]
*  This was as much of a campaign speech as you can have in that, or at least as we've ever [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=316.84000000000003s)]
*  seen in that venue. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=323.94000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, there were so many points, John, where he sounded like candidate Trump and not President [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=325.96000000000004s)]
*  Trump. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=332.12s)]
*  He's about to lay the blame on the Biden administration to explain why we are in this situation with [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=334.12s)]
*  the economy. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=339.92s)]
*  His advisors have been saying, we've only been here for six weeks. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  But the real issue here is what he is going to do about it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=345.08s)]
*  And White House officials said that Trump would lay out a specific plan and talk about [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=349.72s)]
*  all the things that his team would be doing to bring down prices. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=354.2s)]
*  But the things he talked about were things that were not new and things that require [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=358.36s)]
*  time. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=362.92s)]
*  And we know that when it comes to economic policy, time is not on a president's side [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=364.28000000000003s)]
*  when people are expecting immediate relief. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=368.68s)]
*  So he talked about domestic energy production. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=371.6s)]
*  He talked about waste, fraud, and abuse. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=374.12s)]
*  And he talked about dealing with the bird flu. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=376.24s)]
*  But John, he did not really answer what he's doing right now to bring down the prices. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=378.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=384.88s)]
*  Weijia Zhang at the White House. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=385.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=386.88s)]
*  And coming up, the Democratic response to the president's address to Congress. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=387.88s)]
*  You are watching CBS News. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPz7IT247Q&t=391.08s)]
