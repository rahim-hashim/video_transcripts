# What to know about Pam Bondi and Marco Rubio's Senate confirmation hearings
**CBS News:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM)
*  We begin on Capitol Hill where confirmation hearings for President-elect Donald Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=0.0s)]
*  cabinet picks are ramping up today with several top positions under the spotlight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=5.2s)]
*  Attorney General nominee Pam Bondi, her hearing is in full swing. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Let's step in for just a bit. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=13.3s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi will restore law and order to the nation. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=15.92s)]
*  She'll put Americans' interests first and make the nation a better and safer place. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=19.52s)]
*  I urge every single member of this committee to support my friend Pam Bondi. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=24.04s)]
*  I look forward to voting for her confirmation soon on the Senate floor and help her get [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=28.48s)]
*  to work for the American people. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=32.4s)]
*  Thank you, Chairman. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=34.16s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Durbin, and members of the committee. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=35.16s)]
*  It is an honor for me and a privilege to introduce Pam Bondi, President Trump's nominee to be [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=45.84s)]
*  the 87th Attorney General of the United States. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=51.08s)]
*  I have known and worked closely with Pam for years, and I'm glad to call her a friend. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=53.84s)]
*  When Pam was nominated by President Trump, my reaction was, this is a home run. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=59.64s)]
*  As many of us are, I was only to be outdone by Senator Graham, who described the nomination [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=64.80000000000001s)]
*  as a grand slam, touchdown, hole-in-one, ace, hat-trick, slam dunk, Olympic gold medal pick, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=70.08000000000001s)]
*  and he's right. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=75.48s)]
*  As the letter joined by more than 100 former Justice Department officials put it, quote, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=78.4s)]
*  it's all too rare for senior Justice Department officials, much less attorneys general, to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=83.52s)]
*  have such a wealth of experience in the day-to-day work of keeping our communities safe, end [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=87.92s)]
*  quote. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=93.08s)]
*  Pam exemplifies and personifies the Department of Justice's mission to uphold the rule of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=94.08s)]
*  law, to keep our communities safe, and to protect our rights and liberties as Americans. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=99.88s)]
*  Pam has distinguished herself in her career in public service that has taken her from [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=105.88s)]
*  her small town upbringing in Temple Terrace, Florida, to a hearing before this esteemed [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=110.76s)]
*  committee. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=115.76s)]
*  After attending the University of Florida and Stetson University College of Law, she [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=117.76s)]
*  started her career as a local prosecutor in Hillsborough County, Florida. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=120.72000000000001s)]
*  As a local prosecutor for nearly two decades, Pam kept her community safe, prosecuting violent [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  criminals, drug dealers, those who had threatened the local community, and those who stood in [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=131.16s)]
*  opposition to the rule of law. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  Pam's fellow Floridians then elected her to serve as Florida's Attorney General, where [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=139.28s)]
*  she was the first woman in state history elected to that office. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=143.28s)]
*  As a former state attorney general myself, I can vouch for the deep experience that Pam [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=148.08s)]
*  Bondi has developed from serving in that role. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=153.44s)]
*  As the chief law enforcement official in her state, she worked with local prosecutors to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=156.56s)]
*  fight crime, work to protect our constitutional rights. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=161.68s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=165.04s)]
*  We're just dipping in there as Pam Bondi begins her hearing for attorney general. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=166.04s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News congressional correspondent Scott McFarland to talk more [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=169.12s)]
*  about this. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=172.6s)]
*  Scott, as you know, Pam Bondi has quite a high level of favorability among the Republican [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=174.0s)]
*  majority for the nation's top prosecutor. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=181.12s)]
*  So what kind of tough questions, if any, can we expect? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=184.6s)]
*  Because even some Democrats, I'm guessing, will have, it won't be as controversial as [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=187.76s)]
*  the hearing that we saw yesterday for Pete Hegseth, but still tough. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=193.22s)]
*  So what do we expect? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=196.98s)]
*  The Democrats have shown their roadmap through what Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois said [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=198.85999999999999s)]
*  a few minutes ago. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=202.89999999999998s)]
*  They're going to question her on her role in trying to overturn the results of the 2020 [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=203.89999999999998s)]
*  election. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=208.82s)]
*  She was a close ally of Donald Trump during that process between Election Day and Inauguration [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=209.82s)]
*  Day 2021. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=214.85999999999999s)]
*  She was part of the effort to overturn the results in Pennsylvania. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=215.85999999999999s)]
*  She's going to be asked about that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=218.82s)]
*  I suspect she'll also be pressed, Vlad, as to whether she still believes these false [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=220.9s)]
*  claims of the rigging of the 2020 election and her thoughts on January 6th. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=226.5s)]
*  How aligned is she with Donald Trump on denying the U.S. Capitol riot? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=231.26s)]
*  These may not detour or derail her nomination, but Democrats want her to speak to this today [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=236.94s)]
*  as they prepare for the next Trump administration. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=243.14s)]
*  This is custom, Vlad, to have two introducers for nominees. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=246.54s)]
*  You first heard from Rick Scott, the junior senator from Florida. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=250.34s)]
*  Eric Schmidt, who was a former attorney general of the state of Missouri, is now the senator [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=254.38s)]
*  from the state of Missouri. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=259.4s)]
*  He's actually introducing her from the dais because he's a member of the Judiciary Committee. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=260.4s)]
*  It's going to be a long hearing, Vlad. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=265.22s)]
*  There's one particular questioner I'm waiting for at the very end. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=267.42s)]
*  California Senator Adam Schiff, new to the Senate. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=272.74s)]
*  He was part of that House January 6th Select Committee. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=275.82s)]
*  He investigated the insurrection. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=278.5s)]
*  He has a chance to ask her questions about that after she takes questions after her opening [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=280.94s)]
*  statement, which appears poised to begin. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=286.18s)]
*  Senator Schmidt, he's the one, Scott, who yesterday during that hearing for Pete Hegseth [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=290.5s)]
*  talked about incompetence in the military but spelled military wrong. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=295.1s)]
*  Is that the senator you're referring to? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=298.46s)]
*  Eric Schmidt is one of the most closely aligned Trump allies in the U.S. Senate. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=301.66s)]
*  His name was actually floated early in the process as a possible candidate to be attorney [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=307.65999999999997s)]
*  general, but no surprise he introduced Pam Bondi. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=311.18s)]
*  They are very close as former state attorneys general. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=313.8s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=317.74s)]
*  Let's listen in to Pam Bondi is what I'm being told from the control room, Scott. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=320.65999999999997s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=323.38s)]
*  I have the opportunity to meet with almost all of you and I greatly appreciate that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=324.38s)]
*  I'm grateful to President Trump and to this committee for your consideration to be the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=330.65999999999997s)]
*  87th Attorney General of the United States. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=336.21999999999997s)]
*  I would not be here without my family. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=341.06s)]
*  And if you can bear with me for just a moment, a lot of them have made a very long trip and [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=344.82s)]
*  I wrote them all down so I don't forget anyone. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=349.62s)]
*  My beautiful mother, I wouldn't be here, retired kindergarten teacher, would not be here without [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=353.21999999999997s)]
*  my mom. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=360.02s)]
*  Because of a week ago, it was 12 years since we lost my dad to leukemia, feels like 12 [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=361.8s)]
*  days. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=366.44000000000005s)]
*  My amazing husband, John, and his two incredible girls, Collins and Finley. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=368.28000000000003s)]
*  Collins is a senior at University of Florida and I think all of you on this committee will [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=375.72s)]
*  be very happy to know Finley is in cyber security. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=379.64000000000004s)]
*  There's a third who is traveling abroad. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=385.76000000000005s)]
*  I wish she could be here. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=387.8s)]
*  My amazing father-in-law, David. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=389.62s)]
*  My sister, Beth. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=392.74s)]
*  My brother-in-law is home with my niece. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=395.38s)]
*  My nephews, if you could just raise your hand. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=398.1s)]
*  All right, Pam Bondi there preparing for her confirmation hearing, shouting out members [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=401.66s)]
*  of her family as each nominee typically does. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=405.7s)]
*  Let's go back to Scott McFarland who's tracking developments on the Hill for us. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=409.3s)]
*  Scott, let's talk about Marco Rubio. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=412.74s)]
*  It seems to be a fairly non-controversial choice for Secretary of State. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=415.97999999999996s)]
*  What's the vibe with Democrats and Marco Rubio? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=422.82s)]
*  I know that he's a former never Trump return, big time Trump supporter, but what is his [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=425.73999999999995s)]
*  relationship with Democrats in the Senate? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=431.78s)]
*  This is a whole different dynamic, this particular choice, Vlad. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=435.02s)]
*  Imagine going for a job interview at a new company across the country. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=438.58s)]
*  Imagine going for a job interview in your own office with your own colleagues and your [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=442.34s)]
*  own boss. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=446.82s)]
*  That's the dynamic Marco Rubio faces because he is seeking the confirmation of his own [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=448.26s)]
*  colleagues in the U.S. Senate, some of whom he's built some particularly strong relationships [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=452.46s)]
*  with. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=457.02s)]
*  He's actually been a top Republican on one of the more bipartisan panels, the Senate [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=458.02s)]
*  Intelligence Committee. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=461.5s)]
*  Easy to form bipartisan relationships there. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=463.17999999999995s)]
*  He's going to benefit from that during this process. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=465.41999999999996s)]
*  He will sit before the senators over whom he has seniority in some cases. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=468.42s)]
*  This will be arguably or potentially, Vlad, the lowest stress, lowest drama of all Senate [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=473.38s)]
*  confirmation hearings this week. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=480.98s)]
*  Alright, and we'll be watching Scott McFarland for us. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=482.94s)]
*  Thank you, Scott. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=485.86s)]
*  Appreciate you. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK7L7rMdIM&t=486.86s)]
