# New Mexico adult dies amid growing measles outbreak
**CBS News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA)
*  A New Mexico adult who tested positive for measles has died, marking a second death related [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=0.0s)]
*  to the growing outbreak in the U.S. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  The person did not receive medical care and was not vaccinated. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=7.44s)]
*  According to New Mexico health officials, as of Friday, the CDC reported more than 220 [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=10.52s)]
*  measles cases across 12 states, although most of the cases are centered around the Texas-New [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=15.52s)]
*  Mexico area. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=20.52s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Omar Villafranca has more on the outbreak. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=21.52s)]
*  The latest numbers for the Texas measles outbreak came out and the state is now at [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=26.26s)]
*  198 confirmed cases, a majority of them 137 in far west Texas in Gaines County. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=30.42s)]
*  And the state says that it's a small Mennonite community there that is really being impacted. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=38.260000000000005s)]
*  Now we were in Gaines County and talked to a doctor at Seminole Hospital, Seminole Memorial [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=43.660000000000004s)]
*  Hospital there, who's treated the Mennonite community there for years. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=48.88s)]
*  He said it's hitting the children there, unvaccinated children in that Mennonite community, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=52.94s)]
*  the hardest. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=59.3s)]
*  And he said, you know, of course, as a doctor, he wants to build a relationship with his [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=60.3s)]
*  patients and he's had the conversations about getting the measles vaccine. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=63.5s)]
*  But he points that these are hardworking people, but they're very weary of Western medicine. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=67.66s)]
*  And he says it's just not going to happen. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=72.06s)]
*  That's something that, of course, he has to deal with there being on the front lines. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=75.8s)]
*  What was interesting in our conversation with him is that he's been working for almost 30 [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=79.69999999999999s)]
*  years in far west Texas and he has never seen a measles case until this year. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=84.1s)]
*  So of course, a lot of the physicians in the area are trying to work through that, what [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=90.3s)]
*  that means. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=94.3s)]
*  There has been one death in the state of Texas, an unvaccinated child of school age. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=95.74s)]
*  Also, New Mexico reported in Lee County, which is just over the border from Texas, one death [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=101.25999999999999s)]
*  there, an unvaccinated adult. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=108.89999999999999s)]
*  We don't know if it's a male or female and it's or if it's directly related to the outbreak [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=111.02s)]
*  in West Texas. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=115.1s)]
*  But right now, two deaths have been reported. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=116.1s)]
*  This is a story that is developing and is updated weekly. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=118.97999999999999s)]
*  So we'll keep an eye on it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=122.22s)]
*  But doctors say they're very aware and keeping an eye on it and see how it spreads across [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=124.05999999999999s)]
*  the state. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=128.18s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=129.18s)]
*  Oh, Marvina Franca, thank you. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT8iwniMzuA&t=130.18s)]
