# How Ukrainians are reacting to the three-year mark since Russia's invasion
**CBS News:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc)
*  Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky says he is willing to step down in exchange for peace and NATO membership for his country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=0.0s)]
*  This comes as Russia and the US have agreed to start working toward ending the war. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=8.0s)]
*  On Face the Nation, President Trump's special envoy to the Middle East spoke about his meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin earlier this month. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=12.0s)]
*  Trust building begins with good proper communication. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=20.0s)]
*  We just had a great discussion being President Putin and now it will be up to President Putin and President Trump to work something out. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=24.0s)]
*  I think they are going to be successful. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=36.0s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent M.T.S. Tyab joins us now from Ukraine with more on all of this. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=38.0s)]
*  M.T.S. earlier this hour we got a perspective from Odessa. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=44.0s)]
*  So I'm curious, what are you hearing from people in Ukraine about this pivotal moment? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=47.0s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=52.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're in Borodnanka, which is a suburb of Kiev. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=53.0s)]
*  And this is a place that knows war. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=57.0s)]
*  It was one of the places that was heavily targeted by Vladimir Putin's forces three years ago. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=60.0s)]
*  And you can see the devastation to what was once a residential building. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=66.0s)]
*  We spoke to a woman named Lillia who lived in this area. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=70.0s)]
*  Her home is no longer livable. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=74.0s)]
*  She's living in a temporary shelter, a tiny residential building. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=76.0s)]
*  She's living in a temporary shelter, a tiny room. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=81.0s)]
*  And I asked her, how are you feeling in this moment three years into this brutal war where her husband is serving on the front lines? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=84.0s)]
*  And she said all she knows is that she wants it to end. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=92.0s)]
*  And we know M.T.S. is jarring to see that destruction around you. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=96.0s)]
*  I just want to acknowledge you've got dozens of world leaders in Kiev today showing their support for Ukraine and for people like the woman you spoke with [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=102.0s)]
*  discussing security guarantees. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=110.0s)]
*  But what is the expectation of what might come out of today's meetings? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=112.0s)]
*  Yeah, we have the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau here. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=118.0s)]
*  We have several European leaders as well really showing this support for Ukraine to travel all the way to a war zone. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=121.0s)]
*  Frankly, Errol, to stand in solidarity with President Zelensky, who himself has said that he hopes this would be a, quote, turning point. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=128.0s)]
*  But of course, notably absent is President Trump. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=136.0s)]
*  And we all know over the past week, both President Trump and even Mr. Zelensky himself traded broadsides with each other. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=139.0s)]
*  Mr. Trump calling him a dictator, at one point accusing Ukraine of starting the war, which of course we know is not true. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=147.0s)]
*  And it really just signals this downturn in relation. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=154.0s)]
*  Still, I was at a press conference yesterday with Mr. Zelensky, and he said that he was hopeful things could turn around. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=158.0s)]
*  And in his words, he said, because whether he liked it or not, Ukraine needs America. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=164.0s)]
*  MTS, I have that live report out of Borodoyanka, Ukraine. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=169.0s)]
*  MTS, thank you very much for that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O30ExerNLKc&t=173.0s)]
