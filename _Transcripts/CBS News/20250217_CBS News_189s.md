# Trump administration fires thousands of U.S. Forest and National Park Service workers
**CBS News:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ)
*  The U.S. Forest and National Park Services were hit with major staffing cuts over the weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=0.0s)]
*  The administration fired about 3,400 recent or probationary hires with the U.S. Forest Service, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=5.0s)]
*  meaning they were within the first year or two of employment. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=11.5s)]
*  That's about 10% of its workforce. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=14.5s)]
*  About 1,000 or 5% of National Park Service employees have also been let go. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=17.0s)]
*  Popular tourist sites such as the Appalachian Trail, Yellowstone, Yosemite, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=22.0s)]
*  and the Sequoia National Forest have been affected. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=26.0s)]
*  The National Parks Conservation Association, a nonpartisan advocacy group, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=29.0s)]
*  says the cuts will, quote, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=33.0s)]
*  leave parks understaffed, facing tough questions about operating hours, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=35.0s)]
*  public safety, and resource protection. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=39.0s)]
*  Let's bring in Ashley Harrell. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=42.0s)]
*  She's the National Parks Bureau Chief at SFGate. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=44.0s)]
*  She recently wrote an article about how these staff cuts have been impacting Yosemite specifically, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=47.0s)]
*  with really a pretty startling headline there talking about the chaos that's currently unfolding. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=52.0s)]
*  Ashley, great article. Thank you for being here. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=57.0s)]
*  Sources tell you 4% of Yosemite's staff, all probationary, have been terminated. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=60.0s)]
*  Since your article came out last week, what positions are impacted? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=64.0s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for having me. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=70.0s)]
*  So I think first it's important to note that National Parks are perpetually underfunded and understaffed, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=72.0s)]
*  and Yosemite's no exception. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=79.0s)]
*  The park has been operating at less than full staffing for years, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=82.0s)]
*  and only has about 1,200 employees to begin with. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=85.0s)]
*  So typically in the spring and summer when park visitation skyrockets, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=88.0s)]
*  Yosemite brings in 350 to 400 employees to maintain order and take care of the parks and take care of the visitors. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=92.0s)]
*  And that hiring process starts six months in advance. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=101.0s)]
*  So this year, as those people were being hired, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=105.0s)]
*  Trump's hiring freeze triggered multiple rounds of seasonal job offers being rescinded at Yosemite [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=109.0s)]
*  and across the National Parks system. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=115.0s)]
*  And that affected everyone from maintenance workers to interpretive rangers to law enforcement rangers to fee technicians. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=117.0s)]
*  Those are the people who collect your money at the gate. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=125.0s)]
*  So Ashley, you write that as many as 20,000 visitors a day during peak season go to Yosemite. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=127.0s)]
*  What would, if I bring my family, what might I experience on my vacation this year that might be different from past years? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=133.0s)]
*  Am I waiting in the car longer to get in? Am I walking a few extra miles to throw something away? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=139.0s)]
*  Sure, yeah. So basically we're looking at a spring and summer where tens of thousands of people are showing up to the park each day, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=147.0s)]
*  waiting three or four hours to get in, then getting stuck in traffic once they're inside, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=156.0s)]
*  not finding places to park. And, you know, the reservation system that is normally in place during the summertime is possibly not coming back this year. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=161.0s)]
*  That's been very effective in managing crowds and protecting park resources. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=171.0s)]
*  And right now we're waiting on the Trump administration to say whether it's going to happen. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=175.0s)]
*  But insiders are saying it's unlikely. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=179.0s)]
*  All right, Ashley Harrell, we'll be following your reporting and hope to have you back. Thank you. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=182.0s)]
*  Yeah, thanks so much. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2HGuZ4QjQQ&t=187.0s)]
