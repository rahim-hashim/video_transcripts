# Early details on investigation into D.C. midair plane crash
**CBS News:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY)
*  I'm Errol Barnett at the CBS broadcast center in New York. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=0.0s)]
*  There are questions this morning as to how a mid-air collision in the nation's capital, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=4.2s)]
*  which the Department of Transportation secretary says was completely preventable, happened. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=9.88s)]
*  CBS News congressional correspondent Caitlin Huey-Burns joins us from Reagan National Airport [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=15.0s)]
*  where one aircraft was heading toward before this mid-air collision. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=20.68s)]
*  Caitlin, what do we know at this early stage about what the key focus is to figure out how it happened? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=25.36s)]
*  Well, Errol, what we know now, unfortunately, is that this has moved from a rescue operation to a recovery operation. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=35.24s)]
*  Unfortunately, officials here just a few moments ago said that they don't believe there are any survivors from this crash. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=42.92s)]
*  And so now this will go under the jurisdiction of the NTSB. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=50.56s)]
*  And what that looks like remains to be seen in terms of the timeline. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=55.6s)]
*  But here are a couple of takeaways from this press conference and things that we want to know moving forward. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=60.68000000000001s)]
*  I asked officials here just moments ago, can you guarantee that Americans are safe to fly? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=66.48s)]
*  Remember, this airport is set to open again at 11, just a few hours from now. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=73.16s)]
*  And officials said that they don't have any indications to suggest otherwise. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=78.48s)]
*  We also heard from the new secretary of transportation, Sean Duffy, who says that he agrees with President Trump that this could have been prevented. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=83.88s)]
*  So that is kind of the key question for investigators and, quite frankly, for lawmakers on Capitol Hill. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=93.32s)]
*  They're going to have that those same questions as well. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=100.96s)]
*  How could this have been prevented? Now, we are at the DCA airport. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=103.88s)]
*  This is actually technically in Virginia. And you saw members of the Virginia congressional delegation. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=107.92s)]
*  I'm keeping an eye out for Senator Mark Warner, who said that he will come over and talk to me just in a few moments after he's wrapping up another interview. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  So we have some questions about what congressional oversight is. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=122.92s)]
*  But, Erroll, as you know, on a typical Thursday here in Washington at this particular airport, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  this is usually flooded with lawmakers trying to catch flights home. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=133.4s)]
*  This is a very convenient airport for Washington residents, but also for lawmakers. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  They take flights out of here all the time. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  And they have also raised concerns, senators have, about the congestion at this airport. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=146.88000000000002s)]
*  So while we're waiting to hear answers to questions about how this could have happened in the air, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=153.0s)]
*  you've already had ongoing concerns from lawmakers who have been worried about the amount of flights that take off and land at this airport, given its size. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=159.48s)]
*  So that figures to be a continued line of questioning. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=172.16s)]
*  There's also a role for Congress here. Congress has oversight, particularly of the FAA and what's notable, Erroll, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  and I apologize if you've noted this already, but the FAA currently does not have an administrator. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=185.32s)]
*  That's a five year term. It's meant to exceed a president's term so that it's not a political position. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  The person who just occupied it just resigned ahead of his term ending. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=199.88s)]
*  And so there is a vacancy there that also raises some questions about who is having oversight when it comes to safety and everything related to aviation. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=204.56s)]
*  So those are lingering questions that lawmakers are likely to have, but that has also been kind of an ongoing concern, particularly at this airport. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=215.72s)]
*  And Caitlin, you're accurate to note that while Congress has oversight of this, because personally they fly in and out of this airport every week, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  they have a vested interest to get to the bottom of how such a routine flight for both the chopper and the jet could have resulted in a mid air collision. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=233.48s)]
*  Certainly, if Senator Werner approaches you, feel free to jump into your Q&A live with us. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=243.2s)]
*  But I do want to add that what they have in their favor, at the very least, is that they have the air traffic control recording where ATC confirms with the chopper to get a visual confirmation of the jet. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=248.08s)]
*  The chopper confirmed it and we will eventually have the black box, the data voice and data flight recorder from the jet at some point. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=259.88s)]
*  What then, when that information is gathered, do we expect them to do with it? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=270.03999999999996s)]
*  What could be an outcome here if it was as simple as a miscommunication from ATC to the black hawk chopper? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=275.0s)]
*  Yeah, and that's the biggest question here is what that communication was like, and especially since officials say that this could have been prevented. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=283.44s)]
*  I could also tell you, Errol, that I got to this airport at about two in the morning and family members of those who we now know are victims of this crash were gathered at the airport, waiting and wanting to know of word of their loved ones. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=292.32s)]
*  They were gathered in a, in a essentially an American Airlines lounge outside of our direct purview, but meeting with lawmakers here and I'm flagging Senator Warner down. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=311.28s)]
*  He's OK. He has to apologies for that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=325.08s)]
*  He has to had to a hearing over on Capitol Hill where no doubt this will be discussed upon Capitol Hill as well. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  But back to those family members, we could see at least through a window, family members gathered with officials in essentially a holding room that was the American Airlines lounge here at DCA Airport wanting to know more information. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=338.04s)]
*  I saw one woman enter the arrived at the airport at around three in the morning looking for word for from her friend who she believed to be on that flight. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=358.24s)]
*  Unfortunately, and as we know, as we just learned moments ago, there were no survivors believed to have come from this this flight. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=370.64s)]
*  So again, just to recap, a lot of questions about oversight here, a lot of questions about communication. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=380.52s)]
*  This now will be a very long story with lots and lots of tentacles. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=387.76000000000005s)]
*  Errol, of course, top of mind are those family members who have lost loved ones. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=393.0s)]
*  We don't have an official count, as as officials said. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=399.68s)]
*  But of course, that is top of mind. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=403.64000000000004s)]
*  And also how this could happen. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=405.56s)]
*  We heard from the transportation secretary that all of this was very routine, that you have military aircraft operating around. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  DC around this airport quite frequently. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=417.44s)]
*  You have a landing pattern. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=420.28s)]
*  This specific flight from Wichita to DCA has been in place for about a year. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=422.12s)]
*  And so that flight pattern has been in existence. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=428.84s)]
*  So everything, according to officials, looked normal. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=432.32s)]
*  So the question is, how could this have been avoided as they say it should have been? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=436.44s)]
*  And so many friends of victims, relatives, they are they had the desperate question this morning of what happened? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=442.2s)]
*  How can they know more? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=448.92s)]
*  And our hearts just go out to them and all relatives of this tragedy. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=450.96s)]
*  Caitlin Huey Burns joining us live from Reagan National Airport there just outside Washington, DC in Virginia. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=455.56s)]
*  Caitlin, thank you. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn-gCA2lUxY&t=462.15999999999997s)]
