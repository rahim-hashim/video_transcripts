# Transportation secretary says it's safe to fly after series of plane crashes
**CBS News:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw)
*  Now we can report on yet another deadly plane crash. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=0.0s)]
*  Two people have been killed after two small planes collided [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=4.0s)]
*  midair over Arizona yesterday. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=7.44s)]
*  You see the aftermath. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=9.44s)]
*  Officials said each plane had two people on board [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=10.8s)]
*  when they crashed at Marana Regional Airport. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=13.32s)]
*  This is just outside Tucson. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=15.84s)]
*  One of the planes hit the ground near a runway and caught fire. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=17.8s)]
*  The other aircraft landed safely. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=21.48s)]
*  The FAA says this regional airport does not have [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=23.84s)]
*  an air traffic control tower. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=26.6s)]
*  So pilots use a common radio channel to let each other know their position. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=28.32s)]
*  Delta Airlines is offering a payout now to the passengers who were on the flight [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=33.56s)]
*  that crashed in Toronto on Monday. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=37.28s)]
*  It's worth $30,000 and a spokesperson for Delta insists, quote, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=39.64s)]
*  this gesture has no strings attached and does not affect rights. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  The plane was flying into Toronto from Minneapolis. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=49.36s)]
*  As it tried to land, it flipped, injuring 21 people. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=51.92s)]
*  One passenger is still hospitalized. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=55.56s)]
*  The cause of that crash is under investigation. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=58.16s)]
*  And this crash happened three weeks after the midair collision [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=61.63999999999999s)]
*  over Washington, D.C., you'll remember, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=64.64s)]
*  and a string of other high-profile air incidents. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=66.96s)]
*  Our senior transportation correspondent, Chris Van Cleave, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  talked with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy about the safety of our skies. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=72.47999999999999s)]
*  If you get on a plane, if you look at how many people fly, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=77.56s)]
*  how many flights we have, of course it's a safe space. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=80.0s)]
*  I do think as we look at the incidents or the crashes, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=82.72s)]
*  it gives us an opportunity to say, what went wrong? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=85.44000000000001s)]
*  What can we improve upon in the system off these crashes? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  The systems that we use are so old. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  We should be the envy of the world, but that we have systems [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=95.12s)]
*  across our network that are run on floppy disks. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  Chris Van Cleave joins us now from our Washington bureau. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  Chris, great to have you get this access and to do this interview. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  What did Secretary Duffy say about plans to upgrade systems [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=109.04s)]
*  considering they use floppy disks? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=112.76s)]
*  Well, he's reached out to Elon Musk and sort of the aerospace industry [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=115.56s)]
*  for ideas on how they can update that piece. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=120.44s)]
*  He said, perhaps it's integrating AI, perhaps it's, you know, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=123.76s)]
*  moving to an Apple IIGS. I'm kidding. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=127.36s)]
*  But getting off the floppy disk system is certainly part of the plan there. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=129.2s)]
*  In fact, Musk and SpaceX engineers visited the FAA command center [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=133.44s)]
*  earlier this week and met with controllers. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=138.12s)]
*  We asked him about how do you guard against conflicts of interest [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=140.76s)]
*  since SpaceX is regulated by the FAA? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=144.56s)]
*  And he said this is not a situation where they're plugging into the system. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=147.04s)]
*  It was purely sort of getting some experience, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=150.36s)]
*  seeing what the controllers see and talking to controllers about their experience. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=153.52s)]
*  You know, that's sort of the first step in perhaps building a better user experience [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  for air traffic controllers. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=161.28s)]
*  And this is happening at a time when hundreds of FAA employees are being laid off. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=162.72s)]
*  What did Secretary Duffy say about that? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=167.64s)]
*  Yeah, so the secretary said it was a total of 352 people who were laid off. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=170.72s)]
*  It's the first time we'd heard an exact number. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=175.24s)]
*  That is, he says, about 0.8% of the FAA staff. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=177.56s)]
*  So a very small number. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  And he insisted that none of the positions were directly safety related. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=184.6s)]
*  In fact, he says they are continuing to hire safety related positions [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=189.0s)]
*  like inspectors, investigators and air traffic controllers. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=192.84s)]
*  And it was one of the big headline you looked into. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=196.36s)]
*  Yesterday, the Trump administration terminated the approval of New York City's [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=198.56s)]
*  congestion pricing plan. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=202.08s)]
*  And you asked Duffy about this. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=204.24s)]
*  Here's some of what he said. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=206.24s)]
*  I think it's a war on the working class Americans who work in that space. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=208.52s)]
*  And it's a favor to the rich people. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=212.72s)]
*  The rich people can pay the toll. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  It doesn't bother them. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=216.68s)]
*  And they get the, what, the poor people and the middle income people off the roads [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  so they can get in faster. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=221.4s)]
*  It's flat out, I think, wildly unfair. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=223.24s)]
*  Chris, did Secretary Duffy express any support for congestion pricing? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=228.72s)]
*  He did say he was open to the concept of congestion pricing. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=233.4s)]
*  What he didn't like in New York was, one, there is no freeway, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=236.56s)]
*  freeway, meaning no way to move through that congestion area without paying a toll. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=241.28s)]
*  And so he felt that was unfair to taxpayers who already paid taxes to build those roads. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=247.12s)]
*  He also questioned the methodology for deciding on the $9 toll. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=252.28s)]
*  He said he didn't feel like the governor of New York had done enough research [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=257.56s)]
*  that that was the dollar figure that would cut congestion. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=261.47999999999996s)]
*  He said maybe it could be $3, maybe it could be $6. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=264.84s)]
*  In his mind, he said, it sounded like they picked a dollar figure to pay the bill [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=267.56s)]
*  for the transit projects they wanted to get done. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=272.08s)]
*  All right, really interesting interview. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=274.68s)]
*  Chris, thanks very much. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw2ZA1dj9qw&t=276.4s)]
