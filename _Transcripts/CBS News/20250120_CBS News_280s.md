# What to know as Trump prepares to take office again
**CBS News:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4)
*  Good morning everyone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=0.0s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us here on CBS News 24 seven. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=1.44s)]
*  I'm Errol Barnett. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=5.0s)]
*  At this moment, it is 6 a.m. on Monday, January 20th, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=6.44s)]
*  which means we're just hours away from the inauguration [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=10.44s)]
*  of President-elect Donald Trump. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=13.6s)]
*  We have a live look at the U.S. Capitol for you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=15.96s)]
*  This is where he will take the oath of office [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=18.44s)]
*  for a second time due to bitter cold temperatures. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Today's ceremony will actually be inside. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=24.36s)]
*  The President-elect kicked off a celebration [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  of his return to power with a fireworks show in Virginia. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=29.88s)]
*  This is Saturday, and you see him there [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=33.16s)]
*  alongside Romania Trump taking in the light show. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=35.44s)]
*  The Capital One Arena in Washington will be the site [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=39.4s)]
*  for the inaugural parade as well. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=42.2s)]
*  Also a live viewing of the ceremony. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=44.36s)]
*  Yesterday, as you see here, crowds packed [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=46.96s)]
*  that 20,000 seat arena, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=48.92s)]
*  the President-elect Trump's campaign style victory lap. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=50.64s)]
*  At noon, the curtain closes on four long years [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=54.96s)]
*  of American decline, and we begin a brand new day [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=59.84s)]
*  of American strength and prosperity, dignity and pride. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  Most Americans do feel good about what comes next. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=70.68s)]
*  CBS News polling shows about 60% of the country [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  are optimistic for the next four years [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=76.44s)]
*  with Donald Trump as president. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=78.68s)]
*  As you see there, the other 40% are pessimistic. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=80.44s)]
*  On President Biden's last full day in office, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=83.92s)]
*  he reflected on his term at a church in South Carolina. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=86.56s)]
*  It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=91.28s)]
*  I'm just as passionate about our work [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=95.0s)]
*  as it was as a 29-year-old kid when I got elected. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  I wasn't old enough to serve yet. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=102.08s)]
*  I'm in no ways tired. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=106.72s)]
*  Now, as we mentioned, today's inaugural events [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  will take place inside due to what you're seeing here, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=112.46s)]
*  some extreme cold temperatures. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=115.4s)]
*  The wind chill in Washington, D.C. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  will make it feel even colder, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=119.48s)]
*  and this rare change of plans will go down in history. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=121.84s)]
*  Last time a presidential swearing-in ceremony [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=125.08000000000001s)]
*  was moved inside the Capitol was back in 1985. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=127.36000000000001s)]
*  That's when Ronald Reagan began his second term. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=131.32s)]
*  Now, despite the changes, spectators will still be able [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  to watch the presidential motorcade travel down [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=137.44s)]
*  Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House to the U.S. Capitol. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=140.24s)]
*  That's a highlight of today. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=143.94s)]
*  Trump will then return to the White House [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=145.82s)]
*  before tonight's celebrations. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=147.66s)]
*  And we have a lot to get to for you this hour, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=149.54s)]
*  including a look at inaugurations past [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=151.28s)]
*  and a conversation with Martin Luther King III. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=153.62s)]
*  But we begin with CBS News political reporter, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=156.98s)]
*  Olivia Rinaldi. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=159.26s)]
*  You've been covering Trump all along the campaign trail, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=160.66s)]
*  and now as he prepares to return to the White House, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=163.22s)]
*  give us a sense, based on his large rally yesterday, Olivia, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=166.7s)]
*  about his plans for mass deportations. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=170.14s)]
*  It's almost an item at the top of his agenda. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=173.26s)]
*  Yeah, good morning, Errol. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=175.85999999999999s)]
*  It's good to be with you. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  Day one of Trump's second presidency, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=177.7s)]
*  and he promises to make good on some of those [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=179.92s)]
*  campaign initiatives that he talked about [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=182.1s)]
*  all throughout the campaign trail that I covered. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=183.82s)]
*  He says today he is going to implement what he calls, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=186.06s)]
*  quote, the most aggressive and sweeping effort [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=188.85999999999999s)]
*  to restore the U.S. border. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=191.48s)]
*  That could include everything from directing the military [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=193.72s)]
*  to go down to the border by using an emergency, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=197.57999999999998s)]
*  declaring an emergency at the border, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=199.76s)]
*  to reinstating the return, remain in Mexico, rather, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=201.64s)]
*  policy that was part of his first administration. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=204.72s)]
*  So a lot of plans on immigration today. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=207.44s)]
*  He says that's going to be a key part [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=210.11999999999998s)]
*  of his inaugural address. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=212.2s)]
*  An inaugural address can lay out the goalposts [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=215.88s)]
*  for a presidency. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  What should we expect to hear from Trump [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=220.83999999999997s)]
*  this time around when he speaks today? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=223.11999999999998s)]
*  Well, not only about immigration, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  but talking about unity, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  restoring a sense of American unity. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=228.14s)]
*  He gave a little preview of that yesterday [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=229.92s)]
*  at that rally at Capital One, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=232.32s)]
*  where he talked about looking forward [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  and what he feels is going to be [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=236.72s)]
*  the next great American revival. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=238.77999999999997s)]
*  He's also going to talk about some of his initiatives, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=241.0s)]
*  which include getting DEI out of the military, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  getting the, quote, wokeness out of the military, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  also perhaps using the military [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=249.23999999999998s)]
*  to begin the construction of an iron dome defensive shield, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  also giving education back to the states, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=257.08000000000004s)]
*  halting the invasion at the border. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=259.96000000000004s)]
*  These are things that allies and advisors [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=261.48s)]
*  have laid out to CBS News as things [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=263.68s)]
*  he's expected to talk about as their key initiatives [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=266.36s)]
*  for his second administration era. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=269.36s)]
*  So a lot more watching there [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=271.32000000000005s)]
*  in that inaugural address today. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  All right, Olivia Rinaldi, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=275.0s)]
*  joining us from our DC Bureau. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_0RmxKvF4&t=276.40000000000003s)]
