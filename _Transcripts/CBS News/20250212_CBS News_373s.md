# Mitch McConnell voted against Tulsi Gabbard's confirmation
**CBS News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE)
*  So from the White House to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=0.0s)]
*  a budget blueprint to move the president's agenda, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=3.2s)]
*  and also that much-talked-about confirmation vote [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=5.8s)]
*  of Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=8.38s)]
*  So sharp words to really highlight here [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=10.78s)]
*  from former Senate Majority Leader and Republican [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=13.48s)]
*  Mitch McConnell. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=15.52s)]
*  He voted against confirming Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=16.82s)]
*  He cites what he calls Gabbard's alarming lapses [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=19.06s)]
*  in judgment. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=22.32s)]
*  So a lot to break down there. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=23.16s)]
*  Let's go to Nicole Killian live right now [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=24.6s)]
*  on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=26.72s)]
*  Nicole, that is a break from McConnell, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  who typically is right there in the Republican ranks. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  What did he have to say as he drilled down [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=32.42s)]
*  on his sort of hesitation for Tulsi Gabbard? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, well, just to be clear, I mean, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=39.56s)]
*  the former minority leader has certainly put some distance [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=41.06s)]
*  between himself and the president and his agenda [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=44.2s)]
*  in the past. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=47.08s)]
*  So it's not necessarily a surprise, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=47.9s)]
*  and he hasn't supported all of the president's nominees [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  in this confirmation process, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=52.94s)]
*  although he has supported the lion's share of them. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  So that being said, obviously he was a no vote [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=57.24s)]
*  on Tulsi Gabbard's nomination, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=61.24s)]
*  but certainly she's still cleared with a relative ease. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=63.32s)]
*  And that is notable, especially because on close votes [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=68.22s)]
*  like these, you know, there's JD Vance, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=71.82s)]
*  the vice president who is currently traveling overseas [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=74.62s)]
*  and really not in a position to break any type [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=77.22s)]
*  of tie breaking vote if that were to be the case. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=80.46000000000001s)]
*  So that is why this numbers game is so critical, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=82.9s)]
*  but there were enough Republican senators [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=86.06s)]
*  who had come out ahead of this vote [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=88.06s)]
*  in support of a Tulsi Gabbard's nomination, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=89.84s)]
*  even though initially they had expressed some reservations, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=92.4s)]
*  whether that senators like Susan's Maine, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=95.34s)]
*  Maine Susan Collins, or Alaska's Lisa Murkowski, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=98.28s)]
*  Indiana's Todd Young, all of them eventually broke [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=102.04s)]
*  for Gabbard. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=104.98s)]
*  So even though McConnell was the defector, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=106.22s)]
*  it really wasn't enough to prevent Gabbard [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=108.06s)]
*  from getting that confirmation vote. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=110.68s)]
*  Well, we know lawmakers are talking about it, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=114.06s)]
*  so we wanna talk about it as well. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=116.38000000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk, Doge, Musk posting a lot in recent hours [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=117.7s)]
*  about alleged fraud, alleged waste, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=121.04s)]
*  but not a lot of detail to really drill down on. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=123.28s)]
*  If I'm a member of the American public, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=126.48s)]
*  I can't really see specific citations there. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=128.26s)]
*  What's the House Oversight Committee doing [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=131.02s)]
*  by way of looking at that? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=132.62s)]
*  Well, keep in mind the House Oversight Committee [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=135.82s)]
*  has a subcommittee, a Doge Subcommittee [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=138.1s)]
*  that is led by none other than Marjorie Taylor Greene, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=140.94s)]
*  a close Trump ally who has been in close contact [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=145.12s)]
*  not only with the president, but also Elon Musk. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=148.26s)]
*  And so in terms of this hearing, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=150.56s)]
*  while Musk was not before members of Congress, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=152.66s)]
*  there were other experts from various entities there [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=155.7s)]
*  to talk about ways that waste, fraud, and abuse [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=161.2s)]
*  could be eliminated from the federal government. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=164.89999999999998s)]
*  But as we have seen with many congressional hearings, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=167.44s)]
*  much of this was along party lines [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=170.72s)]
*  with certainly Republicans backing [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=173.12s)]
*  some of these latest efforts that we have seen [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=175.28s)]
*  on the part of the Trump administration and Elon Musk, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=177.38s)]
*  while Democrats took aim, take a listen to one exchange. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  That Elon Musk is sending his unqualified Doge staff [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=185.44s)]
*  to carry out this agenda across all these agencies. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  And in some cases, actually teenage staffers. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=193.4s)]
*  No accountability, no experience, and problematic records. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  They're trying to rob you, and they're probably a minor. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=201.92s)]
*  So Ken, that was Congressman Robert Garcia [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=208.6s)]
*  channeling a little bit of Kendrick Lamar [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=211.26s)]
*  as he tried to make his point before the committee. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=213.48s)]
*  And while it certainly was heated at times, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=216.76s)]
*  for the most part, there was general bipartisan agreement [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=218.96s)]
*  on the need to cut waste, fraud, and abuse. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  Democrats were simply making the point [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=225.04s)]
*  of how they feel Republicans are going about it, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=226.8s)]
*  that they are kind of turning a blind eye [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=230.0s)]
*  to what the administration is doing, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=232.22s)]
*  and that there are other ways to proceed. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=233.06s)]
*  So again, this was the first of many hearings [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=235.70000000000002s)]
*  that we expect from this Doge subcommittee, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=238.94000000000003s)]
*  but one now in the books officially. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=241.86s)]
*  You're good. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=244.86s)]
*  I thought I was the only one who caught that A minor. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=245.70000000000002s)]
*  Kendrick Lamar reference, Nicole. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  All right, so let's talk about dollars and cents. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=249.88000000000002s)]
*  A few hours ago, House leadership released [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=251.86s)]
*  their budget resolution. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=253.58s)]
*  While the Senate Budget Committee, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=255.26000000000002s)]
*  we understand, is marking up their version today. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=256.54s)]
*  How are these plans, as you've been able to see them [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=258.66s)]
*  and know about them different from each other? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=260.66s)]
*  Yeah, well, just to be clear, obviously, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=264.66s)]
*  even though we're making reference to the budget, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=266.74s)]
*  we're not talking about the actual budget, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=268.72s)]
*  but rather a budget resolution, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=270.82000000000005s)]
*  which is simply being used as a vehicle [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=272.82000000000005s)]
*  or a procedural tool to enable the president [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=275.58000000000004s)]
*  to advance his legislative agenda. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=279.08000000000004s)]
*  So the Senate is marking up their version today [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=281.34000000000003s)]
*  with Senator Lindsey Graham at the helm. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=285.26000000000005s)]
*  As you mentioned, House Republicans have released [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=287.1s)]
*  their version, and the main difference is, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=289.46s)]
*  as you know, there's been a lot of discussion here [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=292.42s)]
*  on Capitol Hill as to whether or not there should be [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=294.62s)]
*  one bill or two bills. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=297.26s)]
*  So over in the Senate, Lindsey Graham's budget resolution [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=299.46s)]
*  is really more targeted. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=303.06s)]
*  It's really aimed at like beefing up the resources [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=304.46s)]
*  on the border since the president has been very clear [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=308.06s)]
*  about enacting his mass deportation plan. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=310.88s)]
*  So that's where that funding is particularly aimed [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=313.42s)]
*  at going to, you know, on the other side. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=316.26s)]
*  You have the House of Republicans [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=319.65999999999997s)]
*  who are kind of taking more of that big, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=321.09999999999997s)]
*  beautiful bill strategy by not only encompassing [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=323.21999999999997s)]
*  a border security, but also trying to extend [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=326.53999999999996s)]
*  the president's tax cuts to the tune of some $4.5 trillion. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=330.29999999999995s)]
*  They also want to make spending cuts [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=334.58s)]
*  in excess of almost $2 trillion, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=337.34s)]
*  and they also want to increase the debt limit, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=340.62s)]
*  which is something the president has asked for [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=343.14s)]
*  and tried to do just late last year unsuccessfully, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=344.84s)]
*  but they want to raise the debt limit [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=348.58s)]
*  by some $4 trillion. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=349.7s)]
*  So putting that all in one big package [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=351.22s)]
*  is the House's approach at this time, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=353.74s)]
*  and both House and Senate leaders insist eventually [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=356.18s)]
*  they will both be on the same page. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=360.02s)]
*  Ambitious, and you have to be ambitious to chase it all [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=362.9s)]
*  and be able to digest it all with all things politics [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=365.3s)]
*  and some pop culture mixed in. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=368.02s)]
*  Nicole Killian, always great to talk to you. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=370.1s)]
*  Have a great day. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letmUBHjMaE&t=371.9s)]
