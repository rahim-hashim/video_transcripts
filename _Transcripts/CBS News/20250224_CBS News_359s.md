# Some federal agencies tell workers to ignore Musk email
**CBS News:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A)
*  An email from the Office of Personnel Management and apparently prompted by Elon Musk's Department [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=0.0s)]
*  of Government Efficiency or DOJ is asking federal employees to justify what they do. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=4.92s)]
*  It asks staffers to reply with five bullets of what they accomplished last week. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=10.0s)]
*  The deadline is 1159 p.m. Eastern Monday. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=14.52s)]
*  Musk claims a failure to respond will be taken as a resignation. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=18.48s)]
*  President Trump was asked what he thought about the email earlier Monday. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  I thought it was great. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  By asking the question, tell us what you did this week, what he's doing is saying, are [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=28.52s)]
*  you actually working? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=32.92s)]
*  And then if you don't answer, like you're sort of semi-fired or you're fired. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=34.82s)]
*  But the emails generated a fair amount of confusion. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=40.72s)]
*  Some agencies like the Pentagon and State Department have told employees to disregard [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  the message. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=46.36s)]
*  And two officials say the Office of Personnel Management or OPM is now saying it's up to [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  each entity to determine how they want to handle the directive. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=51.4s)]
*  CBS News chief, Washington correspondent Major Garrett joins us now. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=55.12s)]
*  So Major, President Trump says he approves of what Musk is doing. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=58.04s)]
*  Some agencies, though, were telling their employees to ignore the email. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=61.379999999999995s)]
*  What does this say about the authority of Elon Musk? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=64.16s)]
*  And does it suggest to you a potential power struggle brewing between Musk and some of [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=66.36s)]
*  the president's top picks? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=70.96s)]
*  I wouldn't say necessarily, Lindsay. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=72.36s)]
*  It's a power struggle. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=74.72s)]
*  What the administration knows is if these changes to the composition of the federal [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=76.56s)]
*  workforce are going to be put through and legally binding, they must be put through [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=81.36s)]
*  by the Senate-confirmed head of that agency. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=86.0s)]
*  Elon Musk, if he does it all by himself and the paper trail shows it's only through his [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=90.08s)]
*  authority as a special assistant to the president, it's on much shakier legal ground. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=94.96s)]
*  So this is sort of deferring to the proper order of things if, in fact, the head of the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=100.0s)]
*  State Department, the head of the Interior Department, and the cabinet agencies wants [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=104.0s)]
*  to restructure their workforce. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=107.16s)]
*  They have much more legal authority to do that as a Senate-confirmed cabinet secretary [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=109.22s)]
*  than Elon Musk does. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=113.66s)]
*  But still, there is this sense within the White House that Elon Musk is exercising a [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=115.26s)]
*  lot of authority, saying things on social media that cannot be backed up, that are either [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=121.1s)]
*  not legally valid or politically problematic. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=125.22s)]
*  But President Trump, so far, doesn't want any space between him and Elon Musk, probably [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=128.46s)]
*  because he wants Elon Musk to get as far as he can, take whatever political backlash comes [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=133.54s)]
*  to him, not necessarily to President Trump, and shrink the size of the federal workforce [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=138.5s)]
*  to the best he can. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=142.78s)]
*  Everyone within the White House realizes this is a four-, five-, six-month process at the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=144.58s)]
*  most because by then the political backlash is likely to be such that there'll be members [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=149.46s)]
*  of Congress, Republican House members, Republican Senate members, who may say, we need to tap [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=153.96s)]
*  the brakes on this, so they want to go as fast as they can and get as much done as they [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=159.46s)]
*  can possibly achieve. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=163.10000000000002s)]
*  But Musk has stated before President Trump took office he wanted people, he wanted to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=166.38s)]
*  shift people from what he called low to negative productivity jobs in government to high productivity [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=169.9s)]
*  jobs in the private sector. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=175.34s)]
*  Now this, what is that doing to the morale within the federal government? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=177.1s)]
*  Well, morale within the federal government is very much up for grabs right now. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=180.66s)]
*  There are those who have already been laid off who are looking for new futures, new jobs, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=185.85999999999999s)]
*  and explaining to their spouses that the once secure federal job they had no longer exists. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=190.9s)]
*  If they have spouses or families or any other budgets, they're having to respond on the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=196.32s)]
*  fly, not unlike people in the private sector who suddenly receive a layoff notice. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=200.56s)]
*  And I trust you, there are a lot of people in the Trump world politically who say, hey, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=205.2s)]
*  the federal government just living through what people in the private sector have been [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=209.76s)]
*  living through, through recessions and other layoffs. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=212.51999999999998s)]
*  It's just reality of life. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=214.84s)]
*  But that said, lots of people don't know if their jobs that they currently possess are [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=217.0s)]
*  going to exist in the future. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=221.7s)]
*  The Republicans in Congress could be more assertive about things that have already been [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  appropriated that are on the books, money that's available, that should be spent, and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=228.44000000000003s)]
*  revisit all this in the next budget year. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=233.56s)]
*  But so far, Republicans are giving the president a lot of latitude. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=235.36s)]
*  So morale at best is jumbled, and in some agencies, very much on the downward trajectory. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=238.60000000000002s)]
*  A major by Sunday at midnight, about 4,200 staff for the U.S. Agency for International [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=245.36s)]
*  Development or USAID were placed on leave. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=250.2s)]
*  Another 2,000 will be fired. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=252.76s)]
*  This after a federal judge Friday allowed the administration to move forward with plans [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=254.88s)]
*  to put USAID, it wants to put USAID under the purview of the State Department. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  Some of this was to be expected. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=263.68s)]
*  We've been reporting on this for weeks. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=264.68s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=267.0s)]
*  Executive authority is real, and the president does have these authorities. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  And he can move things through one process or another to a different agency, if that's [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=273.96s)]
*  what he believes is the proper exercise of executive power. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=279.68s)]
*  And the courts so far are willing to let the president exercise that particular latitude. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=283.2s)]
*  And in the general impression that those in the Trump movement believe that foreign aid [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=290.6s)]
*  is much larger than it actually is and is probably more wasteful than it is efficient, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=296.12s)]
*  this is not going to create a political blowback. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=301.48s)]
*  But for those American farmers who provide the grains that is now rotting on docks that [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=303.64s)]
*  won't be sent because USAID can't move it anywhere, or those who are in the field providing [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=308.24s)]
*  medicines or other assistance for those in need, under the rubric of USAID authority, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=313.08s)]
*  their jobs no longer exist, that aid no longer exists, that American-stamped assistance, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=319.28s)]
*  health care, food, other things, is being peeled back. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=325.03999999999996s)]
*  There are those in the foreign policy community that believe that for more than 60 years this [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=330.64s)]
*  was something the United States believed was not just a matter of moral imperative, but [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=334.78s)]
*  had national security implications as well. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=339.41999999999996s)]
*  The exercise, if you will, of soft power to orient America's relationship in the third [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=342.14s)]
*  world differently than it was as just a simple superpower. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=347.38s)]
*  That's now receding, and President Trump wants it to recede as rapidly as possible. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=350.53999999999996s)]
*  And, Matric, you're always providing us with the necessary context. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=354.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuQ1lxlHa6A&t=357.78s)]
