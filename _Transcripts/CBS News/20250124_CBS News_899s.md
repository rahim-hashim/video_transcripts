# Trump takes questions after arriving in North Carolina to see Hurricane Helene damage
**CBS News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ)
*  Olivia, I hate to interrupt you here, but the president is speaking to the reporters [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=0.0s)]
*  there in the tarmac in Asheville. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=3.4s)]
*  Let's go to him now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=4.9s)]
*  And you know who they are and we're going to fix it. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=5.9s)]
*  And we're going to fix it as fast as you can. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  It's a massive amount of damage. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=10.96s)]
*  FEMA has really let us down, let the country down. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=13.16s)]
*  And I don't know if that's Biden's fault or whose fault it is, but we're going to take [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=17.3s)]
*  over and we're going to do a good job. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=21.48s)]
*  We're going to assign Mr. Watley, who's fantastic, frankly, and the governor and everybody else [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=23.88s)]
*  that's going to work. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=32.0s)]
*  We're going to supply the money, supply a lot of the money. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=33.0s)]
*  Maybe you have to chip in something. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=36.6s)]
*  You're chipping a little something like maybe 25 percent or whatever. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=37.6s)]
*  But we're going to get it done as quickly as we can. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=42.56s)]
*  And we want to take care of the people of North Carolina. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  It's so interesting. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=49.0s)]
*  And that's a mess. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=51.52s)]
*  But I said, I'm not going to California until I stop in North Carolina. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=54.0s)]
*  So here we are. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=57.46s)]
*  We're going to go visit the site and we're going to work with probably three of the congressmen, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=58.72s)]
*  Republican congressmen who've been fantastic, whose areas have been affected. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=64.12s)]
*  And with Michael Watley, the governor and whoever else is, you know, we decide to get [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  out, probably less FEMA because FEMA just hasn't done the job. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=76.2s)]
*  And we're looking at the whole concept of FEMA. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  I like, frankly, the concept when North Carolina gets hit, the governor takes care of it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=83.12s)]
*  When Florida gets hit, the governor takes care of it, meaning the state takes care of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=88.76s)]
*  it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=93.16s)]
*  To have a group of people come in from an area that don't even know where they're going [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=94.16s)]
*  in order to solve immediately a problem is something that never worked for me. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=98.84s)]
*  This is probably one of the best examples of it not working. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=103.42s)]
*  And there's been some others like in Louisiana, et cetera. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=107.26s)]
*  So we're going to be doing something on FEMA that I think most people agree. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=110.94s)]
*  I'd like to see the states take care of disasters. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=115.98s)]
*  Let the state take care of the tornadoes and the hurricanes and all of the other things [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=118.68s)]
*  that happen. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=123.10000000000001s)]
*  And I think you're going to find it a lot less expensive. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=124.58000000000001s)]
*  You'll do it for less than half and you're going to get a lot quicker response. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=126.82000000000001s)]
*  So that seems to be the recommendation, but we'll be making that recommendation over [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=131.67999999999998s)]
*  the next couple of weeks. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=135.64s)]
*  We're going to go to the site now and we're going to figure out a plan for really demolition [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=138.0s)]
*  and cleaning because not a lot's been done. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=144.2s)]
*  And we're very disappointed in the Biden administration, but we're going to make up for lost time. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  And I said I'd do that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=154.2s)]
*  And this is about the earliest we could possibly be here. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=155.92s)]
*  And we're honored to be here. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  This has been a great state. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=161.16000000000003s)]
*  They're great people and they've really been mishandled. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=162.36s)]
*  But it's all this group is going to be great and we're going to get it taken care of. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=166.28s)]
*  Any questions? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=170.36s)]
*  How was it responding to FEMA? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=171.36s)]
*  Do you expect to ask Congress for additional aid for North Carolina and California? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=172.36s)]
*  Yes, it will be directed. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=176.44s)]
*  In other words, the aid will go through us. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=177.44s)]
*  So rather than going through FEMA, it will go through us. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  And I think maybe this is a good place to start because, and in all fairness to the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=182.52s)]
*  governor and all fairness to everybody else, FEMA was not on the ball. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=187.28s)]
*  And we're going to turn it all around. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=192.32000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=194.84s)]
*  A lot of Americans think that this is symbolic of what your campaign was all about. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=195.84s)]
*  America first, putting your priorities to Americans. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=200.16s)]
*  Even going to California where their policies might have been more the biggest reasons why [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=203.44s)]
*  they've had these problems. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  But you're putting American people first. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  Your thoughts on that? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  We are. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  I like that question. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  Boy, I want more questions like that. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  That's even a statement. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=216.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=217.56s)]
*  He's a good man, that guy. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=218.56s)]
*  And he's also a very professional reporter, I have to say. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=219.56s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=222.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=223.52s)]
*  We're putting America first. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=224.52s)]
*  We're putting, in this case, North Carolina and California. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=225.52s)]
*  We're going to do a good job in California. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=228.36s)]
*  That is a disaster like, I don't know if we've ever seen anything like it, frankly. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=230.08s)]
*  They say the biggest in the history of California, I think, has anything bigger than that happened [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=235.6s)]
*  in the whole country ever. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=241.12s)]
*  It looks like, I don't want to say what it looks like, but you know what I'm going to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=243.24s)]
*  say, it looks like something hit it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=246.32s)]
*  And we won't talk about what hit it, but it is a bad, bad situation. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  And I guess I'm going to meet with some government officials, but I mean, much more importantly. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=253.64s)]
*  And in California, just to revert to it for a second, millions of gallons of water are [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=260.28s)]
*  waiting to be poured down through already the half pipes that are already built. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=266.38s)]
*  I mean, they've been up for 40 years. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=272.08s)]
*  And about 20 years ago, they turned off the water. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=274.68s)]
*  And it's the water that comes from the Pacific Northwest. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=277.48s)]
*  Some of it comes out of Canada, and it flows there, and it probably has flowed there for [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=281.06s)]
*  a million years. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=285.8s)]
*  And they turned it off and they routed out to the Pacific. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=287.56s)]
*  And in the meantime, you don't have water in the hydrants. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=291.16s)]
*  You don't have water in the sprinkler systems. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=293.68s)]
*  It's the craziest thing I've ever seen. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  And everyone's trying to figure out why aren't they turning it back. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  They say it's the Delta Smelt. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=301.64s)]
*  It's a fish. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=303.16s)]
*  I find that hard to believe, but we'll figure it out. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=304.6s)]
*  And without doing that, you're going to continue to have problems. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=307.8s)]
*  Mr. President, what are you prepared to do, sir, if OPEC doesn't respond to your call [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=312.08s)]
*  to cut oil prices? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=316.6s)]
*  Well, we want to see OPEC cut the price of oil, and that will automatically stop the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=318.4s)]
*  tragedy that's taking place in Ukraine. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=323.8s)]
*  It's a butchering tragedy for both sides, by the way. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  Tremendous number of Russian soldiers are dead. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=331.16s)]
*  Tremendous number of Ukrainian soldiers. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=334.64s)]
*  And a lot of people are dead from the bombing of the cities. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=337.2s)]
*  But right now, it's just bullets whacking and hitting men, mostly men, almost in all [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=340.12s)]
*  cases men. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=346.8s)]
*  And they're over a million men are killed. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=349.16s)]
*  And they're losing thousands of people a week. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=352.12s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=355.68s)]
*  It's a crazy war. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=357.12s)]
*  And it never would have happened if I was president. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=359.0s)]
*  Would never have happened. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=361.32s)]
*  This is crazy that it happened. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=362.35999999999996s)]
*  But we want to stop it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=364.28s)]
*  Now, one way to stop it quickly is for OPEC to stop making so much money and to drop the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=365.56s)]
*  price of oil, because they have it nice and high. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=372.03999999999996s)]
*  And if you have it high, that war is not going to end so easily. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=376.0s)]
*  So OPEC ought to get on the ball and they ought to drop the price of oil. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=379.2s)]
*  And that war will stop right away. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=383.96s)]
*  Mr. President, is funding to Los Angeles because of its sanctuary city policy? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=385.96000000000004s)]
*  I want to see two things in Los Angeles. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=389.8s)]
*  Voter ID so that the people have a chance to vote. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=392.52000000000004s)]
*  And I want to see the water be released and come down into Los Angeles and throughout [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=396.12s)]
*  the state. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=400.24s)]
*  Those are the two things. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=401.24s)]
*  After that, I will be the greatest president that California has ever seen. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=402.24s)]
*  I want the water to come down and come down to Los Angeles and also go out to all the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=407.88s)]
*  farmland that's barren and dry. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=413.40000000000003s)]
*  You know, they have land that they say is the equivalent of the land in Iowa, which [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=416.04s)]
*  is about as good as there is anywhere on earth. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  The problem is it's artificial because they artificially stop the water from going onto [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=423.24s)]
*  the land. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=429.16s)]
*  So I want two things. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=430.36s)]
*  I want voter ID for the people of California. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=431.48s)]
*  They all want it. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=434.16s)]
*  Right now, you have no you don't have voter ID. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=435.40000000000003s)]
*  People want to have voter identification. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=439.12s)]
*  You want to have proof of citizenship. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=441.88s)]
*  Ideally, you have one day voting, but I just want voter ID as a start and I want the water [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=443.84s)]
*  to be released and they're going to get a lot of help from the U.S. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=449.76s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=453.92s)]
*  I'll see you in a little while. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=454.92s)]
*  We'll see you at the site. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=455.92s)]
*  We'll see you at the site. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=456.92s)]
*  Where are they going from? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=457.92s)]
*  Where are they going to? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=458.92s)]
*  Very well. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=459.92s)]
*  We're getting the bad, hard criminals out. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=460.92s)]
*  These are murderers. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=467.24s)]
*  These are people that have been as bad as you get, as bad as anybody you've seen. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=469.12s)]
*  We're taking them out first. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=473.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=474.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=475.8s)]
*  Thank you, guys. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=476.8s)]
*  Move to the grass. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=477.8s)]
*  Move to the grass. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=478.8s)]
*  This is President Trump there on the tarmac in Asheville, North Carolina. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=479.8s)]
*  He landed just moments ago there to tour the devastation left behind by Hurricane Helene. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=483.04s)]
*  Later on today, he's going to get a briefing from state and county officials and emergency [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=489.6s)]
*  officials on the relief efforts there. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=494.26s)]
*  And then later on today, he's going to head to Southern California. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=496.0s)]
*  It's worth noting, though, in his remarks when he first spoke to reporters, it was all [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=498.92s)]
*  about criticizing FEMA and what the role that they were playing and the relief efforts for [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=503.28s)]
*  the people who were devastated by those hurricanes. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=508.48s)]
*  So I want to bring in CBS News national correspondent Dave Malkoff, who's been following the president [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=511.56s)]
*  on the ground there in North Carolina. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=516.54s)]
*  It's worth noting, Dave, that you also were on the ground there when the hurricanes came. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=518.96s)]
*  And then also you've covered extensively the relief efforts to help these communities [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=524.24s)]
*  come back. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=529.44s)]
*  I mean, there's so much devastation still left behind. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=530.44s)]
*  I'm curious, what did you make about the president's comments about the states taking care of their [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=533.36s)]
*  own natural disasters and then criticizing FEMA? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=537.88s)]
*  Well, Liz, there is this notion that he's putting forward, and we've heard this before [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=541.64s)]
*  today in a little bit more detail of taking the facility of FEMA and moving it into the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=548.3s)]
*  states and the things that FEMA does and moving it into what the state would do. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=556.06s)]
*  But this is at least a $59 billion disaster, just Hurricane Helene and the devastation [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=560.74s)]
*  that it wrought here in Appalachia and all throughout its path. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=568.2199999999999s)]
*  it had enough power to push all the way into the state, 500 miles from landfall and do [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=572.8s)]
*  all of this. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=579.3599999999999s)]
*  So if you're talking about $59 billion or $60 billion here and then another $59 or $60 [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=580.52s)]
*  billion in California, you're talking about lots and lots of money. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=589.04s)]
*  And we have so many billion-dollar disasters, and you would have to have the states find [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=593.24s)]
*  out a way to funnel that money from the federal government possibly and then into their own [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=599.1s)]
*  recovery effort. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=606.1s)]
*  And we're talking about things that cannot be recovered. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=607.58s)]
*  There are more than 2000 landslides that have happened in this region alone. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=611.3000000000001s)]
*  So there are some areas, an area larger than the size of Rhode Island that cannot be built [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=618.0400000000001s)]
*  on again because of all those landslides. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=625.0s)]
*  So we're talking about a huge, huge recovery effort, just one bridge that goes out. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=628.82s)]
*  You're talking about $5 million to put that bridge back. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=634.4200000000001s)]
*  And we have more than 800 bridges just in North Carolina alone that are damaged or destroyed. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=637.26s)]
*  So there are so many projects that would take so much effort that it would be a big deal [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=644.08s)]
*  to move it from the federal emergency management folks in D.C. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=651.6s)]
*  and then move it down to each state, each individual state. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=658.36s)]
*  And I'm not sure what kind of logistics they have in those states, but definitely this is the second time [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=661.84s)]
*  that we've heard this from President Trump and we'll probably hear more about this from [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=667.0400000000001s)]
*  J.D. Vance on Meet the Press this Sunday. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=671.84s)]
*  And Dave, yesterday you did a very compelling story where you toured some of the damage [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=673.84s)]
*  that was happening and it looks like from their video that you had yesterday that [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=678.1600000000001s)]
*  this hurricane could have happened yesterday. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=682.96s)]
*  I mean, that's what the that's just the damage that's been left behind and just the massive [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=685.2s)]
*  effort to clean up. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=688.8000000000001s)]
*  We know the president will be meeting with a family that lost their home to the hurricane. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=690.32s)]
*  And you've spoken to survivors in the state about what they think the president will do for them. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=695.12s)]
*  What did you learn from those conversations? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=699.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of people were just surprised by this hurricane coming up all the way into their area. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=702.5600000000001s)]
*  They haven't seen anything like this in at least 108 years. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=710.8000000000001s)]
*  That's the last time something this big has happened. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=714.8000000000001s)]
*  We talked to a couple who his home was destroyed. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=718.32s)]
*  This is Chris and Tracy and his home was destroyed. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=722.0s)]
*  And then now he's living in a trailer with his girlfriend. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=726.08s)]
*  And we asked them, what do you think about President Trump coming to this area? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=729.8399999999999s)]
*  And this is what they told us. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=733.76s)]
*  We can't wait for Trump to come. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=736.4799999999999s)]
*  For Trump. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=738.16s)]
*  I'm glad he's back in office. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=738.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we voted for Trump. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=739.1999999999999s)]
*  We voted for Trump. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=740.4s)]
*  Big time. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=741.76s)]
*  We really believe he's going to help here. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=743.28s)]
*  He's going to help everything. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=746.56s)]
*  Here. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=747.3599999999999s)]
*  He's going to make changes, good changes with everything. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=747.92s)]
*  What kind of changes would you like to see? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=752.64s)]
*  Like I said, people out of tents, at least. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=754.88s)]
*  At least if nothing else. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=757.28s)]
*  In shelters. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=758.64s)]
*  At least that. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=759.92s)]
*  Like that. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=760.9599999999999s)]
*  And try to get more big equipment here to move some of our, clean up some of the rivers [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=762.88s)]
*  and the creeks, you know, because. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=769.4399999999999s)]
*  And all the damages. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=770.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=771.92s)]
*  We have heard a lot of people talking about the problems that they have had with FEMA [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=772.9599999999999s)]
*  and trying to get relief from that organization. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=778.4s)]
*  But also they've run into red tape from their local organizations on the county level. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=781.28s)]
*  And people in some cases are taking matters into their own hands. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=787.9200000000001s)]
*  And instead of going through and getting money from FEMA and waiting and waiting and waiting, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=792.4s)]
*  they're going ahead and putting things together with just what they call mountain ingenuity, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=799.2s)]
*  where they take maybe a rail car and put it over the river area. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=804.88s)]
*  And this is the river right here. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=809.6s)]
*  And they, that's a way that they can get from one side to the other. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=811.2s)]
*  And that's just a temporary solution. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=815.76s)]
*  But getting this infrastructure put in, it takes, you have to put in a site survey. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=818.08s)]
*  You have to get the grant money for that. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=824.88s)]
*  You have to go through the entire construction process that could take a year or more. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=827.84s)]
*  So these things take a long time to recover. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=833.36s)]
*  But we have heard that a lot of people frustrated by getting money from FEMA. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=835.68s)]
*  There is this program where you can get money for your house if it is deemed that it's unlivable [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=840.8s)]
*  in that area and they can buy you out in a certain way. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=849.52s)]
*  And that comes from the federal government as well. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=854.0799999999999s)]
*  And they have had a lot of success with that. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=856.3199999999999s)]
*  But we've heard on both sides, we've heard people who did get money from FEMA and were [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=859.1999999999999s)]
*  happy about it and people who did not. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=863.52s)]
*  And they are still waiting and waiting and waiting. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=866.2399999999999s)]
*  But there are a lot of people here who are suffering and they have a lot of hurt. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePhM0pPtEQ&t=868.88s)]
