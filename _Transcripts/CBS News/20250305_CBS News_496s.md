# Major moments from Trump's address to Congress
**CBS News:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU)
*  All right, so we begin with really widespread reaction to President Trump's speech to Congress. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=0.0s)]
*  The president said, quote, America is back. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=5.2s)]
*  And he is emphasizing his agenda during a 100-minute speech promising what he calls [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=8.6s)]
*  a golden age for America. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=14.22s)]
*  My focus is on building the most powerful military of the future. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=16.36s)]
*  We've had serious discussions with Russia and have received strong signals that they [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  are ready for peace. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=25.16s)]
*  I was saved by God to make America great again. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=26.68s)]
*  And I believe that the golden age of America has only just begun. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=29.64s)]
*  Now, CBS News polling shows a large majority of viewers, most of whom are Republicans, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=35.24s)]
*  you should be aware, approved of Donald Trump's speech. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=42.68s)]
*  Supporters called it presidential and entertaining. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  And as you see next to me, only 23 percent of people who watch the speech disapproved [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  of what they heard. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=53.6s)]
*  Now, we have full team coverage of all of this for you. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=54.6s)]
*  We begin with CBS News White House reporter Olivia Rinaldi in our Washington bureau. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=57.08s)]
*  And you can also see CBS News congressional correspondent Nicole Killian standing by. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=61.4s)]
*  Olivia, let's begin with you. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=65.48s)]
*  What was your biggest takeaway from Trump's 100-minute address last night? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=67.64s)]
*  Well, besides it being the longest address that's happened in front of Congress in a [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=72.64s)]
*  long time, Errol, there were a couple of things that Trump said that certainly caught my attention. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=78.0s)]
*  Let's tick through them. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=83.56s)]
*  The first, he said he wants to get rid of the CHIPS Act. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=84.92s)]
*  This was something he said caught my eye, caught my attention, because this was a wildly [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=87.83999999999999s)]
*  popular bipartisan bill to increase CHIP production in the U.S. for national security purposes [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=93.0s)]
*  and also economic purposes. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=99.36s)]
*  Trump turned to Speaker Johnson and told him they should get rid of the act and use the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=101.8s)]
*  leftover money to pay off some of the debt. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=106.53999999999999s)]
*  I'm curious how that will impact, especially Republican lawmakers, who this act was very [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=108.64s)]
*  popular in a lot of their districts. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=114.14s)]
*  He also urged Congress to make his tax cuts permanent, adding that he wants to make American-made [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=116.22s)]
*  car taxes deductible, the interest on American-made cars deductible. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=121.66s)]
*  He also blamed President Biden, former President Biden, for the high cost of eggs. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=127.74s)]
*  That certainly caught my attention. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=133.2s)]
*  Of course, that's something that a lot of Americans have been talking and certainly [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=134.48s)]
*  noticing when they're at the grocery store. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=138.0s)]
*  Trump says it's not my fault, it's his. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=139.85999999999999s)]
*  He's doing what he can to bring down the cost of eggs, directing his secretaries to handle that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=142.24s)]
*  I do also want to know, he talked about his tariff policy. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=147.68s)]
*  On his tariffs, he said if you make your product in America, you won't have these tariffs, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=151.74s)]
*  which can be rather large. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  I do want to toss to a bit of sound where he talked about how Americans will be feeling [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=158.36s)]
*  the squeeze on some of his tariffs. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=163.18s)]
*  It may be a little bit of an adjustment period. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=167.26000000000002s)]
*  We had that before when I made the deal with China, $50 billion of purchases. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=170.66s)]
*  And I said, just bear with me. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=174.7s)]
*  And they did. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=176.46s)]
*  They did. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=177.62s)]
*  Probably have to bear with me again. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=178.62s)]
*  And this will be even better. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=181.1s)]
*  That was great. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=182.34s)]
*  And Trump asking Americans there to stand by him, bear with him, as we are going to go [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=185.06s)]
*  into what he's calling an adjustment period, Errol, for these tariffs. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=190.5s)]
*  That's also code for high prices. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=195.28s)]
*  Very good point, Olivia. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  Thank you for that standby. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=199.22s)]
*  Nicole, I want to ask you about the Democratic position on all of this, because there are [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=200.45999999999998s)]
*  questions as to whether they should react theatrically to what the president was saying [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=204.85999999999999s)]
*  or organize against policy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=209.42s)]
*  Do Democrats feel that their visual protests last night were effective? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=212.89999999999998s)]
*  To put it in, I talked to a Democratic member before the joint address got underway. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=217.1s)]
*  What this member conveyed is that, which is largely what leader Jeffries conveyed ahead [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=226.14s)]
*  of this address, is that it really kind of is a personal decision or was a personal decision [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=231.18s)]
*  for members. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=235.62s)]
*  In the case of the member that I spoke to yesterday, this person chose to attend the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=236.62s)]
*  joint session and said that they were there to kind of listen and hear the president out, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=242.01999999999998s)]
*  primarily because of the makeup of their district. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=247.98s)]
*  So, you know, I think you have to take that into consideration with respect to how some [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=252.18s)]
*  Democrats responded. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=257.62s)]
*  Yes, some of it was organized in the sense of, you know, many members, for instance, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  in the Congressional Progressive Caucus had those signs that they were holding up. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=263.5s)]
*  Some walked out of the speech. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=267.65999999999997s)]
*  Of course, the most notable was the disruption from Texas Congressman Al Green. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=268.94s)]
*  But, you know, he's certainly been around the block a long time here on Capitol Hill, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=273.86s)]
*  and he made clear that he is not concerned about any punishment that might come his way, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=277.5s)]
*  that he felt that he wanted to stand up in that moment because of what he believes are [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=283.74s)]
*  very punishing cuts on the part of the Trump administration and potentially more to come [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=289.5s)]
*  when you look, for instance, at potential cuts to Medicaid as Republicans try to debate [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=294.58s)]
*  a larger budget package. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=300.9s)]
*  So, from that standpoint, while, yes, some believe that a Democrat's actions were disgraceful [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=302.94s)]
*  or may not have been as cohesive as some wanted, at the end of the day, it was an individual [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=308.94s)]
*  decision for members. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=315.97999999999996s)]
*  And we were just watching footage there of the congressman being escorted out. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=317.53999999999996s)]
*  Speaker Johnson saying he's open to a censure of the congressman, if that's brought to the floor. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=322.06s)]
*  Olivia, we had this CBS News polling, which is only of people who watched the speech and [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=327.5s)]
*  similar to the room inside, a lot of Democrats chose not just to physically be there, but [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=331.98s)]
*  not to tune in. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=335.7s)]
*  But from those who watched the speech, they're hopeful about Trump's presidency and his plans [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=336.7s)]
*  to tackle inflation. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=341.62s)]
*  So what is next on the president's agenda on that front? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=343.14s)]
*  Yeah, we should note that our polling from last night reflects that a majority of the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=345.94s)]
*  viewers of the speech were Republican. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=351.46s)]
*  They do feel quite hopeful about the direction of the country and what they heard from Trump. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=353.5s)]
*  He did highlight a lot of lightning rod issues for Republicans, including the anti-trans culture [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=360.02s)]
*  war targeting of DEI, targeting of waste in the federal government and really bolstering [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=364.82s)]
*  Elon Musk in that speech. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=371.38s)]
*  So all these things, lightning rods for Republicans, they liked hearing it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=373.65999999999997s)]
*  But you're right, the conversation around inflation and high price is still something [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=377.5s)]
*  that everyday Americans are feeling. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=381.78s)]
*  But our poll showed that about two thirds of people who watched the speech, again, majority [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=384.65999999999997s)]
*  Republicans, liked what they heard from Trump as far as tackling high prices. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=389.1s)]
*  They feel that he had a good plan to handle that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=393.62s)]
*  But now the next part of all of this, as we heard from Trump yesterday, he tackled immigration, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=396.38s)]
*  a lot of executive orders on that, a lot of executive orders on culture war items. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=402.66s)]
*  But those targeting of high prices, which Americans are certainly going to start feeling [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=407.34000000000003s)]
*  now, especially with those tariffs, that's something they want to see action on. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=411.3s)]
*  Nicole, on Olivia's point, you need bipartisanship to get government funding approved. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=415.42s)]
*  These speeches typically from one president include some aspect of reaching out across [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=421.14s)]
*  the aisle to get the business of the people done. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=426.3s)]
*  What is the latest on a potential government shutdown and an agreement between Democrats [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=429.58s)]
*  and Republicans to avoid it? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=433.54s)]
*  Well, right now an agreement remains elusive, although Speaker Mike Johnson has indicated [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=435.54s)]
*  he will probably move forward with what is called a continuing resolution, which is just [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=439.86s)]
*  basically another short term funding bill to fund the government through the rest of [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=445.06s)]
*  this fiscal year. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=448.9s)]
*  That is something that some Democrats are still noodling around. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=450.3s)]
*  Others just feel that they don't believe that this is the right direction to go. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=453.98s)]
*  So that is not stopping the speaker and House Republican leaders from potentially moving [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=459.74s)]
*  forward with this, although no legislative text has really been provided as of yet. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=465.46s)]
*  You know, the hope is that maybe they can get something out as we get towards the end [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=470.54s)]
*  of the week or the beginning of next week. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=474.82s)]
*  It has to, quite frankly, if they want to try to clear this Friday deadline. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=476.46s)]
*  And even if Republicans are able to single handedly get this out of the House, ultimately [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=481.02s)]
*  it would need some Democratic support in the Senate. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=487.42s)]
*  All right, Olivia Rinaldi and Nicole Killian, my sincerest appreciation to you both. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=490.18s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVzh2TnTlU&t=495.18s)]
