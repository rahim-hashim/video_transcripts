# Examining the legality of Trump's buyout offer to federal workers
**CBS News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18)
*  boy, it's just going to be a gravy train. You're just going to get paid for seven months [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=0.0s)]
*  without working. The president has no authority to make that offer. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=4.8s)]
*  COSTA Virginia Democrat Senator Tim Kaine there, pushing back against the Trump [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  administration's offer to around 2 million federal workers to resign and be paid through [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=14.32s)]
*  September. Let's bring in Katherine Watson, a politics reporter for CBS News Digital. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=19.2s)]
*  Katherine, great to have you here. What's your latest reporting tell you about this [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=23.76s)]
*  offer and whether it's actually going to be entertained by some federal workers? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=27.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, basically federal workers got this email that they were completely not expecting, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  not only telling them to be back in the office five days a week, but saying that if they [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=37.92s)]
*  didn't want to do that, they could go ahead and simply defer their resignation. They would need [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=41.52s)]
*  to make a decision by February 6 as to whether they wanted to resign. They were told all they [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=46.56s)]
*  needed to do was simply reply to an email with the word resign and it would become effective [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=51.52s)]
*  September 30th that they would basically be able to receive pay and seemingly not work at most [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=57.04s)]
*  federal agencies. That obviously sparked a lot of confusion. There weren't really any clarifications [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=63.68s)]
*  as to the details of this offer, so that's something that federal agencies have been [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=69.6s)]
*  scrambling, scrambling to get, that federal employees have been scrambling to get. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=74.4s)]
*  But it's definitely created a lot of confusion and I've spoken to some employment, federal [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=78.24s)]
*  employment attorneys and that kind of thing to try to get some of these details sorted out. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=82.72s)]
*  So Katherine, when you spoke to those attorneys, what are some of the legal questions being raised [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=86.64s)]
*  about this proposal? Yeah, well as you heard Tim Kaine mention, it's really unclear as to whether [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=91.2s)]
*  the president, whether the White House, whether OPM, the Office of Personnel Management can make [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=96.24s)]
*  this offer in the first place. But then of course there are concerns over whether federal employees [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=102.32s)]
*  will be guaranteed to get that money, right? It really isn't spelled out what kind of protections [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=107.84s)]
*  there are. Say a federal employee goes ahead and decides to submit their deferred resignation, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=112.72s)]
*  if you will. It's really unclear as to whether they have protections to make sure they get paid. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=118.24s)]
*  It's also a little unclear as to whether they can go back on that resignation if they do decide to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=124.56s)]
*  offer it. So a lot of questions that are really unanswered here. Basically one of the attorneys, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=130.0s)]
*  one of the federal employment attorneys I spoke with today said this really puts federal employees [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=135.12s)]
*  in a precarious situation. Although this particular attorney said they understand that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=139.76s)]
*  these federal workers don't know if they're going to have a job in six months, if it could be [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=144.32s)]
*  eliminated. So this offer is, you know, potentially something to think about as well. So what's the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=148.0s)]
*  Trump administration's motivation here based on your reporting? Is it about trying to shrink the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  federal workforce by the end of the year? Is it part of a broader ideological project? Yeah, certainly. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=159.76s)]
*  Well, this is, if you will, kind of part of the return to work order that the president is [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  instituting, that the federal government is instituting. But the White House has been really [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  clear. They haven't been shy, haven't shied away from the reality that they are trying to cut costs, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=175.52s)]
*  that they are trying to shrink the size of the federal workforce. And they see this as just a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=181.36s)]
*  really effective way to do it. If I can add to that, we have sourcing at CBS News that up to maybe [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=185.84s)]
*  10 percent is kind of the estimate of federal employees might go ahead and do this deferred [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=192.56s)]
*  resignation. Of course, we're going to see what those numbers look like if this policy really does [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=196.88s)]
*  go through. And that's something agencies have been told to track, is how many employees are [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=201.36s)]
*  submitting these deferred resignations. It certainly caused a stir. Just traveling around [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=205.68s)]
*  Northern Virginia in recent days on some stories, you can just hear from federal employees all of [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=209.84s)]
*  this concern about these new rules and these new proposals. It's disruptive, to say the least, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=214.0s)]
*  for some of them. Appreciate your reporting. Catherine Watson, come back soon. We will see [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=219.68s)]
*  you again with, I'm sure, a lot more to report on in these executive orders. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGvMZ17Qs18&t=223.92000000000002s)]
