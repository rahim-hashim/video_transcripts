# Layoffs, budget cuts could soon hit Defense Department
**CBS News:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w)
*  Welcome back. Question. Could the Defense Department be next on the list of the Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=0.0s)]
*  administration's efforts to wage what it calls a war on waste? That's a quote. The Washington [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=4.7s)]
*  Post in this context is reporting that the administration has directed defense agencies [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=11.86s)]
*  to submit a list of probationary employees and do so quickly. Some of those on that probationary [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=17.04s)]
*  list once submitted could be terminated as soon as this week. Barbara Starr joins me [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=23.26s)]
*  now. She is a long-time Pentagon correspondent and is currently a senior fellow for the University [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=28.54s)]
*  of Southern California's Annenberg Center on Communication, Leadership and Policy. Barbara, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=34.3s)]
*  my notes tell me that there are about 950,000 civilian employees with the Department of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=40.42s)]
*  Defense. The budget last year, about $840 billion. There probably is some room for efficiency [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=45.14s)]
*  there. But these probationary notices and the idea that significant firings could occur [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=52.14s)]
*  as soon as this week, how does that land with you? What are the implications of that? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=58.019999999999996s)]
*  Well, I don't think, as you say, it's a huge surprise to anybody. I can tell you there's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=62.62s)]
*  plenty of four-star generals and admirals in the force who also think there's room [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=67.7s)]
*  for budget cuts. It's a lot of money. And nobody, I think, is opposing what they believe, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=72.28s)]
*  and everyone has an opinion. Of course, there are sensible budget cuts. But there's something [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=79.53999999999999s)]
*  else going on here in Washington, and that's Congress. Because the way the Pentagon budget [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=83.52s)]
*  is designed, these weapons programs are manufactured in any number of states across the country. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=87.96s)]
*  And why is that? So you have senators and congressmen who have jobs in their districts [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=96.19999999999999s)]
*  that they want to protect, and they typically do not take kindly to massive budget cuts. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=101.16s)]
*  They want to protect those manufacturing defense jobs in their districts. So there's going [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=107.44s)]
*  to be a long way to go to get this all done. As for the probationary employees, this is [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=112.36s)]
*  something that is really having such an impact across the federal workforce. So many people [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=119.64s)]
*  suddenly losing jobs that they thought they had and having to find a way to earn a living. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=127.48s)]
*  And Barbara, in the context here, I think there are two P's, personnel at the Defense [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=132.6s)]
*  Department and procurement. You know better than I do that procurement is where the real [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=136.12s)]
*  money is. And there are ways to find weapons systems that can be manufactured more efficiently, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  less costly. It's been a constant story at the Pentagon. That's where the real money [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=145.44s)]
*  is, isn't it? Well, it is. And if you're going to save that real money, you have to make [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=149.12s)]
*  substantial cuts in like individual weapons programs, such as doing away with a new aircraft, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  a new fighter jet, a new tank. You can't just nibble around the edges. You have to make [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=162.96s)]
*  significant cuts in significant places. And I don't think there's anybody who thinks [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  there may not be room for that. But again, those defense manufacturing jobs, that's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  bread and butter for both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill. They're going to want to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=178.4s)]
*  preserve those jobs. So Pete Hegseth, the new Secretary of Defense, is going to have [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=183.12s)]
*  to really go a long way towards convincing Congress that the strategy the Pentagon has [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=188.44s)]
*  can do without these new weapons systems. This is going to go far beyond the message [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=196.2s)]
*  points and the sort of PR discussion we've been hearing from Hegseth so far. Now the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=200.8s)]
*  rubber meets the road. He's going to have to explain what the defense strategy is behind [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=206.84s)]
*  these potential cuts. And there have been some shock effects that the Department of [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=212.4s)]
*  Government Efficiencies has had to recall rehiring people on Nuclear Weapons Watch, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=216.52s)]
*  rehiring some people dealing with bird flu at the Department of Agriculture. If there [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=221.04s)]
*  are these 30 percent cuts in personnel at the Defense Department and they're done with [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=224.8s)]
*  the sort of breathtaking speed that they've occurred at other agencies, might that have [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=230.08s)]
*  some effect on issues related to national security? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=234.4s)]
*  Well, I think inevitably it will. You know, again, as you point out, the nuclear infrastructure [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  in the country, will that be protected? Will the rapid response forces across the world [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  that would deal with a crisis in Korea, a crisis in the Middle East, a crisis beyond [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=253.56s)]
*  what we have with Ukraine and Europe, will those be protected? Will families be protected? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=258.96s)]
*  Remember, when Pete Hegseth just several days ago went to Germany to visit the troops, very [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=264.6s)]
*  unusual. He walked onto a base in Germany and he was greeted with protesters from the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=270.28s)]
*  families, the U.S. military families who live there. So everyone is watching this very carefully. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=276.52s)]
*  Barbara Starr, thank you very much for your time and always your expertise. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OZzjPws_w&t=281.92s)]
