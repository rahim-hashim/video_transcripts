# How could Elon Musk influence Donald Trump?
**CBS News:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw)
*  also seen the remarkable gathering of people here in Washington, including these tech titans [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=0.0s)]
*  that gathered that had better seats than most members of Congress and even the president's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  incoming cabinet. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  You see them here. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  These are the world's richest men who had the best seats in the House there in the Capitol [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  Rotunda. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=19.46s)]
*  You see Elon Musk there, the CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai, Jeff Bezos and his fianc√© [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  Lauren Sanchez. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=29.36s)]
*  And then you can see Mark Zuckerberg there of Metta with his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=30.36s)]
*  All of them just some of the notable businessmen and then also the head of LVMH, Bernard Arnoir [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=36.64s)]
*  and his family. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=43.76s)]
*  Also, I believe the third or fourth richest man in the world. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=44.76s)]
*  So all gathered here. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=48.64s)]
*  And so we heard from President Biden in his departing remarks from the Oval Office the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=50.14s)]
*  other night. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=56.54s)]
*  And we were all so informed about a tech oligarchy. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=57.66s)]
*  And so for more on what that may mean, let's bring in Walter Isaacson. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=60.58s)]
*  Walter is a Tulane University professor and also wrote the biography on Elon Musk. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=64.66s)]
*  And Walter, so good to see you. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=72.14s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=74.34s)]
*  Thank you, Nora. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=76.06s)]
*  Boy, you saw that tech oligarchy right there, didn't you? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=77.06s)]
*  That was the words of President Biden. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=81.18s)]
*  He called them that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=83.3s)]
*  Certainly a powerful collection of individuals here to witness in person Trump's inauguration [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=84.3s)]
*  and those I didn't mention that you can see here too, including the CEO of TikTok and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=91.42s)]
*  then Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=96.34s)]
*  And let me ask you, Walter, because how many hours did you spend with Elon Musk? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=99.89999999999999s)]
*  I spent most of the time for two years, morning, noon and night, because you could see all [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=105.1s)]
*  of this developing. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=110.5s)]
*  What he's going to do in government, there's a whole playbook, and he's been doing it [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=111.96s)]
*  for 20 years, both in terms of going too far sometimes and causing rubble in his wake, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=115.6s)]
*  but also trying to get rid of every rule and regulation and make things happen fast. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=122.32s)]
*  And I think that's what he's planning to do in this new role as being the advisor on [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=126.91999999999999s)]
*  government efficiency. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  And let me ask you, because Elon Musk has arguably become one of the closest advisors [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  and confidants of Donald Trump. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=138.84s)]
*  He's there a lot at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=141.36s)]
*  How did that relationship come to be? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=143.32s)]
*  Well it came to be rather quickly in terms of it being in the past year, because when [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=145.72s)]
*  I was traveling around with Musk, he didn't have a whole lot of respect for Trump. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=151.12s)]
*  As you know, he supported Ron DeSantis. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=156.04s)]
*  He said, Trump is a charlatan. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, he's a carnival barker. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=160.04s)]
*  He reminds me of my father, is what Musk said. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=161.4s)]
*  And if you know from the book, it begins with this difficult relationship Musk has with [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=164.84s)]
*  his father. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=169.96s)]
*  And then Musk almost finds a substitute there, becomes fascinated with Trump, especially [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=171.4s)]
*  because he felt Biden had done too many regulations in the COVID crackdown. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=177.18s)]
*  Biden had not invited him to the electric vehicle summit. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=182.24s)]
*  And also what he calls the woke mind virus. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=186.44s)]
*  When I was traveling around with him, there's a scene in which there's a message from his [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=189.42000000000002s)]
*  first born child saying, I'm transitioning and my new name is Jenna. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=194.04s)]
*  And that got Musk onto this kick about what he calls the woke mind virus. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=199.0s)]
*  Elon Musk, I think arguably a genius, also eccentric in many ways, but a pioneer in so [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=204.44s)]
*  many different avenues. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  I do want to ask you, I spoke with a friend of his recently, he said, what's wrong with [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  having someone as smart as Elon Musk in government trying to eliminate waste? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=218.85999999999999s)]
*  That would be a good thing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=223.04s)]
*  What do you think, though, would be some of the challenges? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=224.38s)]
*  Well, look, everything he's done, he's been able to do things like eliminate waste. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=226.28s)]
*  There are little scenes in the book about the latches that the military had you put [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=232.44s)]
*  on space because he said, no, let's just get the latch off of the bathroom door stall. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=237.6s)]
*  We can do it at one thousandth of the price. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=242.18s)]
*  Well, that generally works well, but sometimes you cause problems. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=244.48s)]
*  And I think Musk is really going to go full bore. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=250.0s)]
*  People have no clue of what this sort of flamethrower mentality that he shows throughout of his [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=255.54s)]
*  life, how that's going to affect government. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=261.68s)]
*  Obviously, there's probably a good side to that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=264.84s)]
*  There's a lot of paralysis in government, but you're going to see Rubble, just like [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=267.28s)]
*  you see Rubble every time he tries to invent a new rocket. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=271.82s)]
*  The book has him doing the first Falcon launches, Rubble in his wake. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=275.72s)]
*  Eventually, though, he gets to orbit. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=279.8s)]
*  You know, Walter, I read your book. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=283.0s)]
*  It's called Elon Musk, by the way. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=285.04s)]
*  I read the book from cover to cover, and it really is a good read. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=287.0s)]
*  And you mentioned Elon being a flamethrower. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=291.08000000000004s)]
*  And my thing is, is we talked to a lot of people out on the streets who said, we know [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  he's brilliant, we know he's a genius, we know he's smart, but they're also a very they're [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=297.0s)]
*  very afraid of him. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=300.68s)]
*  They say he has very close access to the president. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=302.20000000000005s)]
*  Does he only care about the power? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=305.32s)]
*  When you think about that, did you see that kind of thinking that he wanted this kind [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=307.79999999999995s)]
*  of power? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=313.28s)]
*  Because now some people even call him President Musk, which which, of course, drives Donald [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=314.28s)]
*  Trump crazy. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=319.2s)]
*  Did you see this side of him wanting to get into politics? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=320.32s)]
*  Yeah, you and I talked about this when the book first came out, Gail. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=324.4s)]
*  I think that he's in some ways driven by larger forces than that. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  As you know, is a kid who's got no friends. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=333.71999999999997s)]
*  He's very lonely on the autism spectrum reading the X-Men comics, the superhero comics, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=337.36s)]
*  imagining him saving humanity. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=342.84s)]
*  So I think he's on he imagines himself almost as the avatar in his own video game. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=345.48s)]
*  And he's getting to play hero. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=350.64s)]
*  So I don't think this is about, hey, maybe getting tax credits for EVs, because as you [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=352.36s)]
*  saw, Trump's not going to keep those things going. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=356.56s)]
*  It's about I feel humanity is threatened. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=359.44s)]
*  I'm going to help us get to Mars. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=362.48s)]
*  I'm going to fight all the dark forces. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=364.28000000000003s)]
*  And when you got a sense of mission like that, it can be amazingly strong. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=367.12s)]
*  But as you said, it could also be dangerous. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=371.8s)]
*  Yeah. Do you think he and he and Donald Trump are a good team together? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=375.08000000000004s)]
*  Do you have concerns? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=378.44s)]
*  Knowing what you know, you know, you know, Elon very well. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's not exactly the most stable molecule because Elon has never really [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=383.48s)]
*  worked for anybody. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=388.72s)]
*  The only time he tried to a little bit is the beginning days of Tesla. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=390.28000000000003s)]
*  And that didn't work. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  And Donald Trump has not exactly shown himself to be an expert at sharing the limelight. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=394.48s)]
*  But my own prediction, as you can see how dedicated Musk is to this, Steve Bannon, the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=399.48s)]
*  head of the other wing of the populist MAGA, said, I'm going to get Musk gone by [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=405.72s)]
*  inauguration day. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=411.52s)]
*  Well, there you saw Elon Musk sitting in front of the secretary of commerce, sitting in [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=412.92s)]
*  front of the cabinet, Steve Bannon nowhere being around. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=419.4s)]
*  So I think there's at least a good year in which this Department of Government [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=422.64s)]
*  efficiency, you're going to see Elon doing in government what you saw him in the book [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=426.64s)]
*  doing to the private sector. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=432.08s)]
*  Walter, this is Margaret Brennan. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=434.56s)]
*  I too read your book, including the parts about Elon growing up in apartheid era [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=436.44s)]
*  South Africa. And I think that's so interesting that he is an immigrant to this country, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=441.96s)]
*  has taken on immigration as such a personal thing, even dabbling in European politics [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=446.8s)]
*  now on these anti-immigrant platforms. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=454.92s)]
*  He has even talked and gone to some pretty big rhetorical battles, at least with Steve [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=458.03999999999996s)]
*  Bannon, who you just mentioned there over H-1B visas and bringing skilled workers into [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=465.24s)]
*  the United States. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=469.96s)]
*  I'm wondering, where do you think this is going? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4FL9rMXgPw&t=471.88s)]
