# Inside the court hearing on whether to drop charges against NYC Mayor Eric Adams
**CBS News:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo)
*  The judge has concluded a hearing in Manhattan this afternoon on whether to allow the Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=0.0s)]
*  Justice Department to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=3.92s)]
*  Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Boves says the charges, quote, restricted Mayor [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=8.88s)]
*  Adams' ability to devote full attention and resources to legal immigration and violent [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=14.0s)]
*  crime. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=19.16s)]
*  The mayor pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and bribery in September and has denied [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=20.16s)]
*  any kind of quid pro quo deal with the DOJ. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=24.2s)]
*  CBS News Justice Department correspondent Scott McFarland joins us now from outside [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=27.4s)]
*  the courthouse. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=31.32s)]
*  Scott, you are inside the courthouse. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=32.32s)]
*  What happened? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=33.96s)]
*  A marathon, 90-minute hearing that concludes without a resolution. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=34.96s)]
*  The judge here, Dale Ho, says he needs some time to unpack everything he just heard, calling [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=41.28s)]
*  it a complicated matter and one that requires further review. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=45.72s)]
*  And this really is complicated, Lindsay. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=49.92s)]
*  Unequivocally, this is unprecedented. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=51.8s)]
*  You have the Department of Justice closely aligned with President Trump. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=54.04s)]
*  It's President Trump's one-time defense lawyer arguing for the Department of Justice, Emil [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=58.32s)]
*  Boves, and the defense team for Mayor Adams on the same page, making the same argument [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=62.48s)]
*  that this case should be dropped, that it is complicating Mayor Adams' ability to be [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=69.0s)]
*  the mayor, to get national security briefings, to get sensitive information, and to help [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=73.2s)]
*  President Trump with immigration enforcement. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=77.8s)]
*  The judge recognizes there was nobody in the courtroom today arguing on behalf of the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=80.80000000000001s)]
*  citizens of New York who may feel victimized by the alleged crimes of Mayor Adams. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=85.04s)]
*  So he's considering, the judge is considering bringing in an outside counsel, an outside [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=91.04s)]
*  attorney to make a case to help the judge, as he said, sharpen his arguments and sharpen [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=95.36s)]
*  the decision that will come. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=102.04s)]
*  So as of now, Mayor Eric Adams remains charged with federal corruption charges. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=103.84s)]
*  The case has not been dismissed, but it's also worth noting, Lindsay, the judge clarified, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=108.84s)]
*  for everybody's benefit in the courtroom, that the Department of Justice will withhold [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=114.36s)]
*  the ability to bring this case back in the future, if and when they so choose. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=118.16s)]
*  And that's always been a sticking point. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=123.24s)]
*  Critics say this puts Mayor Eric Adams under the thumb of the President of the United States, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=125.8s)]
*  indefinitely. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=130.84s)]
*  Scott, do we know the timeline on this? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=131.84s)]
*  If the judge is mulling over possibly bringing in another party that would be counseled [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=134.72s)]
*  to represent the side of the citizens? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=141.0s)]
*  We don't know the timing. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  I think I speak with confidence when I say everybody with their looks in the courtroom [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=146.28s)]
*  were trying to ask the court that non-verbally. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=149.96s)]
*  When are you getting back to us here, Your Honor? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=151.68s)]
*  But he didn't specify. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  I think that underscores the significance of this case and the uniqueness of the circumstances. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  He's going to need some time to unpack this. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  But I think it's easily measured in days, not weeks. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=163.36s)]
*  He acknowledged there is a time sensitivity to all of this. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=166.32000000000002s)]
*  The mayor is trying to run the city. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=169.88000000000002s)]
*  There's a primary election in which the mayor is running in June. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=171.8s)]
*  And this thing was supposed to go to trial in late April. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=175.4s)]
*  This is a decision we expect in the coming days, at a minimum. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=178.56s)]
*  We've been showing video of Mayor Adams leaving the courtroom, all smiles. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  What can you tell us about the color inside the courtroom, given that no cameras are allowed [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=186.88000000000002s)]
*  in federal court? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  The judge asked the mayor some direct questions about his understanding of all this, his understanding [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  of what the court is asking or what the prosecutors are asking. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=198.4s)]
*  There were a couple moments, in fact, Lindsay, where the judge called Mayor Eric Adams Mr. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=202.16s)]
*  Adams, then quickly corrected himself and said, sorry, Mayor Adams. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  Eric Adams answered a few questions here. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=211.64s)]
*  And I think what was most explicit from the words of the defense attorney was an explicit [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=213.6s)]
*  denial of the quid pro quo that was alleged by a former prosecutor on this case. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=219.0s)]
*  You'll recall the acting top prosecutor in the Southern District of New York resigned [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=224.56s)]
*  her post and protested the handling of this case by her bosses, saying there would seem [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=229.28s)]
*  to be a quid pro quo where the defense agreed to help out the president if the president's [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=234.2s)]
*  Justice Department agreed to dismiss the case. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=239.48s)]
*  They denied those allegations, both the prosecutors and defense did, before the judge late today. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=242.0s)]
*  Did the judge seem to give any subtle inferences about what he perceived from the arguments [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=246.68s)]
*  of the Department of Justice, essentially that dropping the charges include fighting [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=257.48s)]
*  the weaponization of criminal justice? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=262.6s)]
*  And I don't know how big of an argument either Adams' attorneys or the government made about [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=265.2s)]
*  this impeding his ability to do his job and run the city. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=271.72s)]
*  Yeah, the judge pressed the prosecutor on that, but I'd say he pressed the prosecutor [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=276.2s)]
*  gently on it, referring to one of the previous filings in this case in which the Department [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=279.96s)]
*  of Justice more explicitly detailed why they think this case should go. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=287.34s)]
*  And the prosecutor begged off that question and said, now look at this most recent filing. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=291.2s)]
*  Here's the argument we're presenting today, which was broader, that there's concerns about [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=295.56s)]
*  national security with the mayor being prosecuted, his inability to get national security information [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=300.48s)]
*  and the allegation that the Department of Justice was weaponized in bringing this case [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  in the first place, invoking the term so often used by President Trump that there's a weaponization [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=309.56s)]
*  they're trying to end. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=314.6s)]
*  That motion filed more recently is what they're submitting to the court to consider. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=316.64s)]
*  And the judge acknowledged that argument, but said he needs time to think through it, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=320.08000000000004s)]
*  look through it, have the rest of his questions answered. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=325.64s)]
*  Scott, what's the possibility of any other cases nationwide being looked at through this [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=328.6s)]
*  similar lens? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=333.0s)]
*  In other words, what impact, if any, could this case and the case being dropped against [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=334.0s)]
*  Mayor Adams have on other cases that might not be out of Manhattan? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=338.8s)]
*  This could very much reverberate around the country, which is why I think there's such [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=344.24s)]
*  outsized interest here. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=347.4s)]
*  This remains an enormous story in the largest city in America, but it's bigger than that, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=348.88s)]
*  Lindsay. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=353.52s)]
*  Questions in court today from the judge communicated that as well. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=354.52s)]
*  Would this be the type of thing that could be done in other cases across the country [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=357.8s)]
*  You have a high ranking official with a security clearance, and now he or she should be pulled [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=362.04s)]
*  away from a prosecution to help him or her do their jobs back at home. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=366.56s)]
*  Prosecutors, the Department of Justice said, yes, this is something we might do elsewhere. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=371.12s)]
*  But I think inside the Department of Justice, from our sources, there's a different concern [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=375.56s)]
*  that there seem to be, according to critics, political motivations here by Trump allies [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=379.44000000000005s)]
*  at the Department of Justice, and that this case falls for a political interest. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=383.8s)]
*  But that could compromise criminal cases around the country. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=387.92s)]
*  Prosecutors may be more hesitant, Lindsay, to bring a case against a Trump ally in the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=391.76s)]
*  future, not wanting to go through this. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=395.64s)]
*  Scott McFarland, thank you so much. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDmIKgoQNo&t=399.28s)]
