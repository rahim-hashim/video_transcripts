# Sen. Kelly on Hegseth's apparent alcohol abuse at work functions
**CBS News:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA)
*  Mr. Hegseth, thank you for being here today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you for your service to this country. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=2.44s)]
*  Thank you, Senator. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=4.8s)]
*  Few nominees come into this room with all [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=5.8s)]
*  the necessary experience to do this job, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=8.16s)]
*  to be Secretary of Defense. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=10.56s)]
*  We get that. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=11.8s)]
*  It's a reflection on just how big of a job this is. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=13.4s)]
*  What I want to understand is whether or not [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=18.2s)]
*  you bring any of the necessary experience [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=20.56s)]
*  that this job requires. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=23.64s)]
*  And here's where I'm concerned. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=26.28s)]
*  Senator Coleman, in introducing you, and this is a quote, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=28.56s)]
*  he said, he has struggled and overcome [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=32.32s)]
*  great personal challenges, unquote. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=35.6s)]
*  You walk in here saying that you've [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=39.16s)]
*  had personal and character issues in your past, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=40.86s)]
*  including heavy drinking, which you wrote about. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=44.32s)]
*  And you said, and this is a quote from you, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=47.96s)]
*  that you said, I sit before you as an open book. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=50.28s)]
*  Yet you haven't actually said what personal challenges it [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=55.8s)]
*  is that you've overcome when you've been asked about them. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=60.16s)]
*  So I'm going to give you an opportunity here [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=63.48s)]
*  to be as forthright as you say you want to be. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=65.39999999999999s)]
*  So while leading concerned veterans of America, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  there were very specific cases cited by individuals [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=72.74s)]
*  about your conduct. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=76.0s)]
*  I'm going to go through a few of them. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=77.47999999999999s)]
*  And I just want you to tell me if these are true or false. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=79.56s)]
*  Very simple. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=84.38s)]
*  Memorial Day 2014 at a CVA event in Virginia, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=85.32s)]
*  you needed to be carried out of the event [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=89.91999999999999s)]
*  for being intoxicated. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=92.25999999999999s)]
*  Senator Anonymous, smears. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  Just true or false? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  Very simple. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=99.88s)]
*  Summer of 2014 in Cleveland, drunk in public with the CVA [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  team. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=105.28s)]
*  Anonymous, smears. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=107.32s)]
*  I'm just asking for true or false answers. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=109.0s)]
*  An event in North Carolina, drunk [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=112.84s)]
*  in front of three young female staff members [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  after you had instituted a no alcohol policy [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  and then reversed it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=120.88000000000001s)]
*  True or false? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=122.0s)]
*  Anonymous, smears. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=123.44s)]
*  December of 2014 at the CVA Christmas party [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  at the Grand Hyatt at Washington, DC, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=127.78s)]
*  you were noticeably intoxicated and had [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=130.46s)]
*  to be carried up to your room. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=133.44s)]
*  Is that true or false? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=135.8s)]
*  Anonymous, smears. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=137.52s)]
*  Another time a CVA staffer stated [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=139.04s)]
*  that you passed out in the back of a party bus. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=141.12s)]
*  Is that true or false? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=144.67999999999998s)]
*  Anonymous, smears. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=146.44s)]
*  In 2014, while in Louisiana on official business for CVA, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=148.44s)]
*  did you take your staff, including [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  young female staff members, to a strip club? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=156.68s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=160.44s)]
*  Anonymous, smears. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=161.56s)]
*  So is it accurate that the organization reached [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=163.56s)]
*  a financial settlement with a female staffer who [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  claimed to be at a strip club with you, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  and there was a colleague who attempted to sexually assault [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=181.0s)]
*  her? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  Was there a financial settlement? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=185.6s)]
*  Senator, I was not involved in that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=189.0s)]
*  I don't know the nature of how that played out. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  But you understand there was a financial settlement [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=194.84s)]
*  for a young female staffer who accused [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=197.72s)]
*  other member of the organization, not you, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  of sexual assault in a strip club? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  We have multiple statements on the record referring to that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  But you claim you were not there when that occurred? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=211.76s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=215.0s)]
*  Now, the behavior I cited, if true, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=215.72s)]
*  do you think that this behavior of intoxication, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=219.56s)]
*  going into these type of establishments, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=223.84s)]
*  women on your staff being so uncomfortable [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=227.0s)]
*  that they have to file these sort of harassment claims, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=229.24s)]
*  do you think this is appropriate behavior for a leader? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=231.76s)]
*  Senator, the overwhelming majority [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  of anyone who's worked for me, including [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=240.92s)]
*  the on-the-record statements that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=243.04s)]
*  have been submitted with their name on it, on the record, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=244.24s)]
*  men and women who worked with me every day [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=247.12s)]
*  are the overwhelming preponderance of evidence [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=249.96s)]
*  that testify to my leadership and professionalism [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  in leading Vets for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for America. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=256.36s)]
*  My leadership has been completely impugned [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=259.36s)]
*  on these veterans' organizations that did fantastic work. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=261.88s)]
*  Mr. Hegseth, I'm not even going to go into the accusation. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=265.52s)]
*  I'm not even going to go into the accusation. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=267.44s)]
*  I'm not even going to go into the accusation. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=269.6s)]
*  I'm not even going to go into the accusations. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=271.44s)]
*  And we manage our financial books [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=273.16s)]
*  with integrity across the board. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=274.68s)]
*  Everybody who runs the campaign. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=277.0s)]
*  I have limited time. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=278.24s)]
*  I'm not going to get into the accusations that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=279.32s)]
*  come from Fox News. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=281.92s)]
*  Some of your Fox News colleagues here, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=283.16s)]
*  there are multiple instances of accusations against you [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=285.16s)]
*  about drinking on the job, coming in. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=288.76s)]
*  All anonymous, all false, all refuted by my colleagues, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=291.6s)]
*  who I worked with for 10 years, at 6 AM to 9 PM, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=294.44s)]
*  and everything in between. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=298.76s)]
*  For me, Mr. Hegseth, is when there [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=299.88s)]
*  is discussion about personal challenges, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=303.48s)]
*  and you admittedly had issues with heavy drinking, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=306.36s)]
*  it's hard to kind of square this, to square the circle here. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=310.92s)]
*  It's kind of a difficult thing to do. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=314.76s)]
*  Let me ask you, I have about 90 seconds left here. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=317.4s)]
*  If you had to answer these questions about sexual assault [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=322.92s)]
*  against you and your drinking and your personal conduct, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=326.48s)]
*  would it have been different if you were under oath? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=329.48s)]
*  Senator, all I'm pointing out is the false claims against me. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=333.8s)]
*  OK, I do not want to answer that question. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=338.76s)]
*  I walked into this hearing this morning [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=340.8s)]
*  concerned that you haven't demonstrated [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=343.8s)]
*  adequate leadership in your civilian roles. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  And this is a dangerous world we're living in here. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=350.64000000000004s)]
*  And America cannot afford a Secretary of Defense [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=353.16s)]
*  who is unprepared for that mission. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=356.52000000000004s)]
*  I'm going to leave with concerns about your transparency. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=358.8s)]
*  You say you've had personal issues in your past. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=362.24s)]
*  Yet when asked about those very issues, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=365.08s)]
*  you blame an anonymous smear campaign, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=367.12s)]
*  even when many of these claims are not anonymous. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=371.12s)]
*  Which is it? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=374.6s)]
*  Have you overcome personal issues? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=375.64s)]
*  Or are you the target of a smear campaign? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=378.12s)]
*  It can't be both. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=381.1s)]
*  It's clear to me that you're not being honest with us [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqgMwp8XwA&t=382.92s)]
