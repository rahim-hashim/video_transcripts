# U.S. pauses immigration applications for certain migrants welcomed under Biden
**CBS News:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI)
*  CBS News has exclusively learned that the Trump administration has paused all immigration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=0.0s)]
*  applications filed by migrants from Latin America and Ukraine. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=4.46s)]
*  They were allowed into the United States under certain Biden era programs. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=7.92s)]
*  CBS News immigration and politics reporter Camilo Montoya Galvez joins me right here [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=12.0s)]
*  in studio 55. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=16.16s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=17.16s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=18.16s)]
*  Good to see you here. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=19.16s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=20.16s)]
*  So you've obtained this internal memo about that decision. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=21.16s)]
*  Break it down for me. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=22.16s)]
*  Well, the Trump administration is arguing in this memo, Vlad, that it needs to suspend [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=23.16s)]
*  programs because of concerns about fraud and also to be able to determine whether any of [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=28.42s)]
*  the migrants who were allowed into the U.S. under these Biden administration policies [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=34.260000000000005s)]
*  could potentially pose a threat to public safety or national security. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=38.900000000000006s)]
*  And we're talking about hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians and also migrants from other [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=43.78s)]
*  crisis-stricken countries like Haiti, Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, who again were allowed [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=48.22s)]
*  into the U.S. under President Biden, but only on a temporary basis. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=53.7s)]
*  And so many of them have been applying for something called TPS, temporary protected [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=57.94s)]
*  status, asylum or a green card because they have a U.S. employer or relative who is willing [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=61.7s)]
*  to sponsor them. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=67.22s)]
*  Those applications now are suspended indefinitely. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=68.34s)]
*  So two questions. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=72.38s)]
*  What is what are the groups that offer legal representation to these groups saying and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=73.46000000000001s)]
*  what they're being told by the Trump administration? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=78.46000000000001s)]
*  And if you already have TPS, what does that mean? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=80.64s)]
*  So if you already have temporary protected status, you will not be affected by this recent [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=84.64s)]
*  memo and decision by the Trump administration. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  But it is critically important to note that the Trump administration is in the process [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=92.24s)]
*  of scaling back many TPS programs, including the one for Venezuelans. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=96.5s)]
*  And it already announced that it is terminating TPS protections for more than 300,000 Venezuelan [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=101.16s)]
*  migrants. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  Many of these programs are at risk of being terminated because the administration, Vlad, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  believes that these policies have been abused by Democratic administrations and that they [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  have been in place for too long. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=116.68s)]
*  And with regards to those legal groups that are offering the representation and the guidance [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  to these migrant children, what are they being told about what they should do? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=124.06s)]
*  So that is a separate policy change that came down yesterday to the Trump administration. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=127.44s)]
*  And Vlad has directed the legal services organizations that provide legal counsel to unaccompanied [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  children in U.S. custody to halt that work that they do with federal funding. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  And so now we are told that lawyers who conduct know your rights presentations and legal screenings [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  of children who arrive in the U.S. without their parents or legal guardians and undocumented [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=148.16s)]
*  will no longer happen. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=153.48s)]
*  And it is also going to impact, we are told, their efforts to represent these minors in [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=155.6s)]
*  immigration court because just like migrant adults, they face deportation and judges have [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=161.36s)]
*  to decide whether or not they are able to stay here legally. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=166.0s)]
*  And now the attorneys tell me that is going to be very hard for children to make their [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=169.36s)]
*  case in court because, one, they are minors, but they're also in a foreign country without [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=174.36s)]
*  access to lawyers potentially now. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  All right, Camilo, with that breaking news for us, thank you very much. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=180.84s)]
*  Excusive reporting as always. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=183.96s)]
*  Thank you, Camilo. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q9p5nrxbI&t=185.60000000000002s)]
