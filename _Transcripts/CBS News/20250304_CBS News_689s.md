# Trump says his administration is "reclaiming the Panama Canal"
**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0)
*  To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=0.0s)]
*  and we've already started doing it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=7.44s)]
*  Yesterday, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=17.44s)]
*  and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=25.76s)]
*  The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others, but others could use [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=31.28s)]
*  it. But it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure. 38,000 workers died [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=38.56s)]
*  building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria. They died of snake bites and mosquitoes. Not a nice [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=45.68s)]
*  place to work. They paid them very highly to go there, knowing there was a 25 percent [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=53.199999999999996s)]
*  chance that they would die. The most expensive project also that was ever built in our country's [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  history of you bringing up to modern-day costs. It was given away by the Carter administration [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=65.52s)]
*  for one dollar, but that agreement has been violated very severely. We didn't give it to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=71.12s)]
*  China. We gave it to Panama and we're taking it back. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=77.84s)]
*  And we have Marco Rubio in charge. Good luck, Marco. Now we know who to blame if anything goes [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=94.64s)]
*  wrong. Marco's been amazing and he's going to do a great job. Think of it. He got 100 votes. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=103.04s)]
*  You know, he was approved with actually 99, but the 100th was this gentleman and I feel very [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=112.4s)]
*  certain. So let's assume he got 100 votes and I'm either very, very happy about that or I'm very [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=119.28s)]
*  concerned about it. But he's already proven. I mean, he's a great gentleman. He's respected [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=124.56s)]
*  by everybody and we appreciate your voting for Marco. He's going to do a fantastic job. Thank you. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=130.72s)]
*  Thank you. He's doing a great job. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=136.4s)]
*  Great job. And I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=144.24s)]
*  We strongly support your right to determine your own future [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=153.92s)]
*  and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America. We need Greenland for national [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=158.4s)]
*  security and even international security and we're working with everybody involved to try and get it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=164.8s)]
*  But we need it really for international world security and I think we're going to get it [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=170.72s)]
*  one way or the other. We're going to get it. We will keep you safe. We will make you rich and together. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=176.88s)]
*  We will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  It's a very small population, but very, very large piece of land and very, very important for [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=190.08s)]
*  military security. America is once again standing strong against the forces of radical Islamic [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=197.36s)]
*  terrorism. Three and a half years ago, ISIS terrorists killed 13 American service members [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=204.0s)]
*  and countless others in the Abbey Gate bombing during the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=210.24s)]
*  from Afghanistan. Not that they were withdrawing, it was the way they withdrew. Perhaps the most [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=216.88s)]
*  embarrassing moment in the history of our country. Tonight I am pleased to announce that we have just [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=224.0s)]
*  apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity and he is right now on his way here to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=230.16s)]
*  face the swift sword of American justice. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=237.6s)]
*  And I want to thank especially the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=247.76s)]
*  This was a very momentous day for those 13 families who I actually got to know very well, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  most of them, whose children were murdered and the many people that were so badly, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=276.48s)]
*  over 42 people, so badly injured on that fateful day in Afghanistan. What a horrible day. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=282.88s)]
*  Such incompetence was shown that when Putin saw what happened, I guess he said, wow, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=290.88s)]
*  maybe this is my chance. That's how bad it was. Should have never happened. Grossly incompetent [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=298.08000000000004s)]
*  people. I spoke to many of the parents and loved ones and they're all in our hearts tonight. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=304.4s)]
*  Spoke to them on the phone. We had a big call. Every one of them called and everybody was on [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  the line and they did nothing but cry with happiness. They were very happy, as happy as [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=320.4s)]
*  you can be under those circumstances. Their child, brother, sister, son, daughter was [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=326.16s)]
*  killed for no reason whatsoever. In the Middle East, we're bringing back our hostages from Gaza. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=336.24s)]
*  In my first term, we achieved one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=343.76000000000005s)]
*  in generations, the Abraham Accords. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=348.32s)]
*  And now we're going to build on that foundation to create a more peaceful and prosperous future [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=369.36s)]
*  for the entire region. A lot of things are happening in the Middle East. People haven't [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=374.96s)]
*  been talking about that so much lately with everything going on with Ukraine and Russia, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=378.4s)]
*  but a lot of things are happening in the Middle East. It's a rough neighborhood, actually. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm also working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine. Millions of Ukrainians and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  Russians have been needlessly killed or wounded in this horrific and brutal conflict with no end [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=395.44s)]
*  in sight. The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=402.16s)]
*  Ukraine's defense with no security, with no anything. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=409.20000000000005s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=415.28s)]
*  Do you want to keep it going for another five years? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=428.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, you would say Pocahontas says yes. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=431.67999999999995s)]
*  Two thousand people are being killed every single week. More than that. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=445.28s)]
*  They're Russian young people. They're Ukrainian young people. They're not Americans, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=452.55999999999995s)]
*  but I wanted to stop. Meanwhile, Europe has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=457.2s)]
*  than they have spent on defending Ukraine by far. Think of that. They've spent more buying Russian [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=464.32s)]
*  oil and gas than they have defending. And we've spent perhaps 350 billion dollars, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=471.52s)]
*  like taking candy from a baby. That's what happened. And they've spent a hundred billion [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=479.2s)]
*  dollars. What a difference that is. And we have an ocean separating us, and they don't. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=485.35999999999996s)]
*  But we're getting along very well with them and lots of good things are happening. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=492.64s)]
*  Biden has authorized more money in this fight than Europe has spent by billions and billions [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  of dollars. It's hard to believe that they wouldn't have stopped it and said at some point, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=505.68s)]
*  come on, let's equalize. You got to be equal to us. But that didn't happen. Earlier today, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=509.6s)]
*  I received an important letter from President Zelensky of Ukraine. The letter reads, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=514.96s)]
*  Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=520.96s)]
*  peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians, he said. My team and I stand [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=526.72s)]
*  ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts. We do [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=533.44s)]
*  really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=540.8000000000001s)]
*  Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=547.8399999999999s)]
*  at any time that is convenient for you. I appreciate that he sent this letter, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=552.64s)]
*  just got it a little while ago. Simultaneously, we've had serious discussions with Russia [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=559.52s)]
*  and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace. Wouldn't that be beautiful? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=565.76s)]
*  Wouldn't that be beautiful? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=577.04s)]
*  It's time to stop this madness. It's time to halt the killing. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=592.4s)]
*  It's time to end this senseless war. If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=596.8s)]
*  Nearly four years ago, amid rising tensions, a history teacher named Mark Fogle was detained [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=603.4399999999999s)]
*  in Russia and sentenced to 14 years in a penal colony. Rough stuff. The previous administration [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=610.4799999999999s)]
*  barely lifted a finger to help him. They knew he was innocent, but they had no idea where to begin. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=619.5999999999999s)]
*  But last summer, I promised his 95-year-old mother, Malfine, that we would bring her boy safely back [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=625.52s)]
*  home. After 22 days in office, I did just that, and they are here tonight. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=634.0799999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=654.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=661.6s)]
*  To Mark and his great mom, we are delighted to have you safe and sound and with us. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39r2T2ixJh0&t=682.24s)]
