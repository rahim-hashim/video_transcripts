# First Israeli hostages reunited with families as ceasefire between Israel and Hamas takes hold
**CBS News:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ)
*  You're my husband. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=0.0s)]
*  You're my husband. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=2.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=4.0s)]
*  Just an incredible moment there. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=6.0s)]
*  An Israeli woman reunited with her family after she was taken hostage more than a year ago. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=8.0s)]
*  Clearly, you can see how elated she is, the relief as she's embraced by her loved ones. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=15.0s)]
*  This woman was part of the first group of Israeli hostages released as part of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=21.0s)]
*  President-elect Trump has taken credit for securing that deal. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=28.0s)]
*  His team worked with the outgoing administration to secure the agreement at the end. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=31.0s)]
*  But keep in mind, President Biden pointed out the agreement was based on a plan his administration laid out last year. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=36.0s)]
*  But it now does fall on Trump's team to ensure the remaining phases are successful. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=43.0s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Rami Enosentio is following all the latest for us from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=49.0s)]
*  In Israel, in Gaza, and in the occupied West Bank, we saw more joy, if not at least relief, than we've seen in the past 15 months of war. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=55.0s)]
*  Here in Tel Aviv, those three Israeli hostages finally got to hug their families again, both in joy as well as in tears. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=65.0s)]
*  The youngest, Romy Gonen, 24, Emily Demary, 28, who showed off her hand, missing two fingers that were shot off, and Doron Steinbrecher, 31. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=74.0s)]
*  Hamas freed them at about sunset last night in Gaza City when their van door opened up. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=84.0s)]
*  They bolted to a waiting Red Cross car, then handed off to Israeli soldiers, and then helicoptered to a medical center here in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=90.0s)]
*  In hostage square, people watched on a big screen, and they cheered, and they finally let themselves smile. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=98.0s)]
*  In the West Bank, Palestinians celebrated too. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=105.0s)]
*  Israel released 90 detainees. That was in exchange for those three hostages. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=108.0s)]
*  About two-thirds of them were women. The rest men accused of a range of crimes, from throwing stones to supporting terror and to murder. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=112.0s)]
*  And then in Gaza, early Sunday morning, Palestinians there celebrated at 8.30 a.m. when the ceasefire was supposed to start. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=121.0s)]
*  But that's now giving way to, frankly, a nightmare ahead. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=128.0s)]
*  So many are fanning out back to what is like the ruins. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=132.0s)]
*  Close to 47,000 people have been killed in IDF strikes. That's according to the health ministry. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=139.0s)]
*  And it will take years and really billions to rebuild, provided the ceasefire holds. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=145.0s)]
*  So much loss on both sides over the past 470 days. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=150.0s)]
*  Day one of this fragile deal is over, but there is anxiety about whether it can hold. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=154.0s)]
*  And between sworn enemies, Hamas still holds 64 hostages, and that includes seven Americans. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdCPb6IJ_UQ&t=160.0s)]
