# Most Americans say income is not keeping up with inflation, CBS News poll finds
**CBS News:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM)
*  Welcome back to America Decides. Let's talk money. Your money, my money, everybody's money. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=0.0s)]
*  So the stock market has either been volatile or sliding downwards lately. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=4.5s)]
*  Consumer confidence index is also down. Unemployment claims slightly up. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=9.0s)]
*  CBS News executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto, he's your friend, he's my friend, joins us now. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=14.0s)]
*  Anthony, it's early days, but how do the data that you're looking at suggest people are absorbing early days [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=21.0s)]
*  of the Trump administration slash Trump economy? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=28.0s)]
*  You know what, Major? I am here with a sort of update to a continuing story, which is inflation, people say, is still affecting them. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=32.0s)]
*  Look at this. Almost two thirds of people say they look around them and that prices around them are still going up or staying the same. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=40.0s)]
*  Another third say that. And you mentioned all those macro numbers, right? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=47.0s)]
*  But we know that prices are the way that people process things because it's right up close to them, right? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=51.0s)]
*  Now, here's another part of this. Is your income keeping up with inflation? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=57.0s)]
*  Look at that big number, three quarters that say no, it isn't. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=62.0s)]
*  And that's a big reason why people say overall still that the national economy is bad. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=65.0s)]
*  I do want to point out this, too. And it's important. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=72.0s)]
*  If you look at what people are concerned about, the big top answer is saving and buying extra. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=75.0s)]
*  Yes, there's a slight majority who are worried about housing, which a lot of people call unaffordable, about paying their debts. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=83.0s)]
*  But this one strikes me because it's not just about meeting your day to day bills, which, of course, is important. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=88.0s)]
*  But also people are telling us they want to be able to save. They want to be able to get ahead. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=95.0s)]
*  And it's prices that's the number one reason they say that so many can't do it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=100.0s)]
*  And Anthony, is this in the data a Biden hangover or is it becoming a Trump problem? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=105.0s)]
*  Well, look, if you just look at the pattern, the percent saying the U.S. economy is bad, this is a story, like I mentioned, that has been ongoing since the pandemic. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=112.0s)]
*  Really, you go back to March 2020 and you see substantial numbers of people, majorities about the same level, saying the U.S. economy is bad. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=122.0s)]
*  So in that sense, it is continuing. But then you start looking ahead because, look, that's what confidence is all about. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=132.0s)]
*  Right. Will people spend money? Do they think things are going to get better, get worse? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=139.0s)]
*  You see more people right now saying they think things will get worse than get better. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=143.0s)]
*  That's particularly the case among people who say they're having more trouble making ends meet. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=147.0s)]
*  And you see a third, not most, but a third who think that things over the next year are going to start booming or growing. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=153.0s)]
*  So that's the confidence measure that we need to keep tracking from here, major. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=159.0s)]
*  Fascinating data always. Anthony Salvanto, my friend, thank you. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcggIfg-JiM&t=164.0s)]
