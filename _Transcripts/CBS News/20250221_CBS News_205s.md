# Details on Senate-passed GOP budget plan after "vote-a-rama"
**CBS News:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM)
*  Senate Republicans passed a budget resolution just a few hours ago after pulling an all-nighter through a process known as a vote-arama [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=0.0s)]
*  The measure is aimed at jump-starting president Trump's legislative agenda [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=8.3s)]
*  CBS News congressional correspondent Nicole Killian joins us live from Capitol Hill with more on this [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=12.64s)]
*  Nicole certainly not your folks vote-arama as we were discussing earlier today [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=17.44s)]
*  But break down for us what was in this package and why lawmakers stayed up all night to get it done [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=21.14s)]
*  Yeah, well basically this is a budget resolution and it's designed to kind of unlock this process to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=27.52s)]
*  Expedite or a fast-track the president's legislative agenda [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=34.12s)]
*  So a big chunk of the money in this package about 175 billion will be airmarked for border security things like increasing [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=37.2s)]
*  Detention beds increasing staffing around the border especially as the president tries to enact his mass [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=44.92s)]
*  deportation plan and then it has about 150 billion dollars that will go towards a defense spending and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=50.56s)]
*  also [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=56.96s)]
*  Energy independence which has also been a priority of the president and part of the reason why they stayed up all night to do [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=57.980000000000004s)]
*  This is you know they wanted to get her done at least Senate Republicans did [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  But also generally speaking with kind of a bigger broader package like this [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=69.12s)]
*  It's not uncommon to see a lawmakers want to add various amendments and make some tweaks to it [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=73.36s)]
*  So in that process you have a vote upon vote on these different amendments [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=79.34s)]
*  The strategy at least for Senate Democrats was to try to use that as an opportunity to force [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=85.28s)]
*  Republicans to take some pretty hard votes on [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=90.2s)]
*  Some of these cuts that we're seeing the Trump administration make whether or not they back these cuts to the federal workforce [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  These cuts to federal agencies also, you know how far they're gonna go with some of these tax cuts what they're gonna use to pay [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=98.92s)]
*  For them will it be you know on the backs of the middle class? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=105.68s)]
*  There were some kind of more political [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=109.92s)]
*  Messaging types of amendments that were folded into this Voter Rama if you will [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=112.72s)]
*  Which is why even though many of them didn't pass [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=117.0s)]
*  But that's why the process was kind of drawn out and it took all night [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=119.16s)]
*  Did Nicole Killian just say get her done? This is why you watch CBS News 24-7 folks [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=122.64s)]
*  You never know how we will contextualize these important stories [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=128.2s)]
*  I know that the house still need to take up a budget bill as well Nicole. There are some differences [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=131.4s)]
*  Help us understand what that is because ultimately they'll need to be on the same page [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=136.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's right [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=140.76s)]
*  And you know we've talked a lot on this program about the president wanting this so-called one big beautiful bill [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=141.68s)]
*  Which is really kind of what the house plans to take up next week [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=147.0s)]
*  And so in addition to funding those border security priorities for instance energy proposals [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=150.42000000000002s)]
*  This also includes an extension or paying for an extension of the president's tax cuts [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  Which has also been a high priority for congressional Republicans and for the president [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  It also includes an increase in the debt limit as well because of course with more spending you're gonna need to increase [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=168.7s)]
*  The credit limit for the nation's credit card if you will so all of that is wrapped into a one big beautiful bill and certainly [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  While Senate Republicans support some of these ideas they felt it was easier to make you know have a narrower package and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  Do the tax cuts in a second bill the house on the other hand wanted to put this all in one because they may [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=189.44s)]
*  Just get one shot at this and so that's what they are taking up next week really interesting Nicole Killian [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=194.92s)]
*  Appreciate your reporting as always joining us from Capitol Hill [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhHRebVmhaM&t=201.76s)]
