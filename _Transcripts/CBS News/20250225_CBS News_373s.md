# Rep. Dusty Johnson defends GOP budget plan
**CBS News:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s)
*  Welcome back. Quick fact check here. The House budget plan includes recommendation language [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=0.0s)]
*  that could lead to significant reductions in future Medicaid spending. It directs the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=6.16s)]
*  committee that oversees the program, that's the Energy and Commerce Committee, to look [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=10.88s)]
*  for up to $880 billion in reductions over 10 years. Even so, House Speaker Mike Johnson [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=14.6s)]
*  made it sound today like that wasn't actually the case. Listen. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=21.6s)]
*  The leader just held up the resolution. Do a word search for yourself. It doesn't even [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=25.76s)]
*  mention Medicaid in the bill. So that's the important part. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=29.96s)]
*  South Dakota Republican Congressman Dusty Johnson joins us now. Congressman, great to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=34.32s)]
*  see you. Thanks for joining us. You know and I know that the speaker is technically correct [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=37.68s)]
*  that Medicaid isn't in the budget resolution, but the instructions are there. Many of your [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=44.08s)]
*  colleagues are nervous about the implications for future Medicaid funding. Do you share [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=48.72s)]
*  their concerns? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  Major, we can get to $880 billion of cuts within the jurisdiction of energy and commerce [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=56.48s)]
*  without cutting Medicare services, Medicaid services that people are receiving today. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  That can absolutely be done. How do you do that? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to give you an example from SNAP. That's the welfare program I know better, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=70.47999999999999s)]
*  but all of the same lessons can be the same in Medicaid. So for instance, I have a bill [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=75.19999999999999s)]
*  I introduced yesterday to strengthen the work requirements around able-bodied young people [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=79.24s)]
*  who are receiving food stamps or SNAP. Now this is not pregnant mothers, these are not [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=85.24s)]
*  seniors, these are not folks with disabilities, these are just people who can work and who [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  choose not to. You can save $100 billion a year on SNAP just by having better work requirements [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=95.36s)]
*  for the able-bodied. The same can be true in Medicaid. One more example from SNAP. You've [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  got states that have used ridiculous loopholes to exempt their entire state from the work [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=110.1s)]
*  requirements in SNAP. Closing those loopholes can save you $50 billion. And so you absolutely [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=115.33999999999999s)]
*  can start to build cost savings on integrity and on making sure that the wrong people don't [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=122.33999999999999s)]
*  get benefits. We absolutely need to have Medicaid. It's an incredibly powerful program. It should [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=128.38s)]
*  be focused on America's most needy. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=132.9s)]
*  Congressman, I was sent a couple of notes today by the National Rural Health Association. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=136.70000000000002s)]
*  They've been up on Capitol Hill. I may be talking to you, but certainly talking to other [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=142.02s)]
*  of your colleagues. And they said to me that in South Dakota, 50% of the rural hospitals [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=144.98000000000002s)]
*  there are financially stressed, they're facing workforce shortages, and they're uncertain [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=150.70000000000002s)]
*  about federal grants continuing under the Trump administration or this budget resolution. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=156.1s)]
*  Are you saying that none of their concerns are valid? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=161.38s)]
*  What I'm saying is that right now all we're doing with this vote this week is to unlock [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=164.9s)]
*  the budget, the reconciliation process. The resolution in and of itself doesn't do anything. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=172.06s)]
*  In and of itself, it doesn't cut a dollar. All it does is the kickoff for the four quarters [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=178.70000000000002s)]
*  of the football game to come. And that's, listen, of course they need to be their own [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=184.46s)]
*  advocates. Rural hospitals are incredibly important, and we want to make sure in the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=189.3s)]
*  final reconciliation work product that we are not closing rural hospitals. This vote [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=193.22s)]
*  today does not affect rural hospitals directly at all. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=198.42000000000002s)]
*  What is your sense right now this evening as we speak a little bit after 5 p.m. Eastern [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=204.06s)]
*  on where the votes are and if they will actually pass this evening? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=210.06s)]
*  We're making progress, but it is admittedly progress at a pretty slow pace. I've never [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=215.06s)]
*  been able to find 219 people to agree on anything, and of course that's the situation we're in. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=223.26s)]
*  We've got to have 218 out of 219. And it's going to be difficult. I'm not going to lie [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=229.06s)]
*  to you, but I just, I don't think failure is an option. And I think most members who [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=233.06s)]
*  are coming around to our side understand that we are $2 trillion upside down every single [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=238.34s)]
*  year. And there will be people who can tell you that, oh, if Republicans just raise taxes [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=244.01999999999998s)]
*  on the rich, we could solve the problem. The reality is that Joe Biden's billionaires' [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=248.01999999999998s)]
*  tax would only generate $50 billion a year, and we are $2,000 billion a year upside down. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=252.01999999999998s)]
*  There are people who want these cuts to come only from discretionary spending. You know [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=260.02s)]
*  as well as I do that you could literally zero out non-defense discretionary spending, and [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=264.02s)]
*  you wouldn't even cut the deficit annually in half. And so I get it. There are people [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=269.5s)]
*  who are uncomfortable any time brave men and women step up and want to make bold decisions [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=275.5s)]
*  to put us on the right path. The reality is the bankruptcy, insolvency beckons, and it [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=280.5s)]
*  is time for the big boys and the big girls to step up and vote yes tonight or tomorrow [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=286.5s)]
*  or whenever that gosh darn thing is on the floor. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=292.5s)]
*  That's been said many times in the House of Representatives. Speaking of the bravery that [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=295.98s)]
*  you just mentioned, President Trump has been pretty clear about Medicare. He doesn't want [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=299.98s)]
*  to touch Medicare, yet there has been extensive reporting, really excellent reporting from [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=304.98s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal about Medicare Advantage overcharging, doctors, hospitals manipulating [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=309.98s)]
*  the system, lots of discernible fraud built into that system. Why not go after that also? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=314.98s)]
*  Sometimes when people say whether it's the President or whether it's a Republican member [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=322.46000000000004s)]
*  when they say we're not going to touch Medicare, what they mean is we're not going to touch [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=326.46000000000004s)]
*  the Medicare benefits. We're not going to touch, or same thing with Social Security [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=331.46000000000004s)]
*  of course we can't do Social Security and reconciliation, but if somebody says we're [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=335.46000000000004s)]
*  not going to touch Social Security what they mean is the actual benefit received by the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=339.46000000000004s)]
*  senior. We should absolutely be willing to look at waste, fraud, and abuse if there are [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=343.46000000000004s)]
*  hospitals or providers who are engaging in bad behavior, we should hold them accountable. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=349.94s)]
*  That's an integrity measure, not a benefit cut, and I would be hopeful that whether it's [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=355.94s)]
*  Medicare or Medicaid or anything else, we would look for waste, fraud, and abuse, root [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=360.94s)]
*  it out, and end it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=365.94s)]
*  Dusty Johnson, always a pleasure sir, thank you. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=367.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx2e-P_g8s&t=369.94s)]
