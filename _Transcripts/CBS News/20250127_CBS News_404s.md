# Homan in Chicago as immigration raids occur, Trump's deportation plans take shape
**CBS News:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo)
*  Welcome back. President Trump's immigration crackdown is taking shape across the country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=0.0s)]
*  Federal officials ramped up arrests over the weekend and they say more are on the way. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=6.0s)]
*  And Chicago is just one of the cities that's been the target of recent immigration arrests. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=11.0s)]
*  And Trump's new border saw was there to oversee the operation. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=17.0s)]
*  CBS News Chicago's Asahar Azai reports from the Windy City. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=22.0s)]
*  We're expecting federal agents to continue making arrests in the city over the next couple of days. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=27.0s)]
*  We know right now their mission is to detain any undocumented people that have active warrants. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=32.0s)]
*  They began those arrests yesterday and those will continue. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=38.0s)]
*  Here's a look at President Donald Trump's new borders are. Tom Homan on the ground in Chicago. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=42.0s)]
*  We know the targeted arrests began before dawn Sunday and went on into the late morning. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=47.0s)]
*  The arrest of President Trump seems to be a collective federal effort. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=52.0s)]
*  Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents joined by the DEA, FBI, ATF, Border Patrol and U.S. Marshals. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=56.0s)]
*  Right now it's unclear how many people they arrested in Chicago, who those people are and what crimes they're accused of. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=62.0s)]
*  Chicago police tell us though they did not assist. That's in accordance with local law. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=69.0s)]
*  Here's what Homan said about the latest crackdown followed by 22nd Ward Alderman Michael Rodriguez. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=74.0s)]
*  The numbers steadily increased and the number of arrests nationwide as we open up the aperture. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=80.0s)]
*  The fact is that these fearful raids, these sinister raids are unjust and they're causing mayhem in our communities. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=84.0s)]
*  Governor J.B. Pritzker speaking out to the confusion local leaders are facing from the feds, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=91.0s)]
*  saying he supports the deportation of undocumented people that are convicted of violent crimes. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=98.0s)]
*  Mayor Brandon Johnson highlighting that it's imperative Chicagoans know their constitutional rights. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=104.0s)]
*  We've reached out to ICE this morning to see if they've made any arrests on this Monday. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=110.0s)]
*  So far we have not heard back. Reporting in Chicago, I'm Asal Rezai, CBS News. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=115.0s)]
*  We're going to move on to Capitol Hill now where senators will vote on if to confirm President Trump's Attorney General pick, Pam Bondi, on Wednesday. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=121.0s)]
*  On Thursday, they'll hold hearings for FBI Director Pick Cash Patel. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=130.0s)]
*  In the meantime, the Department of Justice is undergoing a lot of policy changes. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=134.0s)]
*  CBS News Department of Justice reporter Jake Rosen joins us live with the latest. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=138.0s)]
*  Jake, thank you for being with us today. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=143.0s)]
*  Both the DOJ and the DHS are seeing huge policy shifts, especially when it comes to immigration and deportation. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=145.0s)]
*  So what's new with how the agencies are operating? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=152.0s)]
*  So in a memo sent out last week by interim Deputy Director of the Department of Justice, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=157.0s)]
*  Emil Boeve, who was an attorney for Donald Trump back in that New York court case early last year, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=163.0s)]
*  he set out strict guidelines for how the Department of Justice should move forward in terms of these deportations and targeted arrests as they're being called going forward into the next couple of weeks. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=168.0s)]
*  The big thing, as we know that Donald Trump has said out loud, would be mobilizing resources from across the government to, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=179.0s)]
*  while these government agencies have to stay in their lanes, assist in what they're doing. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=185.0s)]
*  And another thing that the Department of Justice is looking at is moving around resources, especially in terms of career attorneys, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=189.0s)]
*  people who are not political appointees, to basically take on states and localities that claim that they are sanctuary cities, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=195.0s)]
*  which would mean, like this reporter in Chicago just pointed out, that the local officials and local police are not going to play a role in assisting with these arrests. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=201.0s)]
*  The Trump administration has long made a point of and Trump campaign made a long point of on the campaign trail to really stay focused on attacking these cities [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=209.0s)]
*  and finding ways to coerce them into basically giving into federal pressure on things like deportations. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=216.0s)]
*  So as all of this is happening, we know as of right now the DOJ is operating without an attorney general or even an FBI director. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=221.0s)]
*  So what is the likelihood that these Trump picks will get confirmed? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=230.0s)]
*  Well, in terms of Pam Bondi, who is very likely to be the next attorney general of the United States, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=235.0s)]
*  she was the attorney general back in Florida and a longtime supporter of Donald Trump going back to 2015 and 2016. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=240.0s)]
*  She is very likely to be confirmed. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=246.0s)]
*  And while the hearing that she had a couple of weeks ago on Capitol Hill was a little contentious among Democrats, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=248.0s)]
*  among Republicans there is basically an anonymous agreement of what role she should be, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=254.0s)]
*  especially coming out of that Matt Gaetz appointment and kind of collapse of his pick as attorney general back in November and December. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=259.0s)]
*  Now, in terms of Cash Patel, things are a little bit different. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=266.0s)]
*  That process has been slowed down. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=269.0s)]
*  There are a lot of skeptics within the Senate Judiciary Committee around Cash Patel and how his nomination should proceed. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=271.0s)]
*  He's, again, another longtime ally of Donald Trump, but with more extreme views on things like what we saw last week with the mass pardons of January 6 rioters. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=277.0s)]
*  That's something that he has long called for in addition to potentially going after Democrats should he get put in place at the FBI. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=286.0s)]
*  He's been a longtime critic of Democrat politicians, Democrat members of the Department of Justice. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=292.0s)]
*  In addition to general bureaucrats that he claims basically have have rigged their systems against Donald Trump before Donald Trump took office last week. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=298.0s)]
*  All right, Jake. So as you said there, we know Pam Bondi likely to get confirmed. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=305.0s)]
*  But in the meantime, the DOJ handling a lot of new policy changes. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=310.0s)]
*  So how are they doing that given the vacuum in leadership as we wait for these confirmation hearings to take place? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=314.0s)]
*  Well, there are temporary appointees in place who are doing Donald Trump's bidding already. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=321.0s)]
*  And while Pam Bondi is expected to take over potentially at some point this week, we'll have to see how that plays out specifically. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=326.0s)]
*  But there are already things underway. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=332.0s)]
*  Some of those things are, again, like what we just talked about with basically getting the ball moving on how the federal government is going to be involved in these mass deportation and targeted arrest efforts of. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=334.0s)]
*  Legal migrants who have criminal records. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=343.0s)]
*  Part of that, too, is slowing down and stopping further cases in terms of civil rights cases that the government involves himself in. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=345.0s)]
*  Slowing down police reform efforts and undoing what President Biden laid out to do in terms of executive orders on how the Department of Justice should proceed in terms of police reform across the country. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=352.0s)]
*  And another thing in terms of when we talk about these arrests and what the future of law enforcement is in America, the Trump administration in that memo pointed out that they want prosecutors to now look at the. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=362.0s)]
*  Maximum possible penalties when it comes to going after people like these legal migrants in the country and who are being targeted and to not give prosecutors a leeway that the Biden administration Biden White House gave these prosecutors to maybe go lighter on someone who maybe is an active member of their community and doing good things versus a criminal. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=372.0s)]
*  The Trump administration is saying right now they need to fully stick to the strictest guidelines that they can in terms of sentencing. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=390.0s)]
*  OK, CBS News Department of Justice reporter Jake Rosen. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=396.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=399.0s)]
*  For your time today. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp3yuApyXo&t=400.0s)]
