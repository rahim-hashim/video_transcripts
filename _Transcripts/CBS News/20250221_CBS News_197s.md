# Details on judge's allowance of government layoffs
**CBS News:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI)
*  A federal judge has refused to stop President Trump's mass [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=0.0s)]
*  firings, saying unions representing those workers [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  have to take their claims to Federal Labor Relations [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=6.28s)]
*  Authority. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=9.32s)]
*  This is the latest victory for the president and Elon Musk, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=10.24s)]
*  as the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency looks [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=13.36s)]
*  to slash federal spending. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=16.28s)]
*  CBS News senior White House correspondent Weijia Zhang [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  joins us now from outside the White House with more on this. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=20.8s)]
*  Weijia, what is the White House reaction to the judge's ruling? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=23.84s)]
*  And I wonder if President Trump may expand his efforts [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=27.12s)]
*  as a result. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=30.96s)]
*  Well, Errol, so far the White House has not reacted, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=33.36s)]
*  but certainly will perceive this as a win. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  But it's important to point out that the judge in this case [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=39.06s)]
*  did not rule on the legality of what [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=42.08s)]
*  the administration is doing. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  He simply said that the way this was filed [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=45.92s)]
*  was in bounds outside of his jurisdiction. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  So they said that the labor groups would [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=52.44s)]
*  have to refile in a different way. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=54.6s)]
*  So as you can imagine, Errol, there [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=57.72s)]
*  are several other lawsuits in the works, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=60.4s)]
*  including class action lawsuits, trying [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=63.04s)]
*  to stop these mass firings, claiming [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=66.12s)]
*  that they are not constitutional, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  that the administration is acting beyond its power. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=71.32s)]
*  But like I said, because the judge essentially [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=74.44s)]
*  did not stop what they are doing, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=77.92s)]
*  they will likely tout this as a victory, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=80.76s)]
*  at least for now. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=84.28s)]
*  But it's important to note that we [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=85.52s)]
*  don't know what's going to happen when [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=87.24s)]
*  it comes to all the other lawsuits that are in the works. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  Looking forward, Weijia, the president's expected to give [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=93.2s)]
*  remarks at CPAC tomorrow, Saturday. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  His first appearance at this conference [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=97.8s)]
*  was as a surprise guest way back in 2011. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=99.76s)]
*  How key has this group been to his political ascent [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=102.94s)]
*  since then? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=106.48s)]
*  Well, Errol, I can tell you that in some circles, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=108.68s)]
*  it's actually called TPAC, Trump Political Action Group. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=111.3s)]
*  That says everything. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=115.97999999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=117.36s)]
*  I mean, this has become a gathering of his base, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=118.02s)]
*  of his most loyal supporters, and really has given him [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=123.58s)]
*  a microphone to share his views and to promote [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=126.82s)]
*  his political brand. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=132.18s)]
*  And that ultimately helped him win in 2016. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=133.46s)]
*  And so this is a big conference for the president [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=138.42s)]
*  and we expect that he's going to make a splash. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=141.14s)]
*  I'm sure you've been talking about this morning, Errol. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=144.26s)]
*  His ally, Elon Musk, was there yesterday [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=146.77999999999997s)]
*  and he brandished a chainsaw to make the point [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=150.14s)]
*  that they are slashing through bureaucracy, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=153.33999999999997s)]
*  that they are making cuts galore. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=155.61999999999998s)]
*  And I imagine we will hear much of that from President Trump, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=158.1s)]
*  too. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=161.06s)]
*  Last year, he said that it was going [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=161.56s)]
*  to be Judgment Day on election day for all the fraudsters, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=163.89999999999998s)]
*  for all the people in the government who he claimed [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=168.29999999999998s)]
*  were not doing what they ought to be. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=172.94s)]
*  And he said he was a political dissident. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=175.34s)]
*  And that was a year ago, of course, when he was a candidate. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=178.73999999999998s)]
*  So I think this time will also be a sort of opportunity [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=181.57999999999998s)]
*  for him to pump his fist in the air and say, here we are. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=185.38s)]
*  I'm president. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=190.1s)]
*  All right, we will cover it all. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=191.34s)]
*  Weijia, great to see you. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=192.62s)]
*  Thanks so much for your reporting. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=193.85999999999999s)]
*  You too, Errol. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=195.38s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0n6fazTzKI&t=195.98s)]
