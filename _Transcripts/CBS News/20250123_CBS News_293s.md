# Details on new Los Angeles-area fires
**CBS News:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI)
*  All right, here we go again. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=0.0s)]
*  California firefighters are up against yet another wildfire in addition to the cluster [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=2.6s)]
*  of fires already burning in and around Los Angeles. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=6.88s)]
*  The Subobita fire erupted in Sherman Oaks overnight and crews are battling the Hughes [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  fire which was sparked yesterday. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=14.44s)]
*  That's in addition to the deadly Palisades and Eaton wildfires that have been burning [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=16.6s)]
*  for more than two weeks. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=20.2s)]
*  The fast moving flames prompted evacuation warnings in the area. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=21.44s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=24.8s)]
*  I said, okay, let me get up. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=25.96s)]
*  So I got up and went to the backyard and I could see already like the red flames on the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=27.12s)]
*  other side of the hill. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=32.32s)]
*  So it was very scary. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=33.32s)]
*  I woke up everybody and we just started gathering stuff. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=34.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's, I don't understand what's happening. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=38.2s)]
*  We can't, we can't get a break. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=40.88s)]
*  CBS News reporter Andreas Gutierrez is live from Santa Clarita at a command center just [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=43.88s)]
*  north of LA. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  Andreas, firefighters are telling you that they were able to get ahead of the Subobita [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  fire overnight. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=54.36s)]
*  How are they able to do that and what's the progress so far this morning? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=56.12s)]
*  Well they have made an aggressive firefighting effort from on the ground and in the air and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=61.16s)]
*  it's burned 40 acres thus far but it quickly grew from 10 acres overnight. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=65.8s)]
*  It broke out there near the Getty Center and the 405. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=70.72s)]
*  25 mile per hour winds helped drive that fire and the Santa Ana winds. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=74.12s)]
*  It's why we are still in a red flag warning through tomorrow morning. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=79.0s)]
*  At this point they were able to get 250 firefighters from the Los Angeles Fire Department to put [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  out the flames on the ground. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=89.72s)]
*  Yes, the Bel Air and Brentwood neighborhoods were under evacuation orders but three hours [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=91.56s)]
*  after that fire broke out they were able to lift those evacuation warnings because they [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  were able to stop the forward progress of that fire. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  So right now they have a very good handle on that fire. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=104.92s)]
*  All right, let me ask you about first responders that are also fighting these other flames. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=108.4s)]
*  Are there enough resources to go around for the response? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=112.52s)]
*  In other words you got the Eden Fire, Palisades and now these. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=114.96s)]
*  Yeah, for these fires that broke out, the Hughes Fire, the Sepulveda Fire, absolutely. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=120.0s)]
*  Here in the Hughes Fire where we're at just 50 miles north of Los Angeles there are about [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=124.92s)]
*  4,000 firefighters right now that are trying to contain this fire from growing. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=129.4s)]
*  Thus far here more than 10,000 acres have burned but luckily no structures have been [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=135.88s)]
*  damaged which is surprising given the scale of this fire. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=141.88000000000002s)]
*  And a lot of this has to do with the fact that a lot of these firefighters were pre-stage. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=146.68s)]
*  They were positioned to be ready on the standby in case fires broke out. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  So yesterday it broke out as a small brush fire up here in the Casseac Lake area, 50 acres. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  And then within two hours it grew to 50 to 5,000 acres but they were able quickly to move in all [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=165.64s)]
*  these firefighters that were on standby both in the area and on the ground and they were able to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=174.11999999999998s)]
*  start getting a good fire line going around this. And as you said there's also the resources that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=179.55999999999997s)]
*  came from out of state and in some cases from out of the country from Mexico and Canada that are still [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=186.44s)]
*  here and providing mutual aid to the California firefighters and so they were able to mobilize [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=192.04s)]
*  resources and so besides the winds not being so strong yesterday they were also able to deploy [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=198.68s)]
*  these firefighters pretty quickly to get ahead of these fires. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  All right, Andreas Gutierrez for us this morning. Andreas, thank you very much. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=209.88s)]
*  Let us bring in CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Grant Gilmore with the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=214.6s)]
*  first look at the national forecast. Hey Grant. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=217.48s)]
*  Hey Vlad, yeah keeping a close eye on those conditions over Southern California today. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=219.48s)]
*  Still gusty but maybe not as bad as they were yesterday even though they weren't as bad as [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=222.92s)]
*  expected. Still looking at the potential for some wind gusts today between 70 to 80 miles per hour. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=227.56s)]
*  There's relative humidity readings between 5 to 15 percent so the combination between those things [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=232.04s)]
*  and the ongoing fires and just the the continually dry conditions across Southern California. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=236.92s)]
*  Critical fire danger across the area today. Let me show you the the forecast wind gusts as we go [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=241.72s)]
*  through our Thursday 50 to 60 mile per hour gusts up towards Santa Clarita somewhere in the higher [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=246.92s)]
*  elevations we could see those gusts approaching 70 to maybe even 75 miles per hour but you see [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=251.23999999999998s)]
*  through tomorrow afternoon those wind speeds will begin to die down. Not only are we looking at a [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=256.76s)]
*  reduction in those wind speeds but an increased chance of not just moisture but how about some [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=261.96s)]
*  rain over Southern California. We need it for sure. Look at this forecast as we go through the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=266.76s)]
*  weekend showers moving into Southern California hanging around for a couple of days. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=271.4s)]
*  Now some places could get some locally heavy rainfall and that may amount into some rainfall [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=277.16s)]
*  totals there around a half inch to an inch of rain that may result in some landslides something [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=281.8s)]
*  that we'll have to watch really closely through the weekend into early next week. Flat back to you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=286.6s)]
*  All right Grant thank you. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07d9YGYVbI&t=291.48s)]
