# Netanyahu calls for hostage release by Saturday with Gaza ceasefire on shaky ground
**CBS News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c)
*  Now to a major development in the Middle East where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=0.0s)]
*  is now using similar language to President Trump calling for Hamas to release more hostages by Saturday [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=5.24s)]
*  or the ceasefire is off. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=10.96s)]
*  Yesterday the president hosted the King of Jordan at the White House. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=12.72s)]
*  Trump needs regional support to carry out his plan for the U.S. to take ownership of Gaza [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=16.84s)]
*  and remove millions of Palestinians. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=22.04s)]
*  Chris Livesey has more from Israel. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  With the Gaza ceasefire more brittle than ever, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=27.12s)]
*  Your plan for the Palestinian people? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=31.0s)]
*  President Trump, in a meeting with King Abdullah of Jordan, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=32.76s)]
*  doubled down on his plans to resettle the Palestinians and transform the land. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=36.04s)]
*  There is nothing to buy. It's Gaza. It's a war-torn area. We're going to take it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=41.76s)]
*  We're going to hold it. We're going to cherish it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=47.28s)]
*  But for now, among the rubble live two million people, including 76 hostages. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=50.0s)]
*  Under a peace deal, the terrorist organization Hamas was supposed to release three more of them on Saturday, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=56.76s)]
*  like the three released last weekend. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=62.92s)]
*  But no longer, Hamas announced Monday, alleging Israel delayed allowing Palestinians to return to northern Gaza [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=65.56s)]
*  and more aid under the deal. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated calls to release the hostages by Saturday, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=76.08s)]
*  or war will resume. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=81.92s)]
*  Donald Trump says that Gaza will become hell, says Joma Abukos. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=84.0s)]
*  Worse than the hell we already have? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  Somewhere beneath those ruins is Nimrod Cohen, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=92.4s)]
*  a 24-year-old soldier taken hostage when Hamas attacked his tank. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  But his mother told us one of the hostages who came out last weekend confirmed he's alive. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=100.8s)]
*  You cannot imagine how excited we were to hear something from someone who was with Nimrod. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=107.28s)]
*  Nimrod told him about his family, his twin sister and his brother, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=116.2s)]
*  and that he liked to travel and that he likes to sing. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=122.36s)]
*  I'm hearing jets fly by. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=130.24s)]
*  Do you worry that war is going to start again? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=132.32000000000002s)]
*  I'm afraid. I'm scared for Nimrod. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  President Trump has suggested the people of Gaza be resettled in neighboring countries like Jordan. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=141.0s)]
*  Hours after King Abdullah sat with Trump, he rebuffed that idea on social media, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=146.68s)]
*  reiterating that Jordan was against the displacement of Palestinians. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=151.44s)]
*  But he said he's open to caring for 2,000 sick children from Gaza. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=155.24s)]
*  Gail? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=160.60000000000002s)]
*  All right, Chris Livese, reporting from Tel Aviv. Thank you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gkteBV31c&t=161.52s)]
