# Elon Musk says Trump agreed to "shut down" USAID, government's primary humanitarian aid agency
**CBS News:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU)
*  CBS News has learned at least two top security officials at the US Agency for International [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=0.0s)]
*  Development, also known as USAID, they've been placed on administrative leave. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=5.92s)]
*  This move came after the two officials refused to allow personnel from the Elon Musk-run [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  quote, Department of Government Efficiency to access classified materials. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=16.68s)]
*  In a conversation on X overnight, that's his private social media platform, Musk said he [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=22.04s)]
*  spoke with President Trump about the future of USAID and that Trump approves of this move. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=27.1s)]
*  CBS News White House reporter Olivia Rinaldi joins me now to talk about what all of this [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=34.34s)]
*  means. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=38.660000000000004s)]
*  Olivia, what more do we know about the access Doge was trying to get? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=39.660000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, good morning to you, Errol. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=45.260000000000005s)]
*  We're here outside the USAID headquarters in Washington, D.C. where staffers were told [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=48.22s)]
*  late last night not to come into the agency today and await further instruction. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=52.9s)]
*  Now this comes after a flurry of activity this weekend. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=58.26s)]
*  As you mentioned, those two top security officials, the director for security and the deputy director [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=61.54s)]
*  for security at USAID, were placed on administrative leave on Saturday night after reports that [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=66.22s)]
*  Elon Musk and members of Doge were trying to access classified material at USAID. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=72.18s)]
*  Katie Miller, the spokesperson for USAID, said that no classified material was accessed [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=78.46s)]
*  and the White House is denying that report. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=83.25999999999999s)]
*  But we also know that staffers were locked out of their emails over the weekend for USAID. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=85.53999999999999s)]
*  And this comes, as Trump says, he's looking to perhaps overhaul the entire agency. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=91.58s)]
*  Last night upon landing at Joint Base Andrews, Trump called USAID a bunch of lunatics and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=97.13999999999999s)]
*  said he'll be looking at the issue very closely. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=103.3s)]
*  So we're watching here today to see what really unfolds, whether or not there will [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=106.34s)]
*  be any action at all, what happens to these staffers that are in charge really with foreign [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=110.14s)]
*  assistance for countries all over the globe, billions of dollars of foreign assistance [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=114.94s)]
*  that come from the U.S. to other countries. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=120.78s)]
*  And it's often described as soft power by providing aid to other needy people around [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=123.58000000000001s)]
*  the world. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  It helps the U.S. image and goodwill. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=129.42000000000002s)]
*  Trump says it's wasteful, it's an independent organization, but he is open to folding it [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=133.3s)]
*  into the State Department. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=138.22s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=139.98000000000002s)]
*  How would that be different? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=140.98000000000002s)]
*  Well, there are parts of USAID that already report to the State Department and a lot of [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=141.98000000000002s)]
*  their funds are appropriated by Congress. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=147.86s)]
*  But it's something that Elon Musk has had his sights on. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=150.58s)]
*  In recent days over the weekend, even, he called USAID a criminal organization and said [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=153.70000000000002s)]
*  that it needs to die. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=158.74s)]
*  We heard him last night on his platform X saying that he got Trump's blessing in getting [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=161.24s)]
*  rid of USAID. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=166.76000000000002s)]
*  So a lot of questions about what's going on behind the scenes in any executive action [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  that Trump could take to either overhaul the agency or get rid of it altogether. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=172.04000000000002s)]
*  A lot of questions around that today, Errol. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=177.36s)]
*  All right, Olivia Rinaldi, outside USAID HQ. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=179.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpESUa3bPU&t=182.62s)]
