# Latest news on Pope Francis' health as more details emerge about his hospital stay
**CBS News:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ)
*  Alright folks, it's been two weeks since Pope Francis was admitted to the hospital this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=0.0s)]
*  morning. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=3.72s)]
*  The Vatican reported another restful night for the 88-year-old Pontiff and a further [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=4.72s)]
*  slight improvement as he continues to undergo a variety of treatments. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=8.02s)]
*  CBS News Senior Foreign Correspondent Seth Doane is joining me right now live outside [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  of the Vatican with an update. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=16.04s)]
*  So Seth, what are you hearing about his condition today? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=18.6s)]
*  Well, Vlad, we hear from Vatican sources that the Pope was able to sit up in his chair, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=22.0s)]
*  that he's in good humor, but we also still know that he is in critical condition. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=27.64s)]
*  He needs this high flow oxygen that we know he's been getting on and off and the prognosis [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=32.28s)]
*  is still guarded, which means doctors won't say whether they believe it will go one way [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=37.24s)]
*  or another. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=42.22s)]
*  We got a few other details last night. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=43.22s)]
*  That CAT scan that he'd had earlier in the week was showing a normal evolution of a pulmonary [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=45.24s)]
*  issue like the Pope is facing. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=50.0s)]
*  We also heard that that kidney failure, mild early kidney failure, was not concerning doctors. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=52.92s)]
*  So some good news, some bad news, a little bit of what we've heard, but generally encouraging, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=60.04s)]
*  but doctors still keeping him in critical condition and without a prognosis. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=66.8s)]
*  So the Vatican has always shared detailed information about the health of this Pope, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=72.6s)]
*  but it's not common, Seth. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=78.16s)]
*  Yes, and I don't need to tell you, you are a student of history, Vlad. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=82.56s)]
*  You probably know better than anyone, but this is more information than we've seen [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=86.52s)]
*  in the past for sure. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  When you look back to when Pope John Paul II died, he had in his last days, the Vatican [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  never talked about him having Parkinson's. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=99.64s)]
*  If you look back even further, there was Pope Paul VI who died in 1978. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=102.12s)]
*  Just a few days before he died, the Vatican said simply he was taking a few days' rest. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=107.96s)]
*  And then there was another Pope right after him. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=112.8s)]
*  It was only Pope for 33 days, Pope John Paul I, and he had had severe blood circulation [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=114.88s)]
*  issues and the Cardinals who had just elected him knew nothing about that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=121.64s)]
*  So really depending on the Pope, depending on the condition, depending on the administration, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  we know more or less. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=131.16s)]
*  But for as little as we feel like we're getting each day, this is surprisingly a lot of information [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  Vatican watchers tell us, Vlad. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=137.72s)]
*  All right, Seth Doan reporting for us from outside the Vatican this morning. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=140.2s)]
*  Thanks, Seth. Appreciate it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS2-XGUs1fQ&t=143.6s)]
