# What to know about Trump's trip to North Carolina and California, court battle over birthright
**CBS News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0)
*  Happening now, President Trump is traveling to North Carolina, where he will be briefed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=0.0s)]
*  on recovery after Hurricane Helene and survey some of the damage. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=4.2s)]
*  The president will then head to wildfire ravage Los Angeles. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=7.96s)]
*  As he left the White House, he spoke to reporters about the trip. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=11.28s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=13.64s)]
*  I think the North Carolina has been a horrible thing, the way that's been allowed to fester, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=14.64s)]
*  and we're going to get it fixed up. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=19.64s)]
*  It should have been done months ago from the hurricane that took place almost four months [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=21.64s)]
*  ago. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=26.36s)]
*  North Carolina's been treated very badly, so we're stopping there and we're going to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=28.24s)]
*  then go to Los Angeles and take a look at a fire that could have been put out if they [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=32.24s)]
*  let the water flow, but they didn't let the water flow. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=37.4s)]
*  CBS News senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe is live now from [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=40.96s)]
*  the White House, where Air Force One lifted off moments ago from Washington. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=44.44s)]
*  So Ed, as you know, the Biden administration's response to North Carolina and the hurricane [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  relief effort has been a sticking point for Trump throughout his campaign. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=53.74s)]
*  So talk about what he is promising to North Carolina today and how fast, because he seems [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=57.86s)]
*  to be indicating that building up an entire town should have been done in just four months. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=64.22s)]
*  What's he promising to the residents there? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=68.42s)]
*  Well, he's reacting to the concerns of his supporters and people in rural North Carolina, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=70.9s)]
*  that part of the state that was affected by the hurricane, that perhaps FEMA aid didn't [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=75.74000000000001s)]
*  come as quickly as it could have. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=80.62s)]
*  You can go back and review exactly how quick the federal and state response got to that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=82.46s)]
*  part of the state, which was slammed by this storm in unexpected ways, and it is going [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=86.58s)]
*  to take some time to rebuild the general western North Carolina Asheville region. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=91.74s)]
*  And so by him going today, he's going to reiterate continued federal support. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=96.5s)]
*  Remember, he said this week that he thinks going forward perhaps states should cover [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=99.38s)]
*  their own expenses after disasters. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=103.53999999999999s)]
*  I suspect governors and lawmakers from states that have been hit by this stuff, including [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=105.97999999999999s)]
*  the Speaker of the House, for example, comes from Louisiana, it's at its fair of natural [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=110.3s)]
*  disasters, might think differently about that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=114.34s)]
*  We'll see how that goes. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=117.06s)]
*  Then he goes off to California to see the wildfires, where you heard him there say, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=118.06s)]
*  if only they let the water come from Northern California down to Southern California. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=121.58s)]
*  No, that's not quite how it works. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=124.86s)]
*  But he's been concerned about some environmental regulations that were put in place regarding [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=127.06s)]
*  distribution of water across that massive state and the entire west and how it ran into [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=131.3s)]
*  state environmental concerns. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=136.06s)]
*  It'll probably come up when he runs into California Governor Gavin Newsom later today, who says [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=138.5s)]
*  he will be on the tarmac to greet the president when he arrives. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=142.58s)]
*  And we should also point out he will meet also with the Democratic governor of North [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=145.70000000000002s)]
*  Carolina, who just won in November as President Trump won the Tar Heel State, and the White [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=149.02s)]
*  House tells us and the senators confirm that they invited senators Alex Padilla and Adam [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=153.38s)]
*  Schiff, two big Democratic critics of the president, to fly with them on Air Force One [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=158.10000000000002s)]
*  to see things out in California. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=161.98000000000002s)]
*  They cannot go because of big votes tonight on the Pete Hegseth confirmation in the Senate, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=163.34s)]
*  but both signaled they appreciated the invite, Vlad. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=168.38s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=170.86s)]
*  Let's switch gears, Ed, and talk about that court battle brewing over the president's [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=171.9s)]
*  attempt to end birthright citizenship. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=175.66s)]
*  He is responding to a federal judge's block that was issued yesterday on the executive [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=178.86s)]
*  order. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=184.54s)]
*  And I don't know if you had a chance, I know you're really busy, Ed, but on CBS Mornings [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=185.54s)]
*  Plus, the attorney general for the state of New Jersey helped break down to Tony and Adriana [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=187.9s)]
*  what the 14th Amendment to the Constitution means and how it's been interpreted over the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=192.26s)]
*  course of our republic. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=197.9s)]
*  But how is the president reacting to that judge blocking the decision? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=199.54s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=203.62s)]
*  This is a Reagan-appointed federal judge in Seattle who said that what the president's [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=204.62s)]
*  trying to do is unconstitutional. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=208.1s)]
*  And the president reacted this way in the Oval Office yesterday afternoon. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=213.66s)]
*  Obviously, it will appeal if they put it before a certain judge in Seattle, I guess, right? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=214.66s)]
*  And there's no surprises with that judge. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=223.66s)]
*  No surprises, he says. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=227.9s)]
*  But again, it was a Reagan-appointed federal judge out in the Pacific Northwest. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=233.46s)]
*  That one will start working its way through the courts, the New Jersey attorney general [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=238.42000000000002s)]
*  and others across the country suing the Trump administration now saying, you can't do this. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=241.14000000000001s)]
*  The president knew exactly what he was doing once he signed the executive order because [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=245.62s)]
*  he and other conservative activists and administration officials have been suggesting for years that [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=249.0s)]
*  one way to potentially slow illegal immigration into the United States is to take away what [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=255.3s)]
*  is seen by many, they believe, to be the big carrot. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=260.74s)]
*  That if you can get here and you can have children here, they'd be U.S. citizens and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=263.90000000000003s)]
*  you'd be able to find a way to stay. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=266.66s)]
*  Remember, though, birthright citizenship enshrined in the Constitution goes back to the founding [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=268.34000000000003s)]
*  of the country. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=272.68s)]
*  It's not a chicken and egg thing. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=274.54s)]
*  It's been there for a while. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=275.86s)]
*  It's just conservatives believe, at least some of them, that if you remove that, maybe [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=276.86s)]
*  the flow will end. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=280.52s)]
*  One other thing to point out this morning, Vlad, from here at the White House, the press [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=282.3s)]
*  secretary tweeted out a photo a little while ago of a military aircraft being loaded up [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=285.58s)]
*  with people who were being deported from the United States. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=290.1s)]
*  The CBS News confirmed team confirms, as they're supposed to, that this was a photo taken of [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=293.26s)]
*  Fort Bliss, Texas. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=300.38s)]
*  Our Ellie Watson over at the Pentagon has confirmed that two C-17 military flights flew [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=302.62s)]
*  overnight or early this morning into Guatemala, and just a little while ago, the Guatemalan [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=307.66s)]
*  authorities confirmed that one flight with 79 people on board came back. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=311.3s)]
*  What we don't know yet, what we're working to figure out, is was this one of those regularly [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=315.06s)]
*  scheduled deportation flights that the U.S. has been conducting for years during the first [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=319.62s)]
*  Trump administration and during the Biden administration, where they go back two, three, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=325.06s)]
*  four times a week to places like Guatemala, El Salvador, and other countries across Latin [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=329.38s)]
*  America and where advance notice is given. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=333.58s)]
*  What we don't know is where these immigrants rounded up and prepared for deportation during [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=336.16s)]
*  the final days of the Biden administration and today just happened to be the day they [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  were going, or was this something that happened since Monday? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=345.04s)]
*  We'll work to figure that out. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=348.36s)]
*  Normally these flights are usually conducted on sort of commercial airline style jets that [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=350.04s)]
*  are usually contracted out by the government and fly from places like Texas, the San Diego [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=355.40000000000003s)]
*  area in Louisiana, back to Central and South America. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=359.92s)]
*  The difference here, as you can see in the photo, is they're using a C-17 this time. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=363.34s)]
*  It's a different kind of aircraft, but doing the exact same kind of work that's been done [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=367.85999999999996s)]
*  for several years, sending people back. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=371.34s)]
*  And we should point out, illegal border crossings are pretty low right now. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=373.53999999999996s)]
*  There's been no surge since the election. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=379.12s)]
*  And so what exactly these troops that are being sent to the border are preparing for [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=381.29999999999995s)]
*  is unclear given that the numbers crossing are not that high. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=384.82s)]
*  Vlad? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=388.09999999999997s)]
*  I have a similar point that you make, Ed. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=389.1s)]
*  And one wonders, had the Biden administration during its time with these regular deportations [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=390.46000000000004s)]
*  that happened, as you point out, on a consistent basis, had they, every time they happened, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=395.46000000000004s)]
*  tweeted out a photo or blared it from the press briefing room that perhaps that might [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=400.70000000000005s)]
*  have changed people's perceptions of immigration under the Biden-Harris administration? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=406.74s)]
*  Because from what I can tell, and you guys will fact check me on this, but the reporting [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=411.38s)]
*  seems to be that the number of people being deported every day, which is typically a couple [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=414.48s)]
*  of hundred, has not really gone up all that much, except that we're just hearing more [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=419.06s)]
*  about it from the president and his press people. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=422.58000000000004s)]
*  And that's what this whole week has been about, Vlad, demonstrating action, that things are [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=426.22s)]
*  changing, that things are happening to make it look or to actually change the way things [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=429.86s)]
*  were done over the last four years. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=435.1s)]
*  And again, so far in this situation, it doesn't look to be any different than the flights [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=436.74s)]
*  that have been ongoing in the past. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=440.86s)]
*  The difference is the kind of aircraft used. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZK6WX9wKn0&t=442.54s)]
