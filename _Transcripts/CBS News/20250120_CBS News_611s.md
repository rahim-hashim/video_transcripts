# Why Biden pardoned Milley, Fauci and family members before Trump took office
**CBS News:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI)
*  And we are seeing things change across Washington this afternoon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=0.0s)]
*  And here's one of them. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=5.0s)]
*  You may have seen this portrait of General Mark Milley. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=6.96s)]
*  It was unveiled just a few weeks ago in the Pentagon. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=9.44s)]
*  And notably, there is a, well, that now what we're showing you is where that portrait has [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  been taken down from the Pentagon. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=19.48s)]
*  As Donald Trump came to power, we're told that the portrait of the former chairman of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=21.88s)]
*  the Joint Chiefs of Staff was removed. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=26.48s)]
*  And they were closed. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=30.68s)]
*  Highly unusual for a man who served 40 years in the U.S. military. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=31.68s)]
*  But General Milley got on the wrong side of Donald Trump. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=35.36s)]
*  And as a result, President Biden issued a pardon for Milley today to warn against any [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  future protection. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=46.44s)]
*  And, Morgan, I know you've spoken with the general. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=47.44s)]
*  I've interviewed him for 60 minutes and spoken with him recently as well. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  He was very worried about his own personal safety and worried about retribution. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=53.64s)]
*  Well, it's interesting because he served very closely with Donald Trump as his main [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=58.2s)]
*  military adviser when he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=63.9s)]
*  This isn't a relationship at a distance that went bad. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  He was someone who felt when he took that walk back in 2020 to St. John's and stood [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=70.64s)]
*  in the midst of those Black Lives Matter protesters that he had been pulled into something in [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=77.08s)]
*  terms of appearing to represent in uniform someone backing what Donald Trump was saying [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=82.76s)]
*  in that moment in time and wanted to make clear that he wasn't trying to cross that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=88.44s)]
*  line of bringing the military into politics, something that he very clearly spoke out about [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  after the fact. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=98.28s)]
*  And since that time, really became very clearly someone who was about lawful orders, obeying [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  only lawful orders, making clear that the president is not the emperor or the king. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=108.0s)]
*  The president is constrained by design by our founding fathers in the role that he has. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=113.28s)]
*  And Nora, it's not just our speculation that this was removed intentionally. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=121.64s)]
*  Katie Miller, who is the wife of Stephen Miller, one of the top advisers to Donald Trump and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=127.88s)]
*  the soon to be director of Homeland Security or adviser to Homeland Security to the president, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=131.8s)]
*  was posting publicly and posted just a few hours ago that this is coming down. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=137.8s)]
*  She called Mark Milley a paper pusher, made all sorts of accusations about him. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=142.08s)]
*  But he served this country in uniform. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=147.28s)]
*  And in fact, there is also a cost to this for his personal safety. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=148.88000000000002s)]
*  He is one of the people on the hit list for the Iranian regime because of the role he [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=155.02s)]
*  played in helping to take out Qasem Soleimani, that Iranian general, which he did in part [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=158.8s)]
*  at Donald Trump's direction. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  I guess, pulling back for a moment, what kind of message do you think this sends within [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=167.04s)]
*  the Pentagon to other uniformed officers who serve the Constitution, not the president, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  of the United States by design? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=179.2s)]
*  You know, Nora, this is something that—and I know you have heard this as well from others, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=181.16s)]
*  particularly who serve in uniform or have served—how much character, how much judgment, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=186.11999999999998s)]
*  how much rules are just instilled within you as virtues when you take on that uniform [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=193.04s)]
*  because good order and discipline are part and parcel of having a well-functioning military. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=199.88s)]
*  So it is really challenging to some of those in uniform to see this idea of loyalty to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  anything other than the Constitution, of putting aside as well the code of military justice. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=213.04s)]
*  That's one of the things that came up in the hearing for Pete Hegseth, for example. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=220.2s)]
*  It's not just because someone's approved that they don't like that you cheated on your last two wives. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=222.84s)]
*  It's if you did that, you'd be prosecuted if you were in uniform. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=226.96s)]
*  There are reasons some of those things are in there and that some of the Democrats, in [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=231.28s)]
*  particular, in that committee, went at Pete Hegseth that way because they were trying [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=235.32000000000002s)]
*  to make that point, including the ranking member of that committee, saying, you know, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=238.72s)]
*  character in this way is something that you are supposed to uphold your troops to, including [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  laws of conduct. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=251.16000000000003s)]
*  How can you elevate people who do not abide by those themselves? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=252.16s)]
*  And Robert Costa, Mark Milley had become this symbol for someone who stood up to Donald [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=255.6s)]
*  Trump as president in many ways, too, but just saying, look, you have to actually sign [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=260.96s)]
*  the orders. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=265.52s)]
*  You can't just go shoot people in the knees, as Mark Esper described in his book, the former [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=266.52s)]
*  Secretary of Defense, to quell a domestic protest, that there are rules and regulations [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=270.64s)]
*  that he, I think, probably spoke back to the president, for lack of a better word, and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=275.28s)]
*  Donald Trump did not like that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=279.44s)]
*  And then has since been forced with a lot of threats, including Steve Bannon saying [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=280.64s)]
*  there should be a military tribunal, that he should be court-martialed, in those words. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=286.91999999999996s)]
*  How has that affected General Milley recently? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=291.64s)]
*  Nora, when you sat down with General Milley for 60 minutes, he had a grave answer to you [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=293.84s)]
*  about his own personal security, that he has taken real steps to secure himself and his [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  family in the wake of the Trump presidency. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=304.64s)]
*  The backstory here is important. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=306.6s)]
*  In the days after January 6, 2021, then-Chairman Milley did three different things. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=308.6s)]
*  One, he called in a mill-to-mill call the leader of the Chinese military and reassured [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=314.36s)]
*  them that the United States was stable. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=319.48s)]
*  He also had a conversation with then-Speaker Pelosi, where they talked about what they [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=321.68s)]
*  believed was President Trump's mental unfitness for office and his conduct at the time. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=325.88s)]
*  And three, he had a private meeting at the Pentagon with key officials saying that if [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=332.4s)]
*  President Trump decides to do anything militarily to make sure that General Milley is read in, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=336.56s)]
*  once these comments, which are these episodes, were reported by Bob Woodward and myself and [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=342.0s)]
*  our book, Peril, Milley came under enormous scrutiny from Republicans. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=347.88s)]
*  And he had to testify ultimately on Capitol Hill about the decisions he took on January [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=353.02s)]
*  And the consequences of those decisions, as he told you on 60 Minutes, continue to hover [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=358.4s)]
*  over his life. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=364.44s)]
*  And that's why I'm told by a source close to President Biden, he had built a relationship [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  with Chairman Milley in his own presidency, and he wanted to make sure that Milley felt [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=369.88s)]
*  protected in this new Trump presidency. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=374.76s)]
*  I want to bring in Jan Crawford, because pardons is a big part of today. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=377.76s)]
*  Because President Biden has issued so many pardons in these final days, not only for [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=384.08s)]
*  General Milley, but also Anthony Fauci, and then just at the last minute, an extraordinary [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=388.36s)]
*  move for just about every member of his family. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=394.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, obviously those are preemptive pardons. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=397.0s)]
*  They haven't been charged with any crimes, much less convicted. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=399.8s)]
*  And those are highly unusual, not unprecedented, of course. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=403.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, we all remember President Ford pardoned former President Nixon. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=407.52s)]
*  He's not yet been charged. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=412.2s)]
*  So there is precedent for it. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=413.96s)]
*  But this is highly irregular. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=416.64s)]
*  I was thinking, I remember there were some Republicans who were urging then President [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=417.92s)]
*  Trump, before he left office, to preemptively pardon members of his own family, and potentially [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=424.2s)]
*  even himself. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=430.52s)]
*  And obviously Trump declined to do that, at least his immediate family. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=432.08s)]
*  He did pardon his... [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=435.76s)]
*  Father-in-law, Charles Kushner. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=437.88s)]
*  But he had been charged and convicted. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=441.32000000000005s)]
*  And he had actually served time. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=444.76000000000005s)]
*  He had actually gone through the legal process. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=445.76000000000005s)]
*  So I mean, I think the messages that sends, and would these people have been prosecuted, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=448.8s)]
*  I think obviously it's hard to imagine. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  And then of course, they could be prosecuted for future crimes. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=457.8s)]
*  But it goes to what you're saying, Nora. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=463.0s)]
*  The numbers of pardons that we have seen from former now President Biden, I mean, we're [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=465.2s)]
*  talking what, 4,000? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=471.4s)]
*  And in his first term, President Trump, as he was leaving office, I think pardoned about [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  200, 238. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=479.68s)]
*  So it's quite a dramatic increase here that Biden has done. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=481.32s)]
*  It's also interesting to me about Dr. Fauci, who now says he has to travel with security. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=485.48s)]
*  He released a statement saying, let me be perfectly clear. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=489.76s)]
*  I've committed no crime. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=493.03999999999996s)]
*  There are no possible grounds for any allegations or threat of a criminal investigation or prosecution. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=494.44s)]
*  But the fact is, the mere articulation of these baseless threats, the potential that [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=499.28s)]
*  they will be acted upon create immeasurable, intolerable distress for me and my family. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=504.08s)]
*  So he says, I acknowledge and appreciate the action that President Biden has taken today [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  on my behalf. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=513.04s)]
*  And of course, taking that action is not going to do anything about the threats. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=514.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=518.04s)]
*  Right? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=519.04s)]
*  So that's an issue, I think, that is not unique to whether we're talking about General [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=520.04s)]
*  Milley, Fauci. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=523.88s)]
*  That is a reality of public service, sadly, whether you're a Republican or a Democrat. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=525.76s)]
*  The threat levels that people are under right now are actual physical threats. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=532.68s)]
*  But does it take away? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=537.48s)]
*  Physical threats that cover the Supreme Court. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=538.48s)]
*  The justices, there are justices on the Supreme Court who at times have to wear bulletproof [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=540.28s)]
*  vests. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=545.82s)]
*  I mean, think about that. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=546.82s)]
*  So you know, that's again, the pardons don't help that. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=548.72s)]
*  Would the preemptive pardons of members of the Biden family, we're not talking about [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=553.76s)]
*  Hunter Biden right now, who has been accused and was convicted. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  But he also pardoned his partners. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=562.08s)]
*  Yes, he did also pardon him. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=564.12s)]
*  But I mean, these preemptive pardons for the other members of the Biden family and for [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=565.12s)]
*  General Milley and for Dr. Fauci. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=568.52s)]
*  Does that preemptive pardon, though, in some ways say to members of Congress who wanted [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=571.34s)]
*  to hold these hearings and investigate, well, probably not worth it? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=575.64s)]
*  Or do they go ahead and have the hearings anyway? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=578.76s)]
*  Well, I think the question is going to be what are you going to see from some of these [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=580.12s)]
*  state attorneys generals? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=583.12s)]
*  That's where I think you're going to see some of the real action. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=584.2800000000001s)]
*  It's obviously a federal. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=586.84s)]
*  You're the president can only pardon federal crimes. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=588.32s)]
*  I mean, we've seen that with with President Trump, right? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=591.76s)]
*  I mean, he couldn't have gotten a pardon for his state conviction, state court convictions. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=594.6s)]
*  So whatever you're talking about with Dr. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=598.88s)]
*  Fauci and being pardoned for any potential federal crimes, there's still a real avenue [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=602.12s)]
*  there for a state attorney general to try to file suit. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoCPhXpoOnI&t=606.96s)]
