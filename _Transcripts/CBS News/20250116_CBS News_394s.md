# Israeli Cabinet to vote on ceasefire with Hamas after delay
**CBS News:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8)
*  There is uncertainty in the Middle East as the world waits to see if a long-awaited ceasefire deal to end the war in Gaza can make it across the finish line. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel's cabinet is set to vote Friday to potentially ratify the deal. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=7.84s)]
*  It was supposed to happen Thursday, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delayed that vote. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=11.24s)]
*  He claimed Hamas walked back key parts of the agreement, which the group denies. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=15.84s)]
*  If approved, the first phase of the deal would go into effect Sunday. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=19.84s)]
*  Hamas would release 33 women and children hostages over the course of six weeks in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=23.28s)]
*  Israel would also allow up to 600 trucks of humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza each day. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=30.16s)]
*  Earlier, Secretary of State Antony Blinken addressed concerns about the deal during his final briefing at the State Department. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  So I am confident and I fully expect that implementation will begin, as we said on Sunday. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=41.96s)]
*  Look, it's not exactly surprising that in a process and a negotiation that has been this challenging and this fraud, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  you may get a loose end. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=57.96s)]
*  We're tying up that loose end as we speak. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=61.96s)]
*  During the briefing, two reporters who have previously criticized the Biden administration's response to the war had to be removed for shouting at Blinken and accusing him of supporting genocide. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  Even with this deal on the horizon, the fighting continues. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=73.44s)]
*  Gaza health officials say more than 80 people have been killed by Israeli airstrikes since the ceasefire was announced. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=75.96s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Ramion Osensio has more from Tel Aviv. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=81.72s)]
*  Yes, an Israeli official tonight confirmed to CBS News that the cabinet will convene tomorrow, Friday, to decide whether to approve that ceasefire and hostage deal. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=85.72s)]
*  And this is important because it was a day of anxiety just after that deal was announced. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=96.76s)]
*  This morning, we woke to news that cabinet meetings to approve that deal would not go ahead after the prime minister's office accused Hamas of reneging on the deal, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=104.28s)]
*  to try to extract more concessions. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=114.96s)]
*  Israeli media reported that Hamas basically wanted to choose which Palestinian detainees that it could get in exchange for Israeli hostages. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=117.52s)]
*  And I need to say that CBS News can't confirm that itself, but an Israeli official did tell us it did have to do something with Palestinian prisoners. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=126.64s)]
*  That, we know now, is resolved. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=136.04s)]
*  And we may see hostages released as soon as Sunday, but with this delay, it perhaps could be a little bit later. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=138.44s)]
*  But until that deal is signed, the IDF as well continues to bomb Gaza. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=145.64s)]
*  Overnight, there was an airstrike on a house in Gaza City, also on a mosque. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=151.23999999999998s)]
*  Our CBS News team in Gaza told us at least 77 people have been killed since we broke the news last night of the deal. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=155.23999999999998s)]
*  At the same time, we also know humanitarian aid trucks are on the move. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=163.32s)]
*  Some are amassing on Gaza's southern border with Egypt in the border town of El Arish. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  That's just about 30 miles from Rafa. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=172.68s)]
*  Preps are being made to try to open that Rafa border crossing that has been closed since May. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=174.84s)]
*  Food, water and medical supplies all waiting to get in. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=180.64s)]
*  But first, we wait for that deal to be signed. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=185.0s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=188.04s)]
*  Rami Anasensio, thank you. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  John Alterman joins us now. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=190.56s)]
*  He's the senior vice president and director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=191.67999999999998s)]
*  John, thanks for being here. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=196.56s)]
*  What do you make of this last minute uncertainty or, as the secretary would say, loose end regarding the ceasefire deal? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm a little surprised. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=203.83999999999997s)]
*  For a while, I thought it was maybe delaying it until President Trump is president once again. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  That still may be what's going on. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=210.88s)]
*  But I have every confidence that at this point, this deal is going to go forward. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=212.16s)]
*  How far it goes, as we talked about a couple of days ago, I'm not really sure. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  But it seems to me at least the beginning is likely to start within the next few days, whether it's under the Biden administration, the Trump administration will just have to wait and see. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  And assuming the deal holds, what happens next with Hamas? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=229.12s)]
*  Would you expect it to maintain control of Gaza even after Israel killed many of its senior leaders? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm not sure how much control they'll have. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  They'll certainly want to maintain as much control as they can. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=240.32s)]
*  And that's going to be one of the things that is going to be unfolding in the next few weeks. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=243.48000000000002s)]
*  And for Israelis, certainly hardline Israeli ministers who are skeptical of the deal to start with, some of whom said they will leave the government if this goes forward. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=247.72s)]
*  They're going to watch just how much control, how much influence Hamas has. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=258.2s)]
*  And that's going to determine whether they stay in the government or leave the government. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=263.96000000000004s)]
*  Interestingly, the head of the opposition said, we will give you the security to go forward, Mr. Prime Minister, to make this deal happen. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=268.04s)]
*  So what Netanyahu has managed to do is he's managed to give himself clearance to abandon the deal, clearance to go forward with the deal. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=277.8s)]
*  He can go either way. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=286.6s)]
*  What are the hangups for some of the people in his government who oppose the deal? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=287.8s)]
*  Look, there are a lot of people who take the prime minister of his word that the goal of this is to completely destroy Hamas. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=292.76s)]
*  Hamas has clearly not been completely destroyed. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  And there are some people who argue fairly that if that's the goal, the goal hasn't been reached. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=303.0s)]
*  We should keep fighting. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=309.56s)]
*  There are others who argue the important thing is saving innocent Israeli lives. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=310.6s)]
*  Let's continue to fight against Hamas. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=314.6s)]
*  But the important thing is getting getting some innocent people home. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=317.16s)]
*  That's a difference that Netanyahu seemed to find a way to split and maintain his control and power through whatever happens. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=320.92s)]
*  So what is going to be that measure in the next six weeks once this deal is implemented prior to that would lead to negotiation of phase two? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  We know that President-elect Trump's incoming national security adviser said they would support Israel. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=336.52s)]
*  They needed to resume its offensive in Gaza. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=340.52s)]
*  What's the red line for Israel? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=342.52s)]
*  Well, there are a whole series of questions about who is going to be released, whether they'll be alive. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  There are going to have to be negotiations about the male Israeli soldiers and what the terms of that will be, whether there actually will be a ceasefire. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=351.64000000000004s)]
*  I think, in fact, President Trump and his team are going to come in with a huge mediation problem to judge whether each side is meeting its obligations. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=359.96000000000004s)]
*  The other thing I think is there are going to be efforts on some of the right wing ministers in the government to move forward on gaining more control of the West Bank. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=370.44s)]
*  I think they think President Trump and his team will be sympathetic and President Trump and his team will have to negotiate that as well. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=380.2s)]
*  Well, we will be calling upon you in the days and weeks to come, particularly as the new administration enters its second term. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=385.96000000000004s)]
*  John Alterman, thank you. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=391.64s)]
*  Thank you, Lindsay. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhr5nMdDXc8&t=392.6s)]
