# Trump doubles down on tariffs in address to Congress; Administration may change GDP calculation
**CBS News:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w)
*  Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again and it's happening [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=0.0s)]
*  and it will happen rather quickly. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=5.66s)]
*  There'll be a little disturbance, but we're okay with that. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  It won't be much. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=13.08s)]
*  Of course, that is President Trump last night reinforcing his decision to impose tariffs [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=14.08s)]
*  on Mexico, Canada, and China despite recent market turbulence. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=19.52s)]
*  But you see the Dow Jones Industrial Average next to me. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=24.12s)]
*  It's actually up slightly today. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=26.8s)]
*  Those three nations responded with reciprocal tariffs on U.S. goods and last night President [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=29.319999999999997s)]
*  Trump vowed, quote, whatever they tax us, we will tax them, end quote, and promised [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=33.76s)]
*  more reciprocal tariffs to come next month. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=38.56s)]
*  So what does this all mean? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=41.12s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger who is here with me in Studio [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=42.4s)]
*  55 in Living Color. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=46.32s)]
*  Jill, great to see you. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=48.32s)]
*  Let's separate the noise from the data. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=50.2s)]
*  What is changing on the tariff front, if anything? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=52.84s)]
*  Well, remember these tariffs were frozen for 30 days, so now they are in effect and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=55.64s)]
*  the president slapped an additional 10% on top of already announced 10% tariffs on China. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=60.0s)]
*  So taken all together, what I think we really need to understand is that some of these tariffs [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=66.12s)]
*  will work their way to your pocketbook very quickly, others will take a while. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=71.4s)]
*  So think about it this way. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=75.98s)]
*  Something perishable, a fruit, a vegetable, an avocado from Mexico, that is going to actually [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=77.46000000000001s)]
*  see an immediate impact. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=82.0s)]
*  First of all, we get a lot of stuff from Mexico when it comes to fruits and vegetables, 50 [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=84.08000000000001s)]
*  to 60%, and the things that are perishable, we've got to change, there are going to be [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  more immediate imports of those things. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  Whereas a car that's sitting on a lot today, your car will probably not change in price. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=94.92s)]
*  When new cars are assembled and put up for sale, there will be thousands of dollars, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=101.4s)]
*  or could be, a thousands of dollars difference from where they were just a month ago. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  So it will take a while. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=110.76s)]
*  Generally speaking, remember, the company that imports the good pays the tariff, and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=112.8s)]
*  usually that company passes along that tariff and pushes up the price. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=118.44s)]
*  That's why we worry about inflation re-accelerating. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=123.28s)]
*  That's a great way of kind of comparing the smaller picture to the big picture, but I [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=125.64s)]
*  want to ask you about the even bigger picture. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=129.16s)]
*  There was an announcement from the Trump administration, there may be a change in how GDP, gross domestic [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=131.78s)]
*  product, this great number that you love to cite all the time, a change in how it's calculated, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=138.32s)]
*  what's happening there? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=142.72s)]
*  Well, no change yet, but Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had said yesterday, I think [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=143.72s)]
*  we focused on this idea, he said, listen, the tariffs, they could be rolled back, they [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=149.24s)]
*  could be changed, a lot of focus on that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  Wonks like me were focused on something else, he said, which is, hey, maybe we're going [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=155.64s)]
*  to have different ways of calculating the gross domestic product. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=159.2s)]
*  That is our largest measure of what's going on in the U.S. economy. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=162.56s)]
*  The tally of all goods and services sold. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=166.38s)]
*  Now, what he may want to do is pull out some of the government part of that, and government [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=169.01999999999998s)]
*  spending accounts for 15, 16, 17 percent of all spending, so this would be actually a [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=173.9s)]
*  very big change. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=179.5s)]
*  So economists are focused, they're very worried that any changes that we get to the way that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=180.76s)]
*  data are released would impact how people might be feeling on the ground. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=186.74s)]
*  Hey, if the government says the economy is doing OK, and yet I feel like things are costing [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=191.86s)]
*  more or my friend got laid off, that would be a very, almost like a crazy making experience [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=196.62s)]
*  for anybody living on the ground. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=202.02s)]
*  So we're going to watch that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=204.02s)]
*  I think that could actually have a very interesting impact on how all economists approach what [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=205.32000000000002s)]
*  this next phase of the Trump administration looks like. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=209.78000000000003s)]
*  Can you just help us understand the logic of pulling out what the government spends? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=212.06s)]
*  Why even do that? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=214.86s)]
*  You know, I think it's very, I don't know what the why is, because I think that there's [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=215.86s)]
*  always this feeling that when your person is not in office, your team is not in office, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=220.22s)]
*  that there's something going on with the numbers. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=226.26s)]
*  What we do know is civil servants who run the data for the for the Labor Department [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=228.11999999999998s)]
*  and for all these government agencies, they've clung to these ways of calculating economic [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  progress and missteps as well for decades. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=237.6s)]
*  So any change in this would be very disruptive to the way that we analyze what's going on. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=241.42s)]
*  Of course, by the way, you know how you analyze what's going on? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=247.38s)]
*  A friend of mine once said this to me, a very big time Nobel Prize winning economist. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=250.14000000000001s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=253.74s)]
*  And you know what he said? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=254.74s)]
*  He goes, you know, when it comes to the world, there's basically two numbers. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=255.74s)]
*  100% I have a job, 0% I don't have a job. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=258.58s)]
*  Everything else flows from that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=262.62s)]
*  So if people are losing jobs, they won't spend money. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=263.92s)]
*  That's going to hurt economic growth. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=266.5s)]
*  That's why it's got that Nobel Prize, breaking things down so well. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=267.7s)]
*  If only I thought of that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=270.42s)]
*  Yours is due. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=271.42s)]
*  It's coming soon. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=272.42s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=273.42s)]
*  Great to have you with us. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3P4rrAL6w&t=274.42s)]
