# FBI turns in names of 5,000 employees to DOJ related to January 6 probes, U.S. official says
**CBS News:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k)
*  A U.S. official tells CBS News that the FBI has turned over the names of more than 5,000 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=0.0s)]
*  employees who worked on the January 6 investigation to the Justice Department. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=5.44s)]
*  More than a dozen agents are suing the DOJ over the request, and that number could grow. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=10.0s)]
*  CBS News Justice Department correspondent Scott McFarland is at our Washington bureau [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=13.96s)]
*  with more on this. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  So Scott, do we know any more about the list? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Why did the DOJ ask for these names and why did the FBI comply? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=20.2s)]
*  The FBI made this deadline that was set by the Acting Department of Justice leadership [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=24.6s)]
*  from midday today. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=29.48s)]
*  They met the deadline, the list has been handed over, and as you mentioned, Lindsay, it has [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  more than 5,000 names of agents and employees who are part of this enormous investigation, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=34.72s)]
*  the largest investigation in bureau history, one that yielded 1,500 plus arrests. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=41.24s)]
*  Why did the FBI comply? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=48.16s)]
*  Well, there's Acting Leadership at the FBI, which reported this out to the Acting Leadership [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=49.64s)]
*  of the Department of Justice. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=55.32s)]
*  Why did the Department of Justice want this? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=57.16s)]
*  Well, the Acting Deputy Attorney General of the United States, a man named Emil Bove, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=58.92s)]
*  who was a former defense attorney for Donald Trump in his criminal case in Manhattan, made [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  the argument that the January 6 prosecutions were a, quote, gross injustice, that the department [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=68.92s)]
*  wants to know who played a role in it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=75.16s)]
*  The gross injustice is quite a provocative argument by this Justice Department leadership [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=78.36s)]
*  that the FBI has turned over the names and the surveys' results. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  of those who've been questioned about it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=88.8s)]
*  Lindsay, there are so many things that need to be answered about this. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=90.55999999999999s)]
*  Will there be mass resignations or mass firings because of their participation in January 6th? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=95.16s)]
*  How will they be defended? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=100.28s)]
*  Because FBI employees, like many others, have some protections for their jobs. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=101.64s)]
*  There is some due process. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=106.16s)]
*  And as you well know, Lindsay, there wasn't a judge in America who laid a glove on the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=107.84s)]
*  FBI's work on the January 6 investigations. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=112.6s)]
*  They convicted 100 percent of the defendants who went on trial by jury. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  And like you pointed out yesterday, I believe it was yesterday, all the days are blending [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  together, but you had said no matter what they do with these lists, the message has [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=123.44s)]
*  been sent. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=127.76s)]
*  The questionnaire has already been sent out. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=128.76s)]
*  My next question to you is a twofer. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=130.56s)]
*  Why would people remember the name Emil Bove? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=132.08s)]
*  And what do we know about these lawsuits against the DOJ? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=134.4s)]
*  There are two so far, both of them on behalf of anonymous FBI employees who say, among [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=137.16s)]
*  other things, that yes, a message has been sent, a potentially chilling message to FBI [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  agents through the course of this investigation. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=147.2s)]
*  What's more, they're making the argument that due rights or due process has not been observed [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=149.6s)]
*  and that this list of 5,000 names, if it gets into the wrong hands, is a national security [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=154.12s)]
*  threat. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=160.04s)]
*  It's a risk to the safety of the agents because there's been such a high volume of threats [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=161.04s)]
*  against FBI employees who are known to be part of these January 6 investigations. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=166.72s)]
*  There are a lot of threats against a lot of people involved with these January 6 investigations. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=170.92s)]
*  They think it's just dangerous for there to be a list with the risk it will be released [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=174.92s)]
*  or leak out. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=179.44s)]
*  The Trump administration's Office of Policy and Management, or OPM, says at least 20,000 [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=180.44s)]
*  federal employees have accepted deferred resignation offers. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  Others are calling them buyouts. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=190.2s)]
*  Can you remind them what it entails and why some elected officials are urging employees [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=191.7s)]
*  not to take it? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=195.06s)]
*  20,000 so far, a deadline of Thursday might spike that number between now and then. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=196.18s)]
*  What's being offered is if you resign, money will be paid to you through September or October. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=201.58s)]
*  You'll get your money, you get to leave the government service and move on to other things. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=206.1s)]
*  Whole lot of bear traps there, according to some of the Democrats on Capitol Hill, some [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=210.38s)]
*  of whom are urging their constituents don't take this deal. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=214.74s)]
*  It's not a buyout. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=217.54s)]
*  The money's not reliable. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=218.54s)]
*  They may not make good on this. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=219.54s)]
*  This is such a novel, unprecedented thing. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=221.06s)]
*  But also, there's a concern about a mass departure of federal employees really costing us customer [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=223.9s)]
*  service as citizens. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=229.94s)]
*  These federal employees do deliver services that the public needs, from checks and benefits [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=231.42000000000002s)]
*  to delivery of the types of things your taxpayer money pays for. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=236.82s)]
*  We'll see how many more jump on board this idea of leaving the service for money and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=243.14000000000001s)]
*  whether the money comes through. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=247.82s)]
*  Scott McFarland, thank you. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3z-1wQwa6k&t=249.38s)]
