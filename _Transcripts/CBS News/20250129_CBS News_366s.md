# Outgoing DNC Chair Jaime Harrison on Democratic Party's future
**CBS News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE)
*  Welcome back. To America Decides, the Democratic National Committee will elect a new chair [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=0.0s)]
*  on Saturday. Our colleague Ed O'Keefe spoke with the outgoing head of the DNC, Jamie [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=5.0s)]
*  Harrison, about then-President Biden dropping out of the 2024 race and about the future of the party. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=9.56s)]
*  You know the lay of the party pretty well, and you know all the players. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=16.0s)]
*  I try to. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=19.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's your job to know. There were three or four people who would have done it if [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=21.48s)]
*  there either been more time or if there'd been some kind of pop-up primary system established. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=26.2s)]
*  Well, what we establish is we follow the rules, which basically said if you don't have a nominee, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=32.44s)]
*  right, then it's the delegates of the DNC, of the convention, who will determine. And so that day, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=40.04s)]
*  Ed, that Joe Biden dropped out, I called a few of the folks who I thought could possibly [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=47.16s)]
*  join some, be a part of the process, people who had expressed some interest down the road for running. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=55.16s)]
*  A handful of governors. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=61.31999999999999s)]
*  A handful of governors. And to a person, every single one of them said, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  I'm not going to run, I'm supporting Kamala Harris. And it was almost like I was chasing [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=67.39999999999999s)]
*  the Kamala Harris calls because they all said, I just talked to the VP and I have pledged my [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  support to her. So people made a decision not to run. Had they run, the rules had, we set up a [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=77.47999999999999s)]
*  process where they could have gone out and secured the signatures from a certain number [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=84.04s)]
*  of delegates and they would have been on a ballot and we would have gotten it all done before that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=89.56s)]
*  Ohio deadline, which was the first part of August. So there was a process. People made a decision [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=95.16000000000001s)]
*  not to participate in that process and Kamala Harris, because she did the work, was the winner. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=101.4s)]
*  You think your party, elements of your party, too focused on being perfect and not focused on winning? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=106.44000000000001s)]
*  I think there are moments in which I do feel that there are folks who are looking, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=111.0s)]
*  what's the saying about the good and the perfect? I always mess it up. But [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=119.64s)]
*  I feel that there's some folks who- [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=126.2s)]
*  Don't let perfect be the enemy of the good. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=128.44s)]
*  Yeah, don't let perfect be the enemy of the good. I think there's some folks who do fall [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=129.56s)]
*  in that trap sometimes. If you do not fit into, you check these certain bucket items, then you're [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=136.36s)]
*  cast out or you're put on the bench or the back burner. We are a diverse party. This is a diverse [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  country. We come to this from different perspectives and we're not always going to agree on everything. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=152.84s)]
*  I love my wife more than life itself and I can tell you, we don't agree on every single thing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=158.52s)]
*  I'm sure you and your wife don't agree on every single thing, right? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=162.76000000000002s)]
*  That doesn't mean then you discard and say, oh, I'm taking my ball and going home or I can't talk [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=166.76s)]
*  to you anymore. No, you take the time to work it out because there is some commonality there [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=172.12s)]
*  and you build from the commonality up. I hope more of our folks get to understand that. You got to be [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=177.64s)]
*  more elastic than rigid. Sometimes we got folks that are very rigid. If you don't have the right [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=182.84s)]
*  job, if you didn't come from the right community, if you don't say the right word and then therefore [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  you are exed out or you're castigated. I do believe we need to pause on that. Let's be a big tent [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=193.88s)]
*  and let's be an open tent and embrace more diversity in terms of thought. So looking ahead, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=200.44s)]
*  should Kamala Harris run again? Yes, she wants to. You think she could win? I believe she can. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=206.2s)]
*  If I didn't believe Kamala Harris could win, I wouldn't have worked as hard as I did to help her [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=213.4s)]
*  win this last time around. You know, Donald Trump and when you look at politics, Donald Trump and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=218.92s)]
*  Barack Obama are just enigmas in politics. I think they do something different to the elector, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=224.44s)]
*  every time they run, that you can't counter. But then when they are not on the ballot, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=230.76s)]
*  it's almost like you go back to the political gravity pulls people right back into it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  That's part of how we won with the, how well we did in the midterms. So you're saying Donald [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=241.32s)]
*  Trump was unbeatable? No, not he wasn't. Joe Biden figured out how to, right? But Kamala Harris [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=246.44s)]
*  could have used more time and other things. But in the end of the day, Trump won't be on the ballot. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=254.68s)]
*  He's a lame duck now. And so the question is, who will be on the ballot for the Republicans and who [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=260.84s)]
*  will be on the ballot for the Democrats? And how will the Republicans play their hand over the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=267.08s)]
*  course of the next four years? And looking at how they play the hand so far, that's why I'm [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  very confident that Democrats will take back the House in 26. You've got a race to succeed you on [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=277.08s)]
*  Saturday. Who should replace you as DNC chair? Well, I will let the members of the DNC determine [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=281.96s)]
*  that. But the one thing that I, we're going to hand over a strong Democratic party. I've been [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=288.44s)]
*  in this building now for eight years. Four years as associate chair under Tom Perez, and then four [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=293.24s)]
*  years as DNC chair. When I think back to the DNC, when we walked in this door in 2017, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=298.6s)]
*  this is, this place is much stronger than what it was at that point in time. The data and the tech [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=305.16s)]
*  investments that we've made under my chairmanship, you know, people talk about Howard Dean and the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=311.0s)]
*  50 state strategy. We have invested, we've had 50 state strategy on steroids because we've invested [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=315.8s)]
*  more money into state parties than any time in the history of the DNC. 176 years, no DNC has ever [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=322.12s)]
*  invested this amount of resources. And now we have set a new floor for what the next DNC has to do. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=328.2s)]
*  A lot of people around you, Congressman Clyburn, some of your associates here, have endorsed Ken [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=334.36s)]
*  Martin. Why not just endorse Ken Martin? Because I- Wouldn't he be the best continuation of- [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=340.44s)]
*  I said a very big, Ken is a dear friend of mine, and I think he would be one hell of a chair. But [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=346.12s)]
*  there are a lot of good candidates who I think he would do a really good job as chair as well. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=351.8s)]
*  I said when I started this process that I was not going to publicly endorse and do that, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=356.2s)]
*  and I'm going to continue that. Good to hear from Ed O'Keefe and the outgoing chair there, Jamie Harrison. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TON1J35uncE&t=360.12s)]
