# At least 10 killed in Los Angeles wildfires as crews continue to battle blazes
**CBS News:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M)
*  We begin this morning with those deadly wildfires in Southern California. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=0.0s)]
*  Officials now say at least 10 people have been killed and thousands of homes, businesses [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=5.16s)]
*  and other structures have been absolutely destroyed. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=9.96s)]
*  At this moment, authorities are battling five wildfires around Los Angeles. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=13.36s)]
*  The largest remains the Palisades fire. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=17.16s)]
*  It's ballooned now to nearly 20,000 acres in size and is just 6% contained. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=20.12s)]
*  Speaking at the White House yesterday, President Biden announced the federal government will [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=25.84s)]
*  cover all of the disaster response costs from those wildfires for the next six months. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=29.56s)]
*  Meantime, LA Mayor Karen Bass is facing criticism over her response to the wildfires. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=35.0s)]
*  And I also said that when the fires are out, we will do a deep dive. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=41.2s)]
*  We will look at what worked. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=46.04s)]
*  We will look at what didn't work. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  And we will let you know. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=49.12s)]
*  Until then, my focus is on the TV screens behind you that are showing devastation that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  has continued. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  Joining us now for more on the situation in Southern California is CBS News correspondent [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  Danya Backers continuing to log long hours in this dangerous situation. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=62.6s)]
*  Give us an update today, Danya. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=67.0s)]
*  What does it feel like on the ground? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  How are the wind conditions? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the wind conditions are still an issue here. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=73.56s)]
*  We are under wind warnings where gusts in some areas could reach up to 60 miles per hour. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=77.36s)]
*  But they're also saying that in areas like the Palisades fire that that wind gust could [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=84.24s)]
*  only reach up to about 20 or 30 miles per hour. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  I know that sounds like, wait a minute, that's still significant because it is. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=92.0s)]
*  But at least we're not seeing those wind gusts of up to 100 miles per hour that we saw a [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=96.64s)]
*  couple of days ago. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=101.52s)]
*  We know this intense firefight is continuing at this hour with thousands of firefighters [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=102.94s)]
*  working on the ground and from the air. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=108.66s)]
*  They have been able to make a little bit of progress. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=112.88s)]
*  Not significant though in terms of containment of the fire. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=115.33999999999999s)]
*  And we do know that we are still seeing just the utter devastation from the fire, that [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=118.25999999999999s)]
*  people are now able to return to their homes. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=124.14s)]
*  And I say able to return as in police are letting them go through if they need to get [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=126.94s)]
*  things like medication or serious things that they need to get out. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=132.26s)]
*  They have to show ID and go through a lot of security in order to get to their homes. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=137.14s)]
*  But if they are allowed in and they're able to see the devastation, we've been able to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=141.36s)]
*  talk to folks who have lost absolutely everything who are still in a state of shock. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=145.0s)]
*  We also know that the death toll is continuing to rise. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  We are at 10, but officials say they are expecting that number to rise because they will start [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  sending cadaver dogs to go through the rubble. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=158.4s)]
*  So this is still a very active situation and that firefight still continues. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=161.3s)]
*  Errol? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=166.16000000000003s)]
*  Meantime, there's been some looting and arrests. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=167.16000000000003s)]
*  Errol, can you tell us about these curfews in place now? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=169.56s)]
*  Yeah, there's been looting and arrests. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  And a couple of days ago, officials said that they were concerned about looting and people [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=176.96s)]
*  taking advantage of the evacuation orders and the fact that there are so many homes [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=181.68s)]
*  that are empty, so many areas that are empty and just completely wiped out by fire. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=186.2s)]
*  So we already know that right now Santa Monica has already ordered a nighttime curfew and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=191.7s)]
*  LA is also planning to do the same thing to make sure that no one's able to get into these [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=197.12s)]
*  areas without proper personnel there to check them out. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=201.84s)]
*  All right, that live reporting from Dona Bacchus in the Pacific Palisades. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  Dona, thank you so much. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=209.4s)]
*  Now, some people are returning to their homes or at least what's left of them to see what [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=211.12s)]
*  they can salvage. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=216.76s)]
*  We have new video from a family in Altadena, California. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=217.96s)]
*  You see a man with a shovel there. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=221.48s)]
*  His mother bought this house. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=224.3s)]
*  He came to look for anything he could pick up, things his mother wanted, but said he [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=226.14s)]
*  didn't find much. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=231.0s)]
*  Well, I thought I was going to be sadder, you know, I thought, but I'm actually happy [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=234.0s)]
*  that everybody's safe. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  And I'm looking at just everything. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=242.7s)]
*  I've been here since 1977. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=245.61999999999998s)]
*  So I'm looking at everything, the things that we added, furniture, white furniture. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=249.06s)]
*  We feel so much for all of the evacuees and survivors. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=255.98s)]
*  The Eton fire which torched that house is zero percent contained, according to Cal Fire. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ0ZilEp7M&t=258.98s)]
