# U.S. Rep. Sylvester Turner dies at 70, just weeks after taking office
**CBS News:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14)
*  All right, we're following this breaking news just into our newsroom. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=0.0s)]
*  Congressman Sylvester Turner has died. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=7.36s)]
*  He is a Democrat from Texas representing the state's 18th district, which includes parts [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=10.4s)]
*  of Houston and the surrounding area. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=15.76s)]
*  He himself a former mayor of Houston. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=18.46s)]
*  CBS News congressional correspondent Nicole Killian is back with us on this breaking news. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=20.88s)]
*  Nicole, what are you hearing? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=25.8s)]
*  Well, we are still trying to gather information and don't have all the details about the circumstances [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=28.72s)]
*  other than multiple sources have confirmed to CBS News that the Texas congressman has died. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=35.68s)]
*  Of course, Sylvester Turner was the former mayor of Houston, Texas, was quite popular in that city, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=42.48s)]
*  and was just in his freshman term here in Congress after a special election to replace [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=50.64s)]
*  the late congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, who served in that seat for many, many years, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  but died last summer after a battle with pancreatic cancer. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=65.28s)]
*  Her daughter, in fact, temporarily replaced her at the end of the last session of Congress [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=69.76s)]
*  until Sylvester Turner was elected and assumed the seat at the beginning of this Congress. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=75.36s)]
*  But it does certainly come as a shock given his political history and as someone who, again, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=82.16s)]
*  is well known in Houston, served the city of Houston for many, many years. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=90.48s)]
*  So again, we are still working to confirm additional details about the circumstances [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=96.88s)]
*  surrounding his death. We have reached out to his office for a statement and we'll certainly [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=101.6s)]
*  bring that to you as we hear more. That's right, Nicole, and I'm just looking at [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=106.64s)]
*  an article from the Houston Chronicle acknowledging this news saying Turner was 70 years old and that [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=111.36s)]
*  he was in Washington before passing away, and we understand he did attend the president's address [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  to a joint session of Congress last night. So something obviously would have taken a turn for [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=123.91999999999999s)]
*  the worse afterward. Any indication on what that may have been or how things unfolded last night? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=129.2s)]
*  Well, again, that's where we are working to confirm additional details surrounding the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=135.44s)]
*  circumstances of his passing beyond a source confirming that he was at the joint address [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=139.76s)]
*  last night. And of course, worth noting, this came at a time where his fellow Texan, Al Green, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  of course, was escorted off the floor. Of course, we've been talking throughout the morning about [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=152.32s)]
*  how heated and tense the joint address was in terms of the reception that President Trump received. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=158.08s)]
*  But again, in terms of the specific details surrounding Congressman Turner's passing, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=164.96s)]
*  we simply don't have much information to go on at this point, Errol. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  All right, Nicole Killian, we appreciate you connecting with us and at least giving us the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=174.72000000000003s)]
*  very latest information on this breaking news event. US Representative Sylvester Turner, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=178.32000000000002s)]
*  70 years old, has died. Nicole, thank you. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1yt9ndB14&t=183.12s)]
