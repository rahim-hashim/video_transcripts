# Sen. Chris Van Hollen on Trump's "buyout" offer, Russell Vought filibuster and more
**CBS News:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY)
*  And we are joined now by Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, thank you so much for being with me. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=5.0s)]
*  I want to start with this short-term delay in the deadline for federal workers to take [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=7.44s)]
*  a deferred resignation. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=11.52s)]
*  You represent hundreds of thousands of federal workers who live in your state of Maryland. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=13.4s)]
*  What's your message to constituents who are trying to decide what to do? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=17.76s)]
*  Well, Nancy, it's good to be with you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  My message has been proceed with great caution before you jump at this proposal. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=25.92s)]
*  It's a proposal that really came from Elon Musk. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=33.32s)]
*  The memo that came out to federal employees was labeled fork in the road, which is exactly [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  the language that Elon Musk sent to his employees at one of his companies. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=42.56s)]
*  So I think they need to proceed with great caution. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=48.52s)]
*  It's not clear that the Trump administration has the authority to do this. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=51.6s)]
*  So I'm glad that the judge paused this today. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=55.32s)]
*  Russell Vogt, who is the president's nominee to lead the Office of Management and Budget, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=59.64s)]
*  or OMB, he's one of the architects of this fork in the road buyout plan. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=63.88s)]
*  And you and other Democratic senators have been essentially filibustering on the Senate [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=68.64s)]
*  floor talking for 24 hours straight to try to hold up a confirmation vote for Russell Vogt. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  Now, why did you decide to take that approach on this one particular nominee? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=79.28s)]
*  And can we expect to see a similar strategy for others? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=83.8s)]
*  Well, you're right, Nancy. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=88.32s)]
*  I just spent a lot of time today on the Senate floor urging my colleagues to vote against [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=89.16s)]
*  Russell Vogt. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=94.28s)]
*  He was the architect of Project 2025. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=95.8s)]
*  And, you know, it's interesting to think back to the campaign when Donald Trump was asked [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=99.24s)]
*  about Project 2025. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=103.6s)]
*  He said, I don't have anything to do with it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=105.08s)]
*  Don't know anything about it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=106.6s)]
*  Well, he is installing the architect of that Project 2025 in this key position in the White [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=107.56s)]
*  House. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=114.44s)]
*  The OMB director is like the command and control guy for the budget of the U.S. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=115.24s)]
*  government. And at his hearing in the Budget Committee, he refused to agree that he would [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=120.19999999999999s)]
*  comply with the law, specifically the Empowerment Control Act. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=125.44s)]
*  And that's, you know, one of the executive orders, illegal executive orders issued by [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=129.76s)]
*  President Trump, one of the ones that is subject to a temporary restraining order, is exactly [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=134.48s)]
*  that, the illegal withholding of funds. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=139.56s)]
*  So Russ Vogt was in this position before he broke the law before, according to GAO. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=141.44s)]
*  I really hope our Republican colleagues have second thoughts. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=147.16s)]
*  Do you think they will? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=151.48s)]
*  Based on the discussion on the Senate floor, the answer is no. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=153.8s)]
*  But I would just say the reason you're seeing this flood of lawsuits is because you're seeing [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=157.8s)]
*  a flood of illegal executive orders. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=163.64s)]
*  You have Elon Musk literally taking over agencies of the federal government. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=167.39999999999998s)]
*  And at some point, you would hope that Republican senators would recognize that the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=173.72s)]
*  constitutional authority given to Congress under Article One is just being slashed and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=180.32s)]
*  burned by President Trump and Elon Musk. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  So I hope at some point they decide to respect the Constitution and their responsibilities [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=189.88s)]
*  under the Constitution. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=196.68s)]
*  Senator, I want to ask you about the major cuts at USAID. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=198.51999999999998s)]
*  Here's what Secretary of State Marco Rubio, your former Senate colleague, told U.S. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=202.16s)]
*  diplomats in Guatemala City yesterday behind closed doors. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=206.4s)]
*  He said the United States is not walking away from foreign aid. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=209.44s)]
*  It's not. We're going to continue to provide foreign aid and to be involved in programs, but it [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=214.24s)]
*  has to be programs that we can defend. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=219.24s)]
*  It has to be programs we can explain. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=222.0s)]
*  It has to be programs we can justify. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=224.08s)]
*  He seemed to suggest there that some of the programs that have been put on hold are going [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=227.08s)]
*  to be restored on a case by case basis. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=231.16s)]
*  Is that at all reassuring to you? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=234.32000000000002s)]
*  It's not. And here's why. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=237.84s)]
*  It's become pretty clear that Marco Rubio, Secretary Rubio, is not in charge of the operations [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=240.24s)]
*  at USAID. Elon Musk is in charge of the operations over it, over AID. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=248.08s)]
*  And it was it was Elon Musk who tweeted out the other day that he was putting AID through the woodchipper. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=254.56s)]
*  He said he was going to kill AID. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  He called it a criminal enterprise, which should be a surprise to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=264.16s)]
*  recognized for years on a bipartisan basis that AID is a very important part of our national security and foreign [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=269.96000000000004s)]
*  policy strategy. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=276.56s)]
*  So no, we got this letter from Secretary Rubio saying he wanted to consult with Congress when days before Elon Musk shut down [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=278.64s)]
*  the Agency for International Development, told everybody to go home, has told everybody from overseas to come back to [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=287.72s)]
*  United States. And when I, with a number of colleagues, tried to go to AID and get in the building to talk to AID [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=294.92s)]
*  employees, they refused to let us in. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=302.16s)]
*  So Elon Musk is in control, not Secretary Rubio. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=304.20000000000005s)]
*  I want to ask you about another major foreign policy matter. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=308.88000000000005s)]
*  That's Israel and Gaza. You sit on the Foreign Relations Committee. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  You've called the president's plans for the U.S. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  to take over Gaza ethnic cleansing. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=317.36s)]
*  The White House now says that under the president's plans, the Palestinians would only be displaced temporarily. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=320.44000000000005s)]
*  They say the effort wouldn't involve U.S. troops, nor somehow would it involve any U.S. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=325.8s)]
*  cash, even though the president says we would own it and redevelop it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=330.72s)]
*  Do you think he's serious about this plan? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=335.52000000000004s)]
*  And as far as you can tell, do your Republican colleagues think he's serious about this plan? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=337.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, I don't know. All I know is what the president said. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=343.76000000000005s)]
*  And what the president said was that he wanted to transfer two million Palestinians out of Gaza. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=346.68s)]
*  He said he would be prepared to use the U.S. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=354.64000000000004s)]
*  military to clean out Gaza. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=357.48s)]
*  That is ethnic cleansing by another name. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=360.56s)]
*  He says he wants to redevelop Gaza and that maybe someday some of those Palestinians can come back. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=363.44s)]
*  Well, this is all a bunch of, you know, I don't know if he's serious or not, but if he is, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=371.32s)]
*  it's just astounding to hear a president of the United States say that they want to use U.S. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=378.32s)]
*  power influence and even the military to forcibly transfer two million people from their homeland. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=382.92s)]
*  Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, thank you so much for being with us today. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=392.04s)]
*  I appreciate it. Good to be with you. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI7sGI-BgbY&t=395.32s)]
