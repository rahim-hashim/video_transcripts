**CBS News:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg)
*  A national day of mourning declared in Turkey today following a deadly fire at a ski resort. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=0.0s)]
*  The 12-story hotel was packed with guests. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=4.72s)]
*  At least 76 people have died and dozens more have been injured. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=7.36s)]
*  Nine people have been detained as part of the investigation into what happened. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  BBC Turkish reporter Ezra Yalçınap joins us now from the town of Bolu, where this tragedy [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=14.92s)]
*  occurred. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Ezra, so much for being with us. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  You went to the funeral home for one of the victims. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=25.060000000000002s)]
*  What more are you learning about those who lost their lives? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=27.56s)]
*  What did the family members tell you? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=30.36s)]
*  Yes, it was a school holiday. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=33.36s)]
*  It was a two-week school holiday that started on Monday and then the next morning this happens. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=38.64s)]
*  So you can expect that there are many, many families with their kids and trying to enjoy [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=44.56s)]
*  the holiday at a ski resort, as a well-established ski resort, matter of fact. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=49.8s)]
*  It has been around for decades. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=55.08s)]
*  It was a trustworthy institution, but nobody could have guessed that this could happen [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=57.12s)]
*  there. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=62.8s)]
*  We went to one of the funerals today, one of the first ones taking place at a mosque, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=63.8s)]
*  and we talked to the friends and the family and just the general public who attended this [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=70.24s)]
*  funeral. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=76.92s)]
*  Some of them were saying that no one can choose their death. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=77.92s)]
*  So this was part of fate. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  This was part of what God has written for them. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=85.28s)]
*  But some were asking questions. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=88.8s)]
*  Some were asking questions regarding the fire precautions, fire regulations, the fire inspections [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=91.44s)]
*  that did not or did took place at the hotel. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=98.4s)]
*  There's an ongoing public discussion regarding whose jurisdiction was to inspect this hotel, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=103.48s)]
*  there are claims from the government, from the tourism and culture minister that this [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=112.48s)]
*  hotel was properly inspected in 2021 and 2024 and it had the proper two fire stairs as it's [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=119.28s)]
*  supposed to. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=130.4s)]
*  But on the other hand, the main opposition party's mayor, the mayor of Bolo, Tanja Özcan, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=131.4s)]
*  is claiming that this hotel was not properly inspected and there's definitely an ongoing [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=138.52s)]
*  public debate about who needs to do what. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=148.36s)]
*  So Ezra, can you confirm that there were not any working fire alarms in the hotel? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=152.52s)]
*  And we're hearing from the owner of the hotel who was among those that have been arrested. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=160.72s)]
*  There are 12 people that we understand have been arrested in connection to this investigation. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=167.6s)]
*  What do authorities believe happened? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=172.32s)]
*  At this point, there are nine people arrested and one of those people are the hotel's owner. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=177.0s)]
*  This is the numbers from the minister of justice. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=186.12s)]
*  And it has been reported that the survivors did not hear any fire alarms. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=190.2s)]
*  They were woken up by people knocking on their doors and just woke up by the commotion taking place. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=196.72s)]
*  So there were multiple reports of a fire alarm not existing. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=203.72s)]
*  And also it has been reported that the fire started from the kitchen, from a regular cooking [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=210.04s)]
*  accident possibly. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=217.64s)]
*  There were no sprinklers, so the fire could fast take place and travel through the different [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=219.84s)]
*  floors and reach up to the top floor, to the ceiling, to the top floor of the hotel, which [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=227.96s)]
*  is a 12-story hotel. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=235.16s)]
*  And it's located on a very steep hill. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=236.88s)]
*  Therefore, the fire brigades, which were not present at the ski resort, the ski resort [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  Cartagena is one hour from the city center and the fire brigade came one hour later. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=247.24s)]
*  So there was a lot of discussion about what should have happened when the fire took place [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=252.76s)]
*  in this hotel. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=258.56s)]
*  Excellent reporting. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=261.56s)]
*  Ezra Yalchenow, thank you very, very much. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=262.56s)]
*  What a tragedy. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=265.08s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=266.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-mQQs25iNg&t=267.08s)]
