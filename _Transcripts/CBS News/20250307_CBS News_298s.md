# How Mexico is reacting to Trump's tariffs moves
**CBS News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4)
*  Well, amid fears of a broader trade war, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=0.0s)]
*  President Donald Trump delayed some tariffs [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=2.24s)]
*  on Mexico and Canada this week. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=5.0s)]
*  We're talking about items only covered [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=6.5s)]
*  under a 2020 trade agreement between the countries. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=8.5s)]
*  So let's go to our neighbors in Mexico, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=11.44s)]
*  an Azteca noticias anchor, Lucy Bravo. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=13.98s)]
*  Welcome, Lucy. Nice to have you on the stream. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=16.48s)]
*  Talk to us about what you are seeing there [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=19.32s)]
*  as this pause has now happened in tariffs. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=21.42s)]
*  Yes, thank you, Rita. Thank you for having me. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=24.72s)]
*  And as you mentioned, the tariffs on Mexico and Canada [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=27.22s)]
*  have been delayed for yet another month, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=29.86s)]
*  buying some time for further negotiations [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=32.36s)]
*  while keeping the pressure on the Mexican government [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  to address U.S. concerns on fentanyl and immigration. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=37.36s)]
*  The markets received the news rather well. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=40.96s)]
*  Actually, the peso gained some ground [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=43.46s)]
*  against the dollar yesterday, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=45.64s)]
*  registering its strongest level since the year began. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=47.54s)]
*  But uncertainty in the US market [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=50.379999999999995s)]
*  remains as to whether the Mexican government [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=52.900000000000006s)]
*  will continue to take decisive action [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=55.540000000000006s)]
*  and prevent the auto manufacturing [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=57.940000000000005s)]
*  or agricultural industries from taking a major hit. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=61.28s)]
*  Bear in mind that this exemption applies [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=65.28s)]
*  to about 90% of Mexican exports to the U.S. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  as part of the USMCA agreement. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  But we are still facing the tariffs on steel and aluminum [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=75.06s)]
*  that are set to go into effect next week. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=79.1s)]
*  Nonetheless, President Sheinbaum is moving ahead [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=82.02s)]
*  with a massive event planned to take place [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=84.06s)]
*  this coming Sunday at our country's Zocalo, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=87.36s)]
*  which is our main square located in our downtown area, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=89.76s)]
*  just a few steps from the presidential palace [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=93.34s)]
*  where the executive branch seats [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=95.7s)]
*  as a show of political force. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=97.7s)]
*  But behind closed doors, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=100.18s)]
*  we expect that the Mexican government [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=101.98s)]
*  will continue to double down on its security measures [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=103.62s)]
*  and border enforcement to show Trump [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=106.82000000000001s)]
*  that it's taking decisive action. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=108.62s)]
*  As a matter of fact, President Sheinbaum [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=111.42s)]
*  highlighted this 41.5% drop on fentanyl trafficking [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=113.72s)]
*  during the last month as part of its broader actions [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=118.76s)]
*  that it's taking as well and as part of what Trump requested. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=123.76s)]
*  But it is still uncertain whether that will be enough [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=128.76s)]
*  to actually reach the agreements [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=132.04s)]
*  that Trump has put on the table. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=136.38s)]
*  And we know that the next coming weeks will be crucial [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=139.8s)]
*  to determine whether this exemption will be a temporary pause [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=142.8s)]
*  or it can actually lead to a resolution [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=147.14000000000001s)]
*  and avoid a full economic clash between our two countries. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=149.94s)]
*  Well, and we know it is a temporary pause [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=153.6s)]
*  because we're looking at an early April warning [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=155.2s)]
*  from the president that if they can't get anywhere [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=157.84s)]
*  between the two presidents, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=159.88s)]
*  that this tariff could go back in place in full force. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=161.78s)]
*  At the top of our discussion, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=164.88s)]
*  we were showing you some of those agricultural products [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=166.24s)]
*  here in the United States, avocados among them. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  Our partners at CBS Bay Area saw that the prices [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=172.42s)]
*  for guacamole went from $13 a bowl to almost $17 a bowl [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=176.01999999999998s)]
*  because those restaurateurs were anticipating a spike [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=180.62s)]
*  in those agricultural prices. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=183.76s)]
*  So really it punctuates the importance of this call [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=186.1s)]
*  between the two presidents. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=188.66s)]
*  What do you know about how well they're communicating [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=189.96s)]
*  and whether they can actually find common ground [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=192.6s)]
*  to get a deal done? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=194.68s)]
*  Well, from what we've seen and from what the president [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=196.84s)]
*  has let the people know, they have a very good relation. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=200.16s)]
*  They have very good report. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  And she was able to highlight some of the results [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=205.96s)]
*  that the Mexican government has presented [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=208.2s)]
*  just in the past month. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=210.2s)]
*  And she did mention the fact that if he were to impose [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=211.6s)]
*  the tariffs, then what would be the incentives [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=214.64s)]
*  for the Mexican government to continue to cooperate [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=216.51999999999998s)]
*  on these matters? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=219.64s)]
*  Nonetheless, she insisted on the fact that our partners [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=221.24s)]
*  are working closely with our U.S. allies [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=224.84s)]
*  to reach a permanent resolution, a permanent deal. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is that the deadlines [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  of each month that have been delayed have provided results. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=234.04000000000002s)]
*  And the question remains whether this will be [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  a permanent situation for the next couple of years [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=241.56s)]
*  or we will be able to reach a permanent solution. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=244.36s)]
*  Nonetheless, the price hikes that you mentioned [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=248.16s)]
*  are also affecting our relationship with the U.S. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  and affecting our side of the border. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=254.16s)]
*  And some of the manufacturers as well as the farmers [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=256.04s)]
*  are still grappling with solutions, are waiting to know [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=260.36s)]
*  what the government of Mexico will do in order to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=264.04s)]
*  alleviate some of these measures. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=267.92s)]
*  The president has kept her cards very close to the chest [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=269.6s)]
*  and she hasn't revealed any type of reciprocal tariffs [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  which were expected to be announced this coming Sunday. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=276.8s)]
*  But she said that in spite, in view of this delay, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=279.32s)]
*  there is no need to even talk about those [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=283.72s)]
*  reciprocal tariffs anymore. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=286.92s)]
*  Well, those farmers on your side of the border [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  are also voters and no doubt President Schombach [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=291.16s)]
*  is feeling some of that political pressure as well. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=293.8s)]
*  Lucy Bravo, nice to talk to you there. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you for that perspective. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcMC3MET_N4&t=297.28000000000003s)]
