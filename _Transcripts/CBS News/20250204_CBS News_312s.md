# USAID missions shutting down, staff ordered to return from overseas
**CBS News:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24)
*  Multiple sources have confirmed to CBS News that all USAID overseas missions will be shut [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=0.0s)]
*  down and all staff members will be recalled by Friday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=5.86s)]
*  These sources tell CBS News that newly appointed USAID Deputy Administrator Pete Morocco made [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=10.34s)]
*  the order, adding that the military will conduct the evacuations if staff members do not leave [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=15.9s)]
*  their respective countries. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  This comes amid an overhaul of the humanitarian agency, which has seen dozens of senior officials [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=23.54s)]
*  placed on leave and thousands of contractors laid off. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=28.88s)]
*  Maura Reeve joins us now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=33.44s)]
*  She's a former senior at mental health and psychosocial support advisor for the USAID's [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=34.44s)]
*  Bureau for Global Health. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=38.76s)]
*  She was in Ethiopia on an assignment before being ordered to return home at her own expense [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=39.76s)]
*  before she was terminated without severance. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=45.44s)]
*  So Maura, what can you tell us about the work you were tasked with and the days leading [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=47.64s)]
*  up to your termination? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=51.4s)]
*  Yes, thank you for that. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=53.2s)]
*  It's nice to be here and I wish it was under more pleasant circumstances. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=56.16s)]
*  But just to give a brief explanation of what I was doing in Ethiopia, I was there to provide [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=60.16s)]
*  support specifically in terms of technical support for a project design that was going [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=67.56s)]
*  to be extended to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=74.19999999999999s)]
*  So these were women and children most likely that would be benefiting from this program. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=78.24s)]
*  I was also there to participate in a conflict sensitivity training. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  My role as mental health advisor was to make sure that we were also considering the mental [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=86.96s)]
*  health, the needs of the beneficiaries in terms of mental health and making sure that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=91.0s)]
*  programming was trauma informed. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=97.0s)]
*  So I had arrived on Friday and then by Monday was when I started receiving words that I [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  needed to return home immediately. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=107.52s)]
*  Because I had to take a vacation afterwards there had been a cost construct which was [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=111.4s)]
*  going to be my expense to pay out of pocket. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  But that invalidated my ticket and then I was ordered to return and to buy my own ticket [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=120.64s)]
*  essentially. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  What happens now that all of these USAID projects are either on hold or canceled? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=128.72s)]
*  What do you worry about in terms of the work that will go undone? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=133.56s)]
*  Yes, that's a really great question and it's a really important one. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  It's hard for me to kind of imagine what's going to happen in the future because at this [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=141.44s)]
*  point I just don't know. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=145.32s)]
*  It's really a powerless sort of situation and just thinking about the hundreds of millions [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  of people that have benefited from USAID services and support over the years and just women [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=153.44s)]
*  with babies that have been impacted by HIV and perinatal mental health and thinking about [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=162.0s)]
*  people with tuberculosis that are no longer going to have access to life-saving treatment [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=167.2s)]
*  and HIV, they're not going to be able to have life-saving treatment. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=171.36s)]
*  It's just extremely tragic. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=175.76s)]
*  It's hard to imagine. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=178.36s)]
*  The need is so great and we're not there to just give out charity. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=180.8s)]
*  We're there to strengthen health systems so the community, so people can participate in [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=185.48s)]
*  their communities and engage in their communities and strengthen their own communities. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=190.68s)]
*  So it's not about giving out handouts but about making communities so that they're able [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=195.32s)]
*  to thrive on their own, which makes the United States also a safer place when we don't have [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=200.36s)]
*  people coming to our borders because they can't get their needs met at home. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=207.16s)]
*  It's safer for us and also the United States of America. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=211.24s)]
*  Now, Maura, Elon Musk of Doge has called USAID full of worms. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=214.84s)]
*  Trump says it's being run by radical left lunatics. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=219.52s)]
*  What's your response? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=222.24s)]
*  These words are very damaging and very upsetting. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  And I've seen these, you know, when leadership starts using terms to diminuate people, to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=228.16000000000003s)]
*  be comparing them to cockroaches or rodents, it's very troubling. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=236.72s)]
*  We've seen these sorts of things in other tyrannies. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=241.08s)]
*  You know, it's a way when you're using these sorts of terms, the purpose is to create division. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=244.08s)]
*  So it makes me very sad to see that our leadership is using these sorts of terms [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=251.68s)]
*  because I think we're all people and we deserve to be better. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=258.16s)]
*  And the colleagues also to speak about the amazing colleagues I've worked with at USAID [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=263.04s)]
*  that now have been dedicating 20 years of their life or 15 years of their life, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=268.64s)]
*  given their whole life to making to the values of creating, you know, extending health to others [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=275.2s)]
*  that really need it, to think that they're now going to be out of employment. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=281.44s)]
*  We were dropped. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=286.56s)]
*  When I was terminated, I had two days of health insurance and now I have no health insurance [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=288.32s)]
*  coverage. So it's scary. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=293.2s)]
*  People with families and children to put through schools, it's really frightening. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=294.8s)]
*  We know this is a turbulent trying time for you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=300.08000000000004s)]
*  We appreciate you coming on describing everything, but we do hope you get back on your feet and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  that things look up from here. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you for sharing your story. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaRMwnPWx24&t=311.20000000000005s)]
