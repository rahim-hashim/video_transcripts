# Both sides of U.S.-Mexico border preparing for Trump's return
**CBS News:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM)
*  President-elect Donald Trump said he wants to dramatically shift immigration policy once [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=0.0s)]

*  While the number of illegal border crossings has steadily declined since June, thousands [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=9.64s)]
*  of migrants in Mexico are still desperately trying to enter the U.S. despite the president-elect's [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=13.8s)]
*  promise of harsher policies. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=18.56s)]
*  CBS News immigration and politics reporter Camila Montoya-Galvez took a trip to both sides [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=20.56s)]
*  of the southern border to see how law enforcement officials and migrants are preparing for the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=24.96s)]
*  next administration. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=29.36s)]
*  This has been a proven deterrent. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=32.04s)]
*  Along the U.S.-Mexico border, Arjone captured a group of migrants, including young children, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=34.96s)]
*  trying to enter the country illegally. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=40.4s)]
*  But they were unable to get past a razor wire set up by the state of Texas. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=43.0s)]
*  Some people may look at this and say, this looks like a war zone. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=47.08s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=50.56s)]
*  And to be honest, it kind of does. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=52.36s)]
*  It kind of resembles it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=55.4s)]
*  The tactic behind all this optic is doing what it just did right now. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  It prevents them from coming over illegally. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  Texas credited aggressive efforts for the current four-year low in illegal border crossings. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=64.48s)]
*  The Biden administration attributes that drop to asylum restrictions, Mexico's efforts to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=69.16s)]
*  stop migrants, and a phone app known as CBP-1 that allows up to 1,500 people per day to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  schedule legal crossings. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=80.68s)]
*  On the Mexican side of the border, we found a bottleneck of people desperate to enter [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  the U.S., awaiting the appointment under the app. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=89.96s)]
*  President-elect Trump has vowed to shut down the app, expand border restrictions and conduct [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=93.96s)]
*  mass deportations. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  Have you thought about crossing illegally? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=100.16s)]
*  You're saying everyone here to some degree thinks about that at some point because of [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  the desperation? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=112.96s)]
*  You almost did not make it out alive. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=113.96s)]
*  Venezuelan migrant Daikeli Aleman arrived in Mexico after crossing the deadly Darien [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=120.55999999999999s)]
*  jungle in Panama with her one-year-old daughter. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  Are you scared that it's going to become even more difficult to try to enter the U.S. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=128.44s)]
*  under the new administration? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=133.95999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=135.76s)]
*  Everyone has that concern. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=137.76s)]
*  Here in this food pantry in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, migrants from across Latin America [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=143.67999999999998s)]
*  can get food, water, basic necessities, clothing and legal services. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=147.72s)]
*  But now the concern is that the incoming Trump administration could derail their plans to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=152.88s)]
*  make it into the U.S. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=157.14s)]
*  Food pantry director Cristina Coronado worries Trump's plan to shut down the app could backfire, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  prompting more migrants to cross into the U.S. illegally. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=164.92s)]
*  There's a lot of uncertainty. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=170.55999999999997s)]
*  Anxiety too. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=171.56s)]
*  And lots of questions. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=172.56s)]
*  How long have you been waiting? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  One year waiting. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=184.56s)]
*  Haitian migrant Michele Nelson uses CBP-1 every morning, hoping to get her daughter a golden [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=185.56s)]
*  ticket into the U.S. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=192.04s)]
*  Everything you're doing now is for your daughter to have a better future. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=194.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=197.6s)]
*  That's all you want. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=198.6s)]
*  Whether that future will be in the U.S. is still to be determined. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M38lVfN_xyM&t=200.92000000000002s)]
