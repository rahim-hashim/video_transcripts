# How this AI celebrity video denouncing antisemitism fooled social media users
**CBS News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs)
*  A video depicting various celebrities protesting Yeh, also known as Kanye West, for his anti-Semitic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=0.0s)]
*  comments went viral on social media this week. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  However, the video is completely AI generated. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=9.4s)]
*  So this video uses the likeness of celebrities including Scarlett Johansson, Jerry Seinfeld [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=13.16s)]
*  and Adam Sandler without their permission and depicts them wearing a shirt with a middle [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=18.16s)]
*  finger and a star of David and Kanye's name underneath. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=22.5s)]
*  Johansson, who was depicted, as I mentioned in the video's opening shot, was critical [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=26.16s)]
*  of the video saying, quote, we must call out the misuse of AI no matter its messaging or [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=29.880000000000003s)]
*  we risk losing a hold on reality. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=34.8s)]
*  For more, let's bring in CBS News confirmed executive editor Rona Tarrant. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=36.88s)]
*  So Rona, when I first saw this, I mean, I'm a journalist. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=40.72s)]
*  I consider myself somebody who, you know, trust but verify. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=45.84s)]
*  This looked real to me. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=49.72s)]
*  What do we know about the origins of this video? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=50.72s)]
*  It looked real to me too. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=52.56s)]
*  When I looked at it first, it took me actually a few goes to figure out that it actually [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=53.84s)]
*  was AI. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=56.96s)]
*  So we traced it back to these two guys who live in Israel. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=58.2s)]
*  They work for an AI company. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=60.96s)]
*  Now, they posted it online after the Super Bowl to protest Kanye West's actions. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=62.36s)]
*  Now, they put it online. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=67.08s)]
*  They said, you know, they were denouncing his actions and they said, but, you know, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=68.4s)]
*  this is an AI generated video in the description. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=71.88s)]
*  Very small. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  Yes, and also in Hebrew. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=75.80000000000001s)]
*  So if you were looking at that original post, now what people did was they downloaded that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  video, re-uploaded it to their own accounts and did not include that disclaimer. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=81.24s)]
*  So it obviously fooled quite a lot of people online and annoyed at least one of the celebrities, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=85.88s)]
*  Scarlett Johansson. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=90.44s)]
*  Now, one of my colleagues, Leila, did speak to the guy who created it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=91.44s)]
*  He said he hadn't heard from any of the celebrities. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=94.24s)]
*  He also said he really didn't mean to mislead anybody, but that he was hoping to start a [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=96.08s)]
*  conversation around hate speech. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=100.6s)]
*  But as you know, when you put something out on the internet, it really is out of your [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=102.16s)]
*  hands. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=104.92s)]
*  It takes on a life of its own. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=105.92s)]
*  Anytime you're messing with somebody's likeness on AI, there's going to be some blowback. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=107.52s)]
*  So how can people do a better job of spotting something like this if, for example, the message [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=111.92s)]
*  happens to be in Hebrew? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  So I watched the video very slowly and there was a few signs. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  The biggest thing was the movements and the hands. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  AI is really bad on details. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=124.72s)]
*  So if you actually watch the video and you look at the hands, two of the celebrities [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  high five each other and their hands actually melt together. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  There's another instance where one of the celebrities, he's running his fingers through [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=134.28s)]
*  his hair and he actually only has three fingers on one of the hands. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=136.96s)]
*  And one of them as well, which is Steven Spielberg, the depiction of Steven Spielberg, when he [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  runs his fingers across his leg, they actually meld in together as well. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=144.44s)]
*  So it's really, these are really small details. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=148.36s)]
*  Oh man, you've got to be like, you've got to have a trained eye to be looking at that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=150.76000000000002s)]
*  stuff. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=154.24s)]
*  Yeah, and we downloaded it and paused it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=155.24s)]
*  So it actually took, and we do this stuff all the time, it was really hard. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=156.56s)]
*  I think the other thing to do is just look at the account. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  So is this actually coming from Scarlett Johansson's account, for example, or is it coming from [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=162.0s)]
*  this account that posts a lot of AI generated content? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=166.24s)]
*  And finally, you know, just checking trusted sources, getting off the platform, go on Google, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  see what people are saying about this online. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=173.56s)]
*  So some lawmakers and celebrities obviously have been critical of AI generated content. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=176.12s)]
*  What's the latest on legislation regarding generative AI? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=180.12s)]
*  Are we in an era right now where we're talking about more regulation or less? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=182.96s)]
*  Definitely more. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=187.44s)]
*  So a lot of states have regulations around AI, but a lot of it is really to do with politics [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=188.44s)]
*  and deep fake pornography. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=192.16s)]
*  So two areas where people kind of agree on a really small number of states have it around [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=193.52s)]
*  likeness, so people's images and voices. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=197.64s)]
*  There is an act, there is at least legislation that was introduced last year, it was proposed [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=200.4s)]
*  last year around that would protect people like Scarlett Johansson around their likeness [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=204.84s)]
*  and their voice being used. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=209.76s)]
*  Now that was only introduced last year, I should say. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=210.92s)]
*  So we'll see where that will level. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=213.04s)]
*  Yes, at the federal level. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=214.52s)]
*  So at the House and the Senate, it's at the committee stage right now. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=215.88s)]
*  So we'll see where that goes. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=218.64s)]
*  There's actually broad bipartisan support. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=219.64s)]
*  The problem is you also have enforcement, even if that does come in. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=222.12s)]
*  So number one, the AI companies would have to agree to it or at least have to enforce it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=225.08s)]
*  You'd also have the social media platforms would need to take things down. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=229.32s)]
*  The AI companies would be enforcing it, policing themselves? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=232.0s)]
*  So the AI companies, they would have to make sure that they are not allowing people to [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=236.16s)]
*  generate images of celebrities. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=240.32s)]
*  Now the thing about that is if they're a US-based company, that might be no problem. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=241.96s)]
*  But the internet's global, so these are global companies, so maybe you're not allowed to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=245.68s)]
*  with US-based products, but you could do it, say, for example, if you were living in Israel [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=249.96s)]
*  or India or wherever else it might be. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=254.28s)]
*  So the internet is global and that's a problem as well. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=256.44s)]
*  There may be legislation at a federal level coming in in the US, but the internet is global. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=258.32s)]
*  Brave new world. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=263.64s)]
*  Silver lining. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=265.24s)]
*  Job security for CBS News confirmed. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=266.32s)]
*  Rona Tarrant, thank you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=268.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53kzQo6qmVs&t=269.52s)]
