# Why Americans are participating in an "economic blackout" day
**CBS News:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8)
*  Many American Americans rather across the country won't swipe their credit [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=0.0s)]
*  cards today then that's because a nationwide protest is calling for a so [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=4.76s)]
*  called economic blackout organizers of the 24-hour boycott are basically telling [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=8.68s)]
*  people to not buy anything online or in store and the goal here is to take a [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  stand against rising prices and showcase the power of everyday people so on that [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=17.92s)]
*  note let's bring in CBS News money watch correspondent Kelly O'Grady Kelly [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=23.34s)]
*  thanks for joining us today on a Friday this is only for 24 hours we don't know [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=26.6s)]
*  exactly how many Americans are actually going to take part in this but what [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  happens if Americans stop spending for a day? So look if they start stop spending [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=34.4s)]
*  for a day it's not going to be that dramatic of an impact when you look at a [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=42.6s)]
*  Walmart or an Amazon because of course it's not going to be everyone that [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=48.36s)]
*  stops spending even though this movement does have a lot of traction on social [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=51.84s)]
*  media but I think where this this could evolve is you also have this group [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=55.52s)]
*  calling for targeted boycotts of Walmart for a week in the future Amazon for a [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=60.2s)]
*  week in the future this today this 24-hour economic blackout is supposed [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=65.2s)]
*  to be just the start and if it does gain enough traction the idea is to roll out [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=69.4s)]
*  even further down the road it is going to be hard to quantify as you suggest [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=74.16s)]
*  24 hours it's not like Walmart Amazon and some of these major retailers that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=78.56s)]
*  are specifically targeted in this boycott they're not going to release [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=82.48s)]
*  their sales numbers for the day but I think back to the Bud Light boycott for [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  example where for months consumers said no I'm not going to buy that I'm going [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=91.56s)]
*  to go buy an alternative so we have seen this type of sentiment and boycott work [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=96.04s)]
*  in the past and we did reach out Walmart Amazon and the other retailers that have [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=101.44s)]
*  been targeted in this boycott they're not commenting on the the planned boycott [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=105.64s)]
*  but what I will say Mugo is it does seem to have tapped into this customer [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=111.2s)]
*  frustration that is very timely with higher prices not feeling like your [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=116.11999999999999s)]
*  income is surpassing inflation and I do think that's why you have seen it take [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=120.64s)]
*  off on social media whether that actually translates into the store is [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=126.0s)]
*  something that we're gonna have to monitor all right well wait and see but [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  speaking of those high prices there is a new data point on inflation today what [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=132.88s)]
*  can you tell us about that okay so it's called PCE it is basically the feds [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=138.32s)]
*  preferred gauge of inflation good news it actually dropped versus December when [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=144.2s)]
*  you look at what we call core PCE that measures the price increase when you [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=150.52s)]
*  strip out food and energy the bad news is that the increases are coming from [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  your everyday items like utilities housing food gas we actually saw [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=158.4s)]
*  spending from consumers drop 0.2% we expected it to increase 0.3% so it goes [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=162.88s)]
*  back to that point people are feeling a bit anxious about where the economy is [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  right now they're pulling back their spending okay Kelly I know that you are [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=172.84s)]
*  a fan of the TV series series White Lotus and season 3 for those who are [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  also fans out there is out here and it's already sparking this buzz about [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=182.48s)]
*  something called the White Lotus effect what is that well the White Lotus [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=186.6s)]
*  effect for me when I watch it is I just like I'm cringing and I get so much [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=192.88s)]
*  anxiety but yes you're right you've outed me as a massive fan but the the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=195.95999999999998s)]
*  White Lotus effect in terms of the economic impact of it is people are [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=200.4s)]
*  getting excited about traveling to places that are featured in White Lotus [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=204.56s)]
*  so season one was the four seasons Maui season two was the four seasons in [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=208.64s)]
*  Termina in Italy and then Thailand is featured in the most recent season I [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=215.0s)]
*  have a couple of numbers for you okay to back this up so the four seasons has [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=219.6s)]
*  said that they've seen an increase in website traffic so Thailand 596 percent [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=223.96s)]
*  versus the past year and then you can see the numbers for Italy and Maui there [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=230.72s)]
*  so it just shows people see this on TV and they're excited and they want to go [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQWZtU-qO8&t=235.24s)]
