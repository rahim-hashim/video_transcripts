# Trump inauguration luncheon begins with invocation
**CBS News:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk)
*  And then we just heard from the speaker of the house. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=0.0s)]
*  Please remain standing for the honors and the invocation. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=20.28s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, escorting the vice president of the United States, ranking member of the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=24.76s)]
*  on inaugural ceremonies, the honorable Deb Fisher and Mr. Fisher. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=40.84s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, the vice president of the United States, the honorable J.D. Vance, accompanied by Mrs. Vance. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=57.52s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, escorting the president of the United States, the chairwoman of the joint congressional committee on inaugural ceremonies, the honorable Amy Klobuchar and Mr. Bessler. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=87.52s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States, the honorable Donald John Trump and Mrs. Trump. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=117.52s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, the vice president of the United States, the chairwoman of the joint congressional committee on inaugural ceremonies, the honorable J.D. Vance. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=147.52s)]
*  I have a feeling people are very hungry, so I'm going to get this started. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=177.52s)]
*  Mr. President and Madam First Lady, Mr. Vice President and Madam Second Lady, my colleague Senator Fisher, distinguished guests including the speaker, leader Jeffries and Senate leaders Thune and Schumer. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=205.52s)]
*  On behalf of the United States Congress, welcome to the 60th inaugural lunch. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=220.52s)]
*  Big surprise, we are featuring Nebraska beef and Minnesota apples for dessert. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=225.52s)]
*  We are here in Statuary Hall where these luncheons have taken place since President Reagan's first inauguration in 1981 and where the House of Representatives once met over 150 years ago. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=231.52s)]
*  That would be before you were born, Mr. Speaker. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=247.52s)]
*  In 1864 after the new house wing of the Capitol was built and in the midst of the Civil War, Congress dedicated this chamber to host statues chosen by every state. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=251.52s)]
*  Walking into the hall, we all passed under the arch holding the marble Car of History clock. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=263.52s)]
*  The statue shows Cleo the Greek muse of history holding a book to record events as they happen. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=270.52s)]
*  And as you can see, she's heard a lot of stuff. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=276.52s)]
*  And as she rides her chariot forward into the future, she looks behind her to remember the past. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=279.52s)]
*  She remains here as she has for hundreds of years, a reminder that history will remember the events of the present and it is on us to write that history right now. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=286.52s)]
*  Speaking of art, the painting right here before you. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=298.52s)]
*  I chose this painting for this lunch this summer and it's titled American Horizon. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=302.52s)]
*  It's by Jane Wilson who grew up on her family farm in Seymour, Iowa. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=308.52s)]
*  Coming from the middle of our country, Senator Fischer and I both like the painting because the artist is from America's heartland, but the horizon could easily be Florida, Mr. President. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=313.52s)]
*  I will also note that this is the first time in history we are featuring the work of a woman artist. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=325.52s)]
*  And we thank the Art Institute of Chicago for their assistance. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=331.52s)]
*  Looking at the vast open landscape of this painting, we're drawn to the bottom of the frame where the land or the water, depending on where you're from, meets the sky and the horizon endures. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=337.52s)]
*  The enduring horizon is especially meaningful for us today as we mark our enduring democracy as we approach its 250th anniversary. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=349.52s)]
*  It's a reminder that what's over the horizon is our next chapter and it is my prayer that the people in this room can write that chapter together. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=358.52s)]
*  I'd now like to ask U.S. Senate Chaplain Dr. Barry Black, and we thank God he is back with us and in good health, to deliver the invocation after which lunch will be served. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=369.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=382.52s)]
*  Let us pray. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=388.52s)]
*  King of kings and Lord of lords, whose kingdom is above all earthly kingdoms and who judges all lesser sovereignties, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=393.52s)]
*  look with favor upon President Donald John Trump and Vice President James David Vance. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=408.52s)]
*  Empower them with the wisdom and courage needed for our times. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=420.52s)]
*  Protect them from the vicissitudes and challenges that obstruct the making of a world of justice, peace, and righteousness. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=430.52s)]
*  Lord, give them a deep desire to do their best for our country and world and a determination to act in ways pleasing to you. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=446.52s)]
*  Preserve their families in health and strength by your grace and power. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=461.52s)]
*  Bless now this luncheon as each of us finds your grace sufficient for every need. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=469.52s)]
*  We pray in your sovereign name. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=481.52s)]
*  Amen. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=486.52s)]
*  And thus begins the long-awaited Senate luncheon, which has been slightly delayed in part because of the number of extra speeches and more. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnWF3d8ilk&t=496.52s)]
