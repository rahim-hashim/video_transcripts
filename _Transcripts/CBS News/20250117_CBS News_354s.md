# Photographer unpacks his powerful images of Los Angeles fires
**CBS News:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs)
*  Welcome back. As you've no doubt taken notice, firefighters in Southern California, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=0.0s)]
*  thanks to the diminishing, raging Santa Ana winds, have been making steady, though agonizing, progress [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=4.88s)]
*  containing or attempting to contain wildfires around the Los Angeles area that have killed 27 people [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  and destroyed more than 12,000 structures. Here's just some of the damage we are seeing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  These photographs were taken by photographer Stuart Haley, who has been photographing wildfires [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=24.4s)]
*  for the better part of a decade. He joins us now. Stuart is also the author, I'm proud to say, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=30.96s)]
*  of The Inferno, a photographer's journey through California's mega fires and fallout. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=36.32s)]
*  Stuart, it's great to have you with us. As a native of Southern California, this story [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=43.84s)]
*  hits me pretty hard. And I have many friends who've had to evacuate. Fortunately, their [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=48.96s)]
*  structures haven't been burned to the ground, but many of their friends' structures, residences, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=55.2s)]
*  apartments have. And what they keep telling me via text and email is no photograph properly [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=59.92s)]
*  conveys the magnitude of what's happened. Has that been your experience? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=67.92s)]
*  I completely agree with that. The toughest message to get across is photographing 150 [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=72.24s)]
*  fires over 10 years, even being on the ground taking thousands of photos over the last week. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=78.32s)]
*  It's just hard to get across the scale of the destruction and devastation, the thousands of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=83.2s)]
*  structures lost, the tens of thousands of people who will be displaced for years on end. Your [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=88.0s)]
*  assessment of that is spot on. It's just an absolute tragedy and a humanitarian crisis. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  And Stuart, were you doing this as it was happening? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=98.48s)]
*  Yes, that's correct. So I was actually at the Eaton Fire in Altadena photographing that hours [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=102.72s)]
*  after the fire started. And as the fire came through into the town, I remember getting off [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  the freeway and having small spot fires in the mulch off of the freeway in Altadena. It was fire [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=112.4s)]
*  behavior like I'd never seen in my career. We had a hurricane force wind gusts of over 80 miles an [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=118.16s)]
*  hour in some areas. And Stuart, explain to the audience in your own words how difficult, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=123.28s)]
*  if not impossible, that makes it for firefighters arrayed to respond in a situation like that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=129.04s)]
*  Of course, when you have winds that strong, you have embers creating spot fires, one, two, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=136.24s)]
*  even some cases three miles out front of the fire. And when it's moving that fast, all you can do is [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=141.28s)]
*  get people out of the way and try and save lives. At that point, saving structures becomes the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=146.16s)]
*  priority after you've gotten people out of harm's way. And my heart breaks for every single person [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=150.88s)]
*  that lost their lives in this fire, who lost their homes and first responders saved so many lives [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=155.6s)]
*  getting people out of harm's way, getting them out of hospital beds, people who were in nursing homes. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=161.92s)]
*  So there were so many great saves done here. And I've seen a lot of criticism of the response, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=166.32s)]
*  but I have to say that being there and obviously you can see from my photos there, we were fighting [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=171.28s)]
*  against physics and a fire that did not stop until the wind stopped. And all we could do is get people [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=175.68s)]
*  out of the way. And then firefighters came back in and protected homes as best they could. Stewart, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=180.48s)]
*  did you have any moment where you were afraid for your physical safety? I am fortunate to have a [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=185.2s)]
*  little bit of wildfire training. And so it took all of my expertise and knowledge and past fire [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=192.39999999999998s)]
*  experiences to be safe. But there were certainly factors that were concerning to me. We had tree [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=198.0s)]
*  branches six feet tall from palm trees flying in through the air, stop signs of thin sheet metal [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=203.04s)]
*  flying through the air that if they hit somebody could cause serious injuries. So certainly there [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=208.4s)]
*  was a little bit of concern in the back of my mind to stay aware of the surroundings and what was [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  going on and be safe. Because my priority is to tell pictures and more importantly to be safe, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=217.52s)]
*  because I want to stay out of the way of first responders and document them doing their job and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=221.76s)]
*  not become a liability to them. And the audience may have gleaned this, but I want to make sure [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  they understand sometimes you are actually embedded with first responders. So you're right near them, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=230.88s)]
*  not right alongside them, but near them with this fire and the velocity, the enormity. What was their [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=236.48s)]
*  experience? What did you see in their eyes or their reaction to what they were up against? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=243.12s)]
*  Firefighters are typically to the point and straightforward. And I had multiple fire veterans [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=249.6s)]
*  who've been in the fire service in the Los Angeles area for over 30 years that are getting close to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=255.44s)]
*  retirement. Tell me that this is the most extreme fire behavior they've seen. And remember, we're [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=259.52s)]
*  January right now. Fire season is year round in California, but typically we've had wetting [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=264.8s)]
*  rains and the fuels are still so dry and we have potential winds in the future. So while fire crews [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=269.68s)]
*  are getting a break right now, we do have more winds in the forecast. So it's still all hands on [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=274.72s)]
*  deck and there's concerns there. But again, firefighters are telling me this is some of the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=279.6s)]
*  most extreme fire behavior they witnessed in their careers. And these fires are within sight of [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=283.68s)]
*  downtown Los Angeles. And when you were there, did you experience a phenomenon where people were [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=288.16s)]
*  evacuating like around you, like moving past you as you were moving in or closer to the fires? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=294.56s)]
*  That's correct, especially at the Eden Fire in Alta Dena, the fire was moving so quickly. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=302.16s)]
*  Of course, I parked my vehicle out of the way and walked in on foot. So my truck wasn't in the way [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=306.8s)]
*  of anybody, but I was walking up the sidewalk and next to me, people were leaving the fire going out, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=310.88s)]
*  taking pictures as they left, FaceTiming their friends and family to make sure they got out. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=316.72s)]
*  And I will say again, first responders and emergency services did a great job of getting [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=321.44s)]
*  people out of the way. But with the fire spreading so fast, people were leaving as I was photographing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=325.6s)]
*  It was chaos, most certainly for a few hours. This is an event that will define California's [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=330.88s)]
*  near term future. It will define for the nation what wildfires can be at their most severe and [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=337.84s)]
*  damaging. Stuart Paley, you said you can't capture all of it, but the photographs we've seen capture [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=344.24s)]
*  a great deal of it and we're indebted. Thank you very much. Thank you. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M653i_EMs&t=349.44s)]
