# What happens next after judge blocks Trump order to cancel birthright citizenship
**CBS News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw)
*  The Trump administration is reportedly giving [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=0.0s)]
*  immigration and customs enforcement officials [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=2.5s)]
*  authority to quickly deport migrants [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=4.88s)]
*  who were allowed into the U.S. temporarily [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=7.24s)]
*  under Biden-era programs. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=9.58s)]
*  According to a memo obtained by the New York Times, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=11.58s)]
*  this move could impact more than a million people [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  who fled from Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Haiti, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  and potentially impact immigrants [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=20.42s)]
*  from Afghanistan and Ukraine. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=22.3s)]
*  Meantime, as we mentioned earlier, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=24.26s)]
*  a federal judge temporarily blocked [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=26.1s)]
*  Trump's executive order, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=28.4s)]
*  attempting to end birthright citizenship in the U.S. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  The judge put in place a 14-day restraining order. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=33.1s)]
*  The Justice Department also responded, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=37.36s)]
*  saying in part, quote, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=39.18s)]
*  "'It will vigorously defend President Trump's EO, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=40.379999999999995s)]
*  "'which correctly interprets the 14th Amendment [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=43.7s)]
*  "'of the Constitution.'" [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=46.58s)]
*  That's a direct quote there. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=47.82s)]
*  CBS News immigration and politics reporter [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=49.32s)]
*  Camilo Montoya-Galvez joins us now with more on this. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=51.32s)]
*  Camilo, this is significant. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=55.06s)]
*  What might the next steps be in this case? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=56.64s)]
*  We're wondering if it will get to the Supreme Court. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  Good morning, Errol. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=62.32s)]
*  The federal judge in Seattle who denounced this bid [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=63.66s)]
*  by President Trump to upend the longstanding interpretation [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=65.96s)]
*  of the Constitution by trying to deny birthright citizenship [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=68.86s)]
*  to certain children who are born here [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=72.46s)]
*  really delivered an early setback [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=75.24s)]
*  for the Trump administration's immigration agenda, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=77.1s)]
*  but this will not be the final say in this legal battle [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=79.74s)]
*  under the Trump administration. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=84.3s)]
*  We know that this ruling, as you underscored, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=86.0s)]
*  is temporary in nature, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  and the judge in Seattle still has to adjudicate a request [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=90.18s)]
*  for a more permanent block on this bid by President Trump [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=93.74000000000001s)]
*  to upend birthright citizenship. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  So that case has still to be adjudicated. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=99.46000000000001s)]
*  But if there's any indication that the judge will side [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=103.36s)]
*  with Democratic-led states, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=108.16s)]
*  that is likely to be the outcome, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  given his strong rhetoric against the order [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=111.26s)]
*  in that hearing today, yesterday rather. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=114.52s)]
*  But it is really important to note that for now, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=117.92s)]
*  the federal agencies that were instructed, Errol, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=120.4s)]
*  to deny birthright citizenship to the children of parents [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=122.86s)]
*  who are in the country illegally, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=126.74s)]
*  as well as those who are here on temporary visas, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=128.2s)]
*  are now blocked from enforcing that guidance. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=130.54s)]
*  So for now, that attempt to upend the longstanding [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=133.04s)]
*  interpretation of the Constitution has been halted. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=136.54s)]
*  Wow. So what then is the status of the mass deportations [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=139.48s)]
*  Trump has been promising? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=143.58s)]
*  Where in the country might this be happening? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=144.82s)]
*  Well, of course, President Donald Trump made this promise [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=147.18s)]
*  of carrying out the largest deportation [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=150.08s)]
*  in American history, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=152.06s)]
*  a central pillar to his campaign for president, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=153.36s)]
*  and he is saying that that operation [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=156.32s)]
*  will indeed be carried out. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=159.1s)]
*  We have seen an uptick, Errol, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=160.86s)]
*  in ICE enforcement operations across the country, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=162.56s)]
*  including in cities with so-called sanctuary policies [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=165.94s)]
*  that limit cooperation with federal deportation agents, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=169.18s)]
*  but they appear to be, for the most part, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=172.60000000000002s)]
*  routine operations, Errol, so far, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=174.9s)]
*  that target migrants who are in the country illegally [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  but who also have criminal histories. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=180.08s)]
*  The big change now here from a policy perspective, Errol, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=182.24s)]
*  is that ICE agents during these operations [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=185.74s)]
*  can now arrest people who are non-criminals, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=188.28s)]
*  who are not the targets of these operations [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=191.42000000000002s)]
*  but who are otherwise in the country illegally. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=193.36s)]
*  So these are known as collateral arrests. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=196.06s)]
*  They can now happen during these operations. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=198.06s)]
*  That is a major shift in policy [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=200.58s)]
*  because the Biden administration [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=203.14000000000001s)]
*  had generally limited immigration enforcement [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=204.38s)]
*  to serious criminals, national security threats, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=207.02s)]
*  and people who recently were crossing [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=209.86s)]
*  the US-Mexico border. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=211.96s)]
*  And finally, ICE can also now go into schools and churches [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=213.46s)]
*  to arrest certain unauthorized immigrants [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=217.62s)]
*  because the Trump administration ended [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=220.3s)]
*  what the Biden administration called a prohibition [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=222.76s)]
*  on arrests in so-called sensitive locations, Errol. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=225.3s)]
*  All right, a comprehensive review [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=227.88s)]
*  of all that's happening on that front. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  Camila Montoya-Galvez, thanks so much. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=230.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=233.16s)]
*  And we have this detail for you. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=234.0s)]
*  ICE confirms its agents conducted a, quote, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=235.44s)]
*  targeted enforcement operation, end quote, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=238.68s)]
*  at a work site in Newark, New Jersey. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=241.24s)]
*  Surveillance video shows what appears [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=243.6s)]
*  to be federal immigration agents taking a man into custody [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=245.36s)]
*  outside the Ocean Seafood Depot. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=249.44s)]
*  The owner says agents arrived yesterday unannounced [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=252.18s)]
*  and asked to see documentation of his employees. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=255.0s)]
*  He tells CBS News New York's Ali Bauman [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=258.34s)]
*  three people were taken into custody. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=260.74s)]
*  They didn't have a court order or, I mean, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=263.98s)]
*  I didn't even ask. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=266.34s)]
*  26 years in business, I've never seen anything like this. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=267.5s)]
*  Newark's mayor says ICE's actions here [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=271.02s)]
*  were in violation of the Fourth Amendment. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=273.38s)]
*  He claims one of the detainees is a US military veteran. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmfam2h1ggw&t=275.78s)]
