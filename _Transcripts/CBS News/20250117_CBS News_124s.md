# Los Angeles area crews make progress containing wildfires
**CBS News:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQD7-G5DRoA)
*  Subsiding winds in the Los Angeles area have allowed fire crews to gain more control of the ongoing wildfires. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQD7-G5DRoA&t=0.0s)]
*  As of Friday evening, the Palisades fire is 31% contained, the Eden fire is 65% contained, and further west of Ventura County, the Otto fire is 85% contained. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQD7-G5DRoA&t=9.0s)]
*  Go ahead and take a look at this. This is drone footage from Malibu. It really gives you an idea of how much damage these fires have caused. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQD7-G5DRoA&t=20.0s)]
*  Crews are now working to locate 31 missing people and assess the damage. CBS News reporter Andres Gutierrez has the latest on the conditions to expect this weekend. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQD7-G5DRoA&t=28.0s)]
*  So another round of Santa Ana winds are expected to sweep through the area next week. The National Weather Service is saying that next week is a concern. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQD7-G5DRoA&t=38.0s)]
*  They're confident that they will not have a repeat of last week, but dangerous fire conditions are expected. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQD7-G5DRoA&t=45.0s)]
*  That's driven by the fact that there is no rain in the immediate short term forecast and there hasn't been any measurable rainfall in the last eight months. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQD7-G5DRoA&t=50.0s)]
*  So any dry brush or vegetation can act as fuel if a fire were to spark. But on the flip side, if there is so much rainfall, it could end up over exceeding the drainage system here in the city of Los Angeles. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQD7-G5DRoA&t=58.0s)]
*  And that could send debris to overflow and also landslides are a possibility if there is a lot of rain in the forecast. If it happens, some areas affected by the Palisades fire have had their evacuations orders lifted. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQD7-G5DRoA&t=71.0s)]
*  Those mostly in the northern and eastern edges of the fire zone where we're at right now, it'll be at least another week. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQD7-G5DRoA&t=85.0s)]
*  This says repair crews are right now working on the infrastructure and there's also an assessment of damage that is happening as well as EPA crews that are going around trying to figure out what hazardous materials were are that they have to clean up. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQD7-G5DRoA&t=92.0s)]
*  Search and rescue operations are also underway. So access does remain limited in those areas where officials believe that there may be missing persons cases in those areas. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQD7-G5DRoA&t=107.0s)]
*  I'm Andres Gutierrez in Los Angeles. Back to you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQD7-G5DRoA&t=119.0s)]
*  Andres Gutierrez, thank you. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQD7-G5DRoA&t=122.0s)]
