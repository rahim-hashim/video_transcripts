# Details on Chinese retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products set to take effect next week
**CBS News:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY)
*  All right, China is fighting back against the Trump administration's tariffs on Chinese [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=0.0s)]
*  products. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=4.3s)]
*  Beijing is planning the slap tariffs on multiple U.S. imports. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=5.3s)]
*  The move is mirroring that trade war between the United States and China, which happened [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=8.74s)]
*  back in 2018, which could cause a ripple effect on the U.S. economy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=12.48s)]
*  Now, this comes almost less than 24 hours after the United States paused its tariffs [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=16.22s)]
*  that it had planned to impose on Canada and Mexico. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=21.88s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News' Money Watch correspondent, Kelly O'Grady, to break this all down for [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=25.14s)]
*  us. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=28.48s)]
*  Let's begin first with China. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=29.68s)]
*  It's interesting, and I think we were talking about this on CBS Mornings yesterday, that [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=31.6s)]
*  the United States had planned to put higher tariffs on our allies, Canada, Mexico, and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=35.8s)]
*  lower tariffs on China. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=40.7s)]
*  Meanwhile, he just rescinded, or at least he paused, those tariffs on our allies. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=42.36s)]
*  He kept the tariffs in place in China. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=46.1s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=47.56s)]
*  Yeah, fast-moving situation. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=48.56s)]
*  So I think what's interesting is he placed a 10 percent tariff on all Chinese imports. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=50.28s)]
*  That's much less than the 60 percent or the 100 percent that he had at one point threatened, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=55.5s)]
*  and as you said, much less than 25 percent. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=59.58s)]
*  What China did in response is a little bit muted, and I really want to emphasize that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=62.14s)]
*  They put a 15 percent tariff on liquefied natural gas and coal, a 10 percent tariff [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=66.44s)]
*  on crude oil, farming equipment, and cars coming from the U.S. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=71.62s)]
*  That's not a ton that they import from us, okay? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=76.26s)]
*  They get much more of those types of products from Russia, from Indonesia. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=79.18s)]
*  Also, the U.S. doesn't export a ton of those products to China. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=83.74s)]
*  So it was sort of a little bit of a tariff versus what we could have done on China, and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=88.86s)]
*  then China's response was a bit muted. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=94.94s)]
*  Now in terms of what you're going to see in terms of prices in the U.S., you're not going [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=97.14s)]
*  to see a full 10 percent increase when you go to the store and you buy a toy that came [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=100.66s)]
*  from China, because that 10 percent tax, import tax, is paid by the company, but it's on a [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=104.96s)]
*  wholesale price. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=110.66s)]
*  And then they can decide if they're going to pass all of that on to you. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=111.66s)]
*  So it's not going to see, if you buy a $100 item, a $110 price tag for you. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=114.86s)]
*  It's going to be a little bit less. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=121.06s)]
*  But what I find interesting, Vlad, is this was tit for tat, but it was definitely muted [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  on both sides. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=127.56s)]
*  So it almost feels as if China is like, this is Sparta. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=128.56s)]
*  Like you're not going to threaten me to get that reference, right? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=131.85999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=134.62s)]
*  It's like a pop culture reference. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=135.62s)]
*  I'm a pop culture nerd. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=136.62s)]
*  But it almost feels as if they're like, look, go ahead and do it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=137.62s)]
*  We're fine. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=141.0s)]
*  We're not going to be affected by this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=142.0s)]
*  If you keep coming at us, we will find more creative ways to come after the United States. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=144.2s)]
*  Potentially. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=148.92s)]
*  Though the other aspect is I want to remind us all where China's economy is right now. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=149.92s)]
*  They're not doing so great after the pandemic. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=154.96s)]
*  They didn't have as much of a resurgence as the U.S. did. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=158.08s)]
*  So they also want to be careful that they they want to signal to the U.S. this is Sparta, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=161.36s)]
*  but they also don't want to hurt their economy too much. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=165.56s)]
*  And I want to note they didn't put import taxes on key rare minerals and whatnot that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=167.92s)]
*  they need for their semiconductor industry. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=174.48s)]
*  Remember, they want to build high powered chips and they don't want to hamstring them. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=176.6s)]
*  So it was, yes, I'm signaling, don't come at us. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=181.0s)]
*  But I also don't want to hurt my economy that is in a little bit of a tough place right [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=183.89999999999998s)]
*  now. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=187.39999999999998s)]
*  It's really kind of fascinating when you think about it on a geopolitical level, because [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  as we're talking about it, it sort of signals that China is calling President Trump's bluff. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=191.67999999999998s)]
*  You can try to do this. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=196.61999999999998s)]
*  It may look good back home. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=197.66s)]
*  It doesn't really affect us at the levels that you expect that it will affect us. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=198.82s)]
*  And remember, as we've been pointing out to our viewers, any tariffs are imposed on another [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=203.22s)]
*  country are paid by the country where those goods are coming into, which would be the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  United States. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=212.22s)]
*  So it'll be really interesting to see how it all like sort of plays out over the next [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=213.62s)]
*  couple of weeks. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=217.02s)]
*  And if President Trump decides to increase the level of tax, the level of tariffs on [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=218.02s)]
*  China. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=221.78s)]
*  Really fascinating discussion, Kelly. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=222.86s)]
*  Always great to have you here in the studio. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=224.26s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=225.26s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QFnpcm9KY&t=226.26s)]
