# Trump says he may impose reciprocal tariffs on Canadian lumber, dairy
**CBS News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw)
*  Tonight on America Decides, the Friday roundup, President Trump gathers reporters in the Oval [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=0.0s)]
*  Office and gives wide-ranging remarks on Doge's efforts to cut federal workers, on eliminating [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=5.5s)]
*  the Department of Education, and on working with Ukraine, as the two countries give diplomacy [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=11.44s)]
*  another try. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=18.2s)]
*  We had too many people in government. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=21.96s)]
*  You can't just do that. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  We had many, many, too many. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=25.1s)]
*  We want the education to be given by the states. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=26.64s)]
*  It'll be much better. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=30.12s)]
*  It'll be, it'll move us to the top of the list from the bottom of the list. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=31.12s)]
*  We're doing very well with Russia. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=34.96s)]
*  But right now they're bombing the hell out of Ukraine and Ukraine. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=38.16s)]
*  I'm finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=41.56s)]
*  And they don't have the cards. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=45.92s)]
*  Tariff turmoil. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  Just a day after the president pulled back tariffs on Canada and Mexico, a new trade [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  tax warning. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=55.76s)]
*  How he could soon roll out a tax on dairy and lumber that's coming over the northern [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=57.12s)]
*  border. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=62.44s)]
*  All that plus a new consideration to hit Russia with large-scale sanctions over its war on [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=63.72s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=69.84s)]
*  But let's start tonight with our political director, Finn Gomez, and Congressional correspondent [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  Caitlin Huey-Burns to talk about all of that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=75.32s)]
*  Happy Friday. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=78.12s)]
*  Good to see you guys in person. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=79.12s)]
*  You made it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=80.12s)]
*  So it's been a busy week. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=81.12s)]
*  Lots of twists and turns, particularly when it comes to tariffs, where the president's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=83.39999999999999s)]
*  policies seem to change by the day. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  Today was no exception. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=89.8s)]
*  Take a look at what he said about tariffs on Canada. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=91.52s)]
*  Canada has been ripping us off for years on tariffs for lumber and for dairy products. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=95.28s)]
*  250 percent, nobody ever talks about that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=101.24s)]
*  250 percent tariff, which is taking advantage of our farmers. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=104.91999999999999s)]
*  So that's not going to happen anymore. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=109.63999999999999s)]
*  He went on to say that he's going to impose a 250 percent dairy tariff on Canada in the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=112.24s)]
*  coming days. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  Who knows if that is actually going to come to pass. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  What's the strategy here, Finn? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  Is there a strategy? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  You know, Nancy, I think whipsaw is my new favorite word of the week because that's exactly [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=125.47999999999999s)]
*  how it feels like. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=129.64s)]
*  This week has been— [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=130.64s)]
*  Last week was chainsaw, this week is whipsaw. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=131.64s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=134.04s)]
*  Yes, Nancy. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=135.04s)]
*  But look, I asked the White House about this earlier today and essentially they believe [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  that this is the best efforts for him to really get what he thinks is best for the U.S. economy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=143.48s)]
*  He thinks ultimately that he believes in this and it's ultimately a strategy that he thinks [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  will be best for the American economy. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  I did also speak to a former senior administration official about this specifically, someone [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  who's been in the room with him, and he told me specifically that he truly believes in this. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=165.72s)]
*  There's no ulterior strategy here. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=170.12s)]
*  So then why does he keep rolling it back as soon as he does it? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=173.16s)]
*  It's in part because he says that, you know, it's something that he's—and I quote, he [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=175.96s)]
*  said often that he believes that everybody wants to be in our—everybody wants our markets, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=182.76s)]
*  everybody wants to be and have access to our markets. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=189.32s)]
*  Before, in Trump 1.0, he had people who stood up and had different opinions on trade policy. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=193.39999999999998s)]
*  And here this time around, you really have people who believe in this protectionist perspective. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  And ultimately, they do believe that he thinks there's a method to this madness. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=203.83999999999997s)]
*  There is a strategy behind here that will ultimately benefit the United States. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=210.39999999999998s)]
*  But right now, this whipsaw is really the key word of what we can see. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=214.16s)]
*  He thinks it's leverage to help him extract things from other countries. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=219.52s)]
*  But Republicans, not so sure. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=223.44s)]
*  I mean, they towed the party line on a lot of issues. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=225.48000000000002s)]
*  But on this issue, they have been pretty vocal, some of them, about the fact that they don't [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=228.28s)]
*  think that this is a good idea. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=233.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=234.96s)]
*  I mean, the president likes to say that tariff is his favorite word in the dictionary. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=235.96s)]
*  Republicans on Capitol Hill do not share that sentiment. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=239.44s)]
*  And they have been—you're right, Nancy, very vocal about this, because a lot of them [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=241.94s)]
*  come from big agriculture states, big manufacturing states, even in North Carolina, lumber, furniture, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=245.96s)]
*  that kind of thing. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=253.16s)]
*  So they have been more vocal here. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=254.16s)]
*  Rand Paul gave an interesting quote this week saying, everybody in my state is coming up [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=257.08s)]
*  to me and saying, we don't like tariffs, we don't want them. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  But what's interesting here, and even John Thune, the Senate Majority Leader, says, look, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=266.88s)]
*  I don't share these views. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=270.76s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=272.32s)]
*  What's interesting is that they are willing to give him kind of latitude here because [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=273.32s)]
*  he keeps changing his mind. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=277.36s)]
*  And when you talk to Republicans about it, they say, look, this is what I think. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=279.44s)]
*  I'm trying to tell the president this or hint to him. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=283.0s)]
*  But we also know that he can pull them back when he wants to. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=285.68s)]
*  So they're giving him a lot of latitude here, even as they're raising their hands about [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=289.52s)]
*  it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=293.68s)]
*  We'll see how long the patience lasts. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=294.68s)]
*  And they have been hearing an earful, the White House has, from constituents, from Trump [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=295.68s)]
*  not just those lawmakers who have been, who are skittish and nervous about the impact [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  that these, that this tariff talks are happening. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=307.88s)]
*  And remember, this was a party that just, I will not remember a few years ago, this [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=310.84000000000003s)]
*  was a party that was free trade, was a major component of the Republican Party. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=316.36s)]
*  Now it's something completely different. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=321.32000000000005s)]
*  Finn, you've got some new reporting on the last administration and specifically Vice [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=322.88s)]
*  President Kamala Harris, who we've known for a while. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=327.68s)]
*  She was mulling a bid for California governor, but it's seemed to bubble back up into the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=331.40000000000003s)]
*  news today. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=337.8s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=338.8s)]
*  That's right, Nancy. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=339.8s)]
*  And our colleague, Weijia Jiang, and I have been reporting on this today that people close [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=340.8s)]
*  to former Vice President Harris tell us that she is strongly, strongly considering a run [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=345.20000000000005s)]
*  to be for governor of California. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=353.52000000000004s)]
*  We do know that Governor Newsom is now the current governor, but his term limited out. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=356.48s)]
*  She is considering this decision and will make her decision by the summertime. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=360.4s)]
*  Of course, all eyes are on her if she does do this. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=366.44s)]
*  There has been some recent polling that shows she is the front runner there. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=369.72s)]
*  And of course, though, however, politically, logistically, if you will, if she does run [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=372.72s)]
*  for governor, it does make a 2028 run really unlikely, I would say. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=377.38s)]
*  That is fascinating and interesting that she is now very seriously considering this. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=384.44s)]
*  Finn Gomez, Caitlin Huey-Burns, thanks so much. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  Have a great weekend, you guys. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=391.76s)]
*  Thanks, Nancy. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6adfo70Pmw&t=392.76s)]
