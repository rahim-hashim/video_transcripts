# Trump says he's "not confident" Israel-Hamas ceasefire will hold
**CBS News:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0)
*  We are now in the third day of the Gaza ceasefire while the deal was negotiated under President Joe Biden [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=0.0s)]
*  Implementation now falls on the Trump administration [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=6.34s)]
*  Yesterday the president was asked about the deal's longevity. Here's what he had to say [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=9.14s)]
*  How confident are you Mr. President that you can keep the ceasefire in Gaza and conclude the three phases of the deal? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=13.76s)]
*  I'm not confident. It's not our war, it's their war, but I'm not confident [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=20.759999999999998s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Remy Nascencio is live for us in Tel Aviv this morning [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=26.759999999999998s)]
*  So Remy, President Trump has overturned sanctions that came in under the Biden administration [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=32.76s)]
*  On far-right Israeli settler groups and individuals in the West Bank [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=38.76s)]
*  What does the decision indicate about Trump's stance towards the region and specifically how are folks reacting to what he said yesterday? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=44.26s)]
*  Sure, well people are [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=54.76s)]
*  Turning turning their heads in terms of what's what he's been saying because they have seen [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=57.26s)]
*  Donald Trump as someone who has been at least telegraphing very strong support [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=63.7s)]
*  Against what has been happening with the Biden administration [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=70.06s)]
*  But also looking at the the the raft of orders that he has written [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=73.4s)]
*  For example the one you just talked about rescinding the executive order under the Biden administration [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=79.2s)]
*  with regards to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=85.0s)]
*  Settlers in the West Bank and basically talking about undermining peace and security [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=86.64s)]
*  That is just one of many things here for example, Bezelos Motrik the finance minister cheered that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=91.2s)]
*  We spoke to a settler in one of those settlements a couple weeks ago [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=97.2s)]
*  And he was telling us that he was satisfied with President Trump in addition. He was quite excited about the incoming [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  Ambassador or at least have to be ambassador Mike Huckabee who has called himself an unapologetic Zionist, but also yesterday [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Trump [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=115.88s)]
*  Restored sanctions on the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=117.4s)]
*  International Criminal Court even as he took away sanctions on those West Bank settlers [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=119.84s)]
*  He the ICC had issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=125.68s)]
*  Accusing him of war crimes Israeli media also reporting that Trump will lift a Biden era ban on the supply of one ton bombs [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=129.8s)]
*  Trump also suspended all US foreign policy foreign aid for 90 days and that's expected to impact Palestinians in particular [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=138.16s)]
*  a [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=147.02s)]
*  Netanyahu has congratulated Trump on his return to the White House [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=148.34s)]
*  Do we know if the two are scheduled to speak or if the prime minister is scheduled to make a visit to the United States? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=151.62s)]
*  Sure no word yet on whether that is going to happen [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=160.34s)]
*  But in the initial minutes after Trump was sworn in Prime Minister Netanyahu here issued a video [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=164.34s)]
*  Congratulations to mr. Trump very effusive very excited and then he got down to business and he basically [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=172.82000000000002s)]
*  asked [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=181.22s)]
*  Said what he wanted in terms of trying to get back the rest of the hostages in Gaza [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=182.74s)]
*  He said specifically to destroy Hamas's military wing. He also [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=189.3s)]
*  rattled off the I guess the successes that happened during Trump's first term with regards to Israeli policy and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=194.34s)]
*  for example recognizing controversially the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=202.38000000000002s)]
*  the capital of Israel as Jerusalem and also for Arab countries are [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=206.02s)]
*  Recognizing and establishing diplomatic relations with Israel. The idea there is that potentially they could expand on that here [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  Thereby giving more stability to Israel in the region for the benefit Israel [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=218.26000000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of hope for change here among Israelis and including even Palestinians that we've talked to that even if they don't want Trump [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=222.98000000000002s)]
*  He brings a change that they might want [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  And I'm still trying to decipher what the president meant when he was asked about Gaza Remy [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=232.83999999999997s)]
*  Yesterday and said it's a phenomenal location on the sea the best weather beautiful things could be done with it some fantastic things [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=238.67999999999998s)]
*  Could be done with Gaza. I'm sure a lot of people were wondering exactly what that potentially means [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=245.72s)]
*  We'll have to wait and see Remy de Sencio for us in Tel Aviv as always my friend. Thank you very much. Stay safe [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhaMo6Ics-0&t=250.76s)]
