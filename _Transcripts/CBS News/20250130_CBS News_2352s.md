# Trump speaks about deadly midair D.C. plane crash, slams DEI and Biden | Special Report
**CBS News:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q)
*  CBS News special report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=0.0s)]
*  We're going to take you live right now to the Brady briefing room in the White House [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1.44s)]
*  where we just caught a glimpse of President Donald Trump. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=6.04s)]
*  We expect to hear his first remarks on this tragedy over the Potomac. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Let's listen in. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=13.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=26.06s)]
*  I speak to you this morning in an hour of anguish for our nation. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=32.94s)]
*  Just before 9 p.m. last night, an American Airlines regional jet carrying 60 passengers [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=39.18s)]
*  and four crew collided with an Army Blackhawk helicopter carrying three military service [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=44.58s)]
*  members over the Potomac River in Washington, D.C., while on final approach to Reagan National [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=50.4s)]
*  Airport. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=57.12s)]
*  Both aircraft crashed instantly and were immediately submerged into the icy waters [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=58.54s)]
*  of the Potomac. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=63.26s)]
*  Real tragedy. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=65.18s)]
*  The massive search and rescue mission was underway throughout the night, leveraging [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=66.9s)]
*  every asset at our disposal and I have to say the local, state, federal, military, including [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=71.5s)]
*  the United States Coast Guard in particular, they've done a phenomenal job. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=78.48s)]
*  So quick, so fast. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=83.46000000000001s)]
*  It was mobilized immediately. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=85.10000000000001s)]
*  The work has now shifted to a recovery mission. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=88.68s)]
*  Sadly, there are no survivors. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=93.64s)]
*  This was a dark and excruciating night in our nation's capital and in our nation's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  history and a tragedy of terrible proportions. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=102.2s)]
*  As one nation, we grieve for every precious soul that has been taken from us so suddenly [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=107.02s)]
*  and we are a country of really, we are in mourning. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=114.32s)]
*  This is really shaking a lot of people, including people very sadly from other nations who were [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=119.08s)]
*  on the flight. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=124.84s)]
*  For the family members back in Wichita, Kansas, here in Washington, D.C., and throughout [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=126.8s)]
*  the United States and in Russia. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=131.46s)]
*  We have a Russia contingent, some very talented people. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=135.26000000000002s)]
*  Unfortunately, we're on that plane. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=138.9s)]
*  Very, very, very sorry about that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=140.5s)]
*  Whose loved ones were aboard the passenger jet. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=143.02s)]
*  We can only begin to imagine the agony that you're all feeling. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=146.1s)]
*  Nothing worse. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=151.08s)]
*  On behalf of the First Lady, myself and 340 million Americans, our hearts are shattered [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=152.88s)]
*  alongside yours and our prayers are with you now. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=157.5s)]
*  And in the days to come, we'll be working very, very diligently in the days to come. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=161.28s)]
*  We're here for you to wipe away the tears and to offer you our devotion, our love, and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=166.06s)]
*  our support. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=171.02s)]
*  There's great support. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=172.02s)]
*  In moments like this, the differences between Americans fade to nothing compared to the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=174.12s)]
*  bonds of affection and loyalty that unite us all, both as Americans and even as nations. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=179.72s)]
*  We are one family, and today we are all heartbroken. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=186.56s)]
*  We're all searching for answers. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=190.24s)]
*  That icy, icy Potomac, that was a cold, cold night, cold water. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=192.52s)]
*  We're all overcome with the grief for many who have so tragically perished will no longer be with us. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=200.88s)]
*  Together we take solace in the knowledge that their journey ended not in the cold waters of the Potomac, but in the warm embrace of a loving God. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=207.6s)]
*  We do not know what led to this crash, but we have some very strong opinions and ideas. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=216.22s)]
*  And I think we'll probably state those opinions now. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=222.22s)]
*  Because over the years, I've watched as things like this happen and they say, well, we're always investigating. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=224.5s)]
*  And then the investigation three years later, they announce it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=230.9s)]
*  We think we have some pretty good ideas. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=233.54000000000002s)]
*  But we'll find out how this disaster occurred and we'll ensure that nothing like this ever happens again. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=236.82000000000002s)]
*  The FAA and the NTSB and the US military will be carrying out a systematic and comprehensive investigation. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=243.8s)]
*  Our new Secretary of Transportation, Sean Duffy, is second day on the job. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=251.48s)]
*  When that happened, it's a rough one. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=258.64s)]
*  We'll be working tirelessly. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=262.88s)]
*  He's a great gentleman. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=264.24s)]
*  A whole group is, these are great people. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=265.24s)]
*  And they are working tirelessly to figure out exactly what happened. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=268.52s)]
*  We will state certain opinions, however. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=273.5s)]
*  I'm also immediately appointing an acting commissioner to the FAA, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=275.42s)]
*  Christopher Rochelieu, a 22-year veteran of the agency, highly respected. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=280.26s)]
*  Christopher, thank you very much. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=287.54s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=289.02s)]
*  We must have only the highest standards for those who work in our aviation system. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=290.42s)]
*  I changed the Obama standards from very mediocre at best to extraordinary. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=294.38s)]
*  You remember that only the highest aptitude, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=301.47999999999996s)]
*  have to be the highest intellect and psychologically superior people, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=306.35999999999996s)]
*  were allowed to qualify for air traffic controllers. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  That was not so prior to getting there when I arrived in 2016. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=316.64s)]
*  I made that change very early on because I always felt this was a job that, and other jobs too, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=322.64s)]
*  this was a job that had to be superior intelligence. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=327.94s)]
*  And we didn't really have that and we had it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=331.42s)]
*  And then when I left office and Biden took over, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=335.86s)]
*  he changed them back to lower than ever before. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=339.7s)]
*  I put safety first. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=345.5s)]
*  Obama, Biden, and the Democrats put policy first. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=346.98s)]
*  And they put politics at a level that nobody's ever seen [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=350.62s)]
*  because this was the lowest level. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=357.4s)]
*  Their policy was horrible and their politics was even worse. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=359.52s)]
*  So as you know, last week, long before the crash, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  I signed an executive order restoring our highest standards for air traffic controllers [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=367.2s)]
*  and other important jobs throughout the country. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=372.68s)]
*  So it was very interesting. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=374.6s)]
*  About a week ago, almost upon entering office, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=376.36s)]
*  I signed something last week that was an executive order, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=382.41999999999996s)]
*  very powerful on restoring the highest standards of air traffic controllers and others, by the way. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=387.41999999999996s)]
*  Then my administration will set the highest possible bar for aviation safety. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=393.78s)]
*  We have to have our smartest people. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=397.94s)]
*  It doesn't matter what they look like, how they speak, who they are. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=400.34s)]
*  It matters intellect, talent, the word talent. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=404.17999999999995s)]
*  They have to be talented, naturally talented geniuses. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=408.02s)]
*  You can't have regular people doing that job. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=412.58s)]
*  They won't be able to do it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=414.53999999999996s)]
*  But we'll restore faith in American air travel. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=416.85999999999996s)]
*  I'll have more to say about that. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=419.21999999999997s)]
*  I do want to point out that various articles that appeared prior to my entering office. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=421.29999999999995s)]
*  And here's one. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=429.21999999999997s)]
*  The FAA's diversity push includes focus on hiring people [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=431.34s)]
*  with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=435.21999999999997s)]
*  That is amazing. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=441.17999999999995s)]
*  And then it says FAA says people with severe disabilities, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=442.73999999999995s)]
*  the most underrepresented segment of the workforce, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=446.53999999999996s)]
*  and they want them in and they want them. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=450.06s)]
*  They can be air traffic controllers. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=452.58s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=454.53999999999996s)]
*  This was in January 14th. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=455.94s)]
*  So that was a week before I entered office. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=459.06s)]
*  They put a big push to put diversity into the FAA's program. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=462.58s)]
*  Then another article, the Federal Aviation Administration. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=468.6s)]
*  This was before I got to office, recently second term. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=473.4s)]
*  The FAA is actively recruiting workers who suffer severe intellectual disabilities, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=479.84000000000003s)]
*  psychiatric problems, and other mental and physical conditions [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=486.8s)]
*  under a diversity and inclusion hiring initiative [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=490.08s)]
*  spelled out on the agency's website. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=492.92s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=495.85999999999996s)]
*  These are people that are, I mean, actually their lives are shortened [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=496.9s)]
*  because of the stress that they have. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=502.53999999999996s)]
*  Brilliant people have to be in those positions. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=506.73999999999995s)]
*  And their lives are actually shortened, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=509.9s)]
*  very substantially shortened because of the stress [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=511.62s)]
*  where you have many, many planes coming into one target. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=514.42s)]
*  And you need a very special talent and a very special genius to be able to do it. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=518.18s)]
*  Targeted disabilities are those disabilities [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=524.64s)]
*  that the federal government, as a matter of policy, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=527.04s)]
*  has identified for special emphasis in recruitment and hiring. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=529.4599999999999s)]
*  The FAA's website states they include hearing, vision, missing extremities, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=533.38s)]
*  partial paralysis, complete paralysis, epilepsy, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=540.2199999999999s)]
*  severe intellectual disability, psychiatric disability, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=543.64s)]
*  and dwarfism all qualify for the position of a controller of airplanes [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=547.8199999999999s)]
*  pouring into our country, pouring into a little spot, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=556.02s)]
*  a little dot on the map, a little runway. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=559.2199999999999s)]
*  The initiative is part of the FAA's diversity and inclusion hiring plan. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=563.5s)]
*  Think of that. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=567.9s)]
*  The initiative is part of the FAA's diversity and inclusion hiring plan, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=568.5s)]
*  which says diversity is integral to achieving FAA's mission [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=573.8s)]
*  of ensuring safe and efficient travel. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=577.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't think so. I don't think so. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=579.9599999999999s)]
*  I think it's just the opposite. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=581.56s)]
*  The FAA website shows that the agency's guidance on diversity hiring [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=583.8399999999999s)]
*  were last updated on March 23rd of 22. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=589.16s)]
*  They wanted to make it even more so. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=592.64s)]
*  And then I came in, and I assume maybe this is the reason. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=595.0s)]
*  The FAA, which is overseen by Secretary Pete Buttigieg, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=599.34s)]
*  a real winner, that's the guy, he's a real winner. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=605.4200000000001s)]
*  Do you know how badly everything's run [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=607.1s)]
*  since he's run the Department of Transportation? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=608.74s)]
*  He's a disaster. He was a disaster as a mayor. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=611.9000000000001s)]
*  He ran his city into the ground, and he's a disaster now. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=616.2600000000001s)]
*  He's just got a good line of bullshit. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=620.2600000000001s)]
*  The Department of Transportation, his government agency charge [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=623.7s)]
*  with regulating civil aviation. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=627.98s)]
*  Well, he runs it 45,000 people, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=629.8000000000001s)]
*  and he's run it right into the ground with his diversity. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=632.64s)]
*  So I had to say that it's terrible. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=636.52s)]
*  Then it's a group within the FAA, another story, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=640.48s)]
*  determined that the workforce was too white, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=644.2s)]
*  that they had concerted efforts [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=647.72s)]
*  to get the administration to change that [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=649.6800000000001s)]
*  and to change it immediately. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=654.04s)]
*  This was in the Obama administration [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=656.64s)]
*  just prior to my getting there. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=658.78s)]
*  And we took care of African Americans, Hispanic Americans. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=661.46s)]
*  We took care of everybody at levels [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=665.3s)]
*  that nobody's ever seen before. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=667.42s)]
*  It's one of the reasons I won. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=668.68s)]
*  But they actually came out with a directive, too white. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=670.9399999999999s)]
*  And we want the people that are competent. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=674.38s)]
*  But now we mourn and we pray, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=678.58s)]
*  and would like to ask all Americans to join me [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=680.3s)]
*  in a moment of silence as we ask God [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=683.46s)]
*  to watch over those who have lost their lives [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=685.46s)]
*  and bring comfort to the loved ones. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=687.58s)]
*  And I just want to say God bless everyone in this room. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=690.86s)]
*  This has been a terrible, very short period of time. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=694.58s)]
*  We'll get to the bottom of it. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=699.94s)]
*  So we all saw the same thing. We've seen it many times. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=702.0s)]
*  I've had the honor of hearing tapes. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=705.38s)]
*  Tapes are scary, very scary tapes. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=709.7800000000001s)]
*  And you had a airliner coming in, American Airlines. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=713.4s)]
*  He was doing everything right. He was on track. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=719.8s)]
*  He was the same track as everybody else that came in. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=722.4399999999999s)]
*  It's probably the same track [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=724.88s)]
*  as they've had for 25 years or more. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=726.3199999999999s)]
*  He's coming in the path. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=729.12s)]
*  And for some reason, he had a helicopter [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=731.48s)]
*  that was at the same height, obviously, when they hit, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=736.4399999999999s)]
*  but pretty much the same height. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=740.96s)]
*  And going at an angle that was unbelievably bad [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=743.48s)]
*  when the air traffic controller said, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=748.58s)]
*  Do you see? You know, he's talking about, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=752.1600000000001s)]
*  Do you see him? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=753.9200000000001s)]
*  But there was very little time left when that was stated. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=755.36s)]
*  And then also, he said, Follow him in. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=758.5600000000001s)]
*  And then almost immediately after that, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=761.0400000000001s)]
*  you know, seconds after that, there was the crash that took place. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=764.84s)]
*  Well, you follow him in. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=768.5999999999999s)]
*  That means like everything's fine, follow him in. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=769.88s)]
*  You had a pilot problem from the standpoint of the helicopter. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=774.88s)]
*  I mean, because it was visual. It was a very clear night. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=780.56s)]
*  It was cold, but clear and clear as you could be. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=784.76s)]
*  The American Airlines plane had lights blazing. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=789.52s)]
*  They had all their landing lights on. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=793.88s)]
*  I could see it from the Kennedy Center tape. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=796.1999999999999s)]
*  We had a tape up on the Kennedy Center. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=798.36s)]
*  That seems to be the primary. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=801.12s)]
*  That's why I'm sure we'll see other tapes, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=802.36s)]
*  because it's such an area where there are a lot of cameras, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=803.8000000000001s)]
*  a lot of cameras looking up into the air, into space. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=807.6800000000001s)]
*  So we'll probably see many other shots of it [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=812.0s)]
*  before too much time goes by. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=814.04s)]
*  But we had a situation where you had a helicopter [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=816.8000000000001s)]
*  that had the ability to stop. I have helicopters. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=822.88s)]
*  You can stop a helicopter very quickly. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=825.6800000000001s)]
*  It had the ability to go up or down. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=828.5600000000001s)]
*  It had the ability to turn. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=830.64s)]
*  And the turn it made was not the correct turn, obviously. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=834.2s)]
*  And it did somewhat the opposite of what it was told. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=839.12s)]
*  We don't know that that would have been the difference [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=843.32s)]
*  because the timing was so tight. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=844.92s)]
*  It was so — it was so little. There was so little time to think. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=846.88s)]
*  But what you did have is you had vision. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=851.64s)]
*  The helicopter had vision of the plane [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=854.6s)]
*  because you had vision of it all the way — [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=857.6s)]
*  perfect vision of it all the way from at Kennedy Center, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=859.2800000000001s)]
*  where the tape was taken. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=862.84s)]
*  And for some reason, there weren't adjustments made. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=865.32s)]
*  Again, you could have slowed down the helicopter substantially. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=868.52s)]
*  You could have stopped the helicopter. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=871.8000000000001s)]
*  You could have gone up. You could have gone down. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=873.1600000000001s)]
*  You could have gone straight up, straight down. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=874.9200000000001s)]
*  You could have turned. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=876.6800000000001s)]
*  You could have done a million different maneuvers. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=877.4000000000001s)]
*  For some reason, it just kept going [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=880.5600000000001s)]
*  and then made a slight turn at the very end. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=885.32s)]
*  And it was — by that time, it was too late. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=889.5600000000001s)]
*  They shouldn't have been at the same height [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=893.6s)]
*  because if it was at the same height, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=896.08s)]
*  you could have gone under it or over it, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=897.88s)]
*  and nobody realized — [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=899.72s)]
*  or they didn't say that it's at the same height. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=902.28s)]
*  At the same height, it would still wouldn't have been great, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=905.12s)]
*  but you would have missed it by quite a bit. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=907.6s)]
*  Could have been 1,000 feet higher. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=909.76s)]
*  It could have been 200 feet lower. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=911.12s)]
*  But it was exactly at the same height, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=913.5600000000001s)]
*  and somebody should have been able to point that out. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=915.1600000000001s)]
*  So all of this is going to be studied, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=917.84s)]
*  but it just seems to me from a couple of words [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=919.6800000000001s)]
*  that I like to use the words, common sense, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=923.52s)]
*  some really bad things happened [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=927.6800000000001s)]
*  and some things happened that shouldn't have happened. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=931.0s)]
*  So you had a helicopter going in identical direction. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=934.48s)]
*  You had a helicopter that was at the exact same height [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=939.36s)]
*  as somebody going in essentially the opposite direction. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=942.48s)]
*  You had a plane that was following a track, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=946.2800000000001s)]
*  which is a track that every other plane followed. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=948.12s)]
*  And I don't imagine — I know I've heard today [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=951.48s)]
*  that they might have been following the preceding plane, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=954.5200000000001s)]
*  which was pretty close, but not that close — [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=956.7600000000001s)]
*  the preceding plane. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=959.9200000000001s)]
*  But you wouldn't have even been able to see that [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=960.8800000000001s)]
*  because of the direction that the helicopter was coming in at. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=962.6800000000001s)]
*  So you had a confluence of bad decisions that were made. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=965.48s)]
*  And you have people that lost their lives — [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=972.6400000000001s)]
*  violently lost their lives. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=976.96s)]
*  We're going to take a few questions. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=980.72s)]
*  I'd like to ask our new Secretary of Transportation [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=982.12s)]
*  to say a few words. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=985.6400000000001s)]
*  Sean Duffy, great gentleman. Just started. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=986.5600000000001s)]
*  It's not your fault, and I know you agree with me [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=989.84s)]
*  very strongly on intellect [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=993.7600000000001s)]
*  and even psychological well-being [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=995.32s)]
*  of the air traffic control. It's such an important position. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=998.6400000000001s)]
*  And I think I can't emphasize stronger. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1002.1999999999999s)]
*  I changed it when I first ran, in 2016. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1004.6s)]
*  I changed it. We had the highest standard that you could have. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1008.84s)]
*  And then they changed it back. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1013.0s)]
*  That was Biden to a standard you just — [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1016.16s)]
*  I read it to you. That was from one of your papers. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1019.24s)]
*  One of the people in this room actually wrote that. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1022.3199999999999s)]
*  And then I changed it back a few days ago. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1026.2s)]
*  And unfortunately, that was — we'll see. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1028.52s)]
*  We don't know that necessarily it's even the controller's fault. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1035.8799999999999s)]
*  But one thing we do know, there was a lot of vision, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1039.0s)]
*  and people should have been able to see that, you know, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1041.12s)]
*  at what point do you stop? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1044.12s)]
*  At what point do you say, wow, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1045.24s)]
*  that plane is getting a little bit close? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1046.36s)]
*  So this is a tragedy that should not have happened. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1048.3999999999999s)]
*  Please, Sean. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1051.7199999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1053.8799999999999s)]
*  And I would just note the President's leadership [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1056.28s)]
*  has been remarkable during this crisis. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1059.6399999999999s)]
*  We have had a whole-of-government response — [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1062.32s)]
*  local, state, federal. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1064.84s)]
*  And when you see that kind of cooperation, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1067.04s)]
*  it begins with the leadership in this body. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1070.6s)]
*  So thank you for that, Mr. President. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1073.1599999999999s)]
*  You make our jobs a lot easier. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1074.52s)]
*  You made an important point that when we deal with safety, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1077.84s)]
*  we can only accept the best and the brightest [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1082.56s)]
*  in positions of safety [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1085.88s)]
*  that impact the lives of our loved ones, our family members. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1087.56s)]
*  And I think you make a really important point on that, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1091.6000000000001s)]
*  Mr. President. That is the motto of your presidency — [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1093.6000000000001s)]
*  the best and the brightest, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1096.64s)]
*  the most intelligent coming into these spaces. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1098.16s)]
*  I want to take a moment and extend my condolences [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1100.92s)]
*  to the families of the loved ones. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1104.08s)]
*  We commit to them that we are going to get [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1106.64s)]
*  to the bottom of this investigation, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1109.52s)]
*  not in three years, not in four years, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1112.04s)]
*  but as quickly as possible with the NTSB [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1113.76s)]
*  who is here today, as well as the FAA. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1116.52s)]
*  What happened yesterday shouldn't have happened. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1119.32s)]
*  It should not have happened. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1122.3600000000001s)]
*  And when Americans take off in airplanes, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1124.24s)]
*  they should expect to land at their destination. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1127.08s)]
*  That didn't happen yesterday. That's unacceptable. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1130.52s)]
*  And so we will not accept excuses. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1133.84s)]
*  We will not accept passing the buck. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1136.72s)]
*  We are going to take responsibility [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1141.04s)]
*  at the Department of Transportation and the FAA [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1143.28s)]
*  to make sure we have the reforms [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1145.84s)]
*  that have been dictated by President Trump in place [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1147.44s)]
*  to make sure that these mistakes do not happen again. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1150.52s)]
*  And again, I want to thank you for your leadership, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1153.52s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1155.24s)]
*  And I appreciate the confidence you placed in me. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1156.6000000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1160.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, thank you, Mr. President. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1167.72s)]
*  Again, I want to echo what the transportation secretary said [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1169.32s)]
*  about your leadership from the moment we found out about this. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1171.92s)]
*  We were in contact with the White House [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1175.4s)]
*  trying to determine exactly what happened. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1176.76s)]
*  I would echo it as well. No excuses. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1179.32s)]
*  We're going to get to the bottom of this. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1180.92s)]
*  We first and foremost from the Defense Department [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1184.4s)]
*  want to pass our condolences to the 64 souls [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1186.32s)]
*  and their families that were affected by this. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1189.96s)]
*  Never should happen. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1193.1200000000001s)]
*  And certainly the three service members, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1194.88s)]
*  the three soldiers, young captain, staff sergeant, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1196.3999999999999s)]
*  and CW2 chief warrant officer, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1200.9599999999998s)]
*  don a routine annual retraining of night flights [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1203.04s)]
*  on a standard corridor for a continuity of government mission. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1206.8s)]
*  The military does dangerous things. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1212.4399999999998s)]
*  It does routine things on the regular basis. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1213.9199999999998s)]
*  Tragically, last night, a mistake was made. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1216.9199999999998s)]
*  I think the President is right. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1219.52s)]
*  There was some sort of an elevation issue [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1221.6399999999999s)]
*  that we have immediately begun investigating [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1225.24s)]
*  at the DOD and Army level. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1227.04s)]
*  Army CID is on the ground investigating. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1229.1599999999999s)]
*  Top tier aviation assets inside the DOD are investigating, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1231.7199999999998s)]
*  sir, to get to the bottom of it so that it does not happen again [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1235.56s)]
*  because it's absolutely unacceptable. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1239.0s)]
*  But I want to echo what the transportation secretary [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1240.52s)]
*  and you, Mr. President, said, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1243.6399999999999s)]
*  because it pertains to the DOD as well. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1245.4799999999998s)]
*  We will have the best and brightest [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1248.1999999999998s)]
*  in every position possible. As you said in your inaugural, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1249.9199999999998s)]
*  it is colorblind and merit based. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1253.12s)]
*  The best leaders possible, whether it's flying blackhawks [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1256.8799999999999s)]
*  and flying airplanes, leading platoons or in government. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1259.8s)]
*  The era of DEI is gone at the Defense Department. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1264.12s)]
*  And we need the best and brightest, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1269.0s)]
*  whether it's in our air traffic control, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1270.1599999999999s)]
*  or whether it's in our generals, or whether it's throughout government. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1272.56s)]
*  So thank you for your leadership and courage on that, sir. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1275.8s)]
*  And we'll stand by you on it. Thank you very much. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1278.2399999999998s)]
*  Jay, do you have a question? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1280.92s)]
*  Well, thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1285.52s)]
*  I just want to reemphasize something the President said, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1287.8000000000002s)]
*  and you've heard from the Secretary of Transportation [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1289.96s)]
*  and of Defense, there really was a whole of government response. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1292.6000000000001s)]
*  We were all on the phone. We were all communicating yesterday, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1294.92s)]
*  trying to get to the bottom of this immediately, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1297.04s)]
*  but also try to communicate with the American people [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1299.16s)]
*  about what happened. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1301.76s)]
*  Something the President said that I think bears reemphasizing, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1303.3200000000002s)]
*  which is that when you don't have the best standards [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1306.76s)]
*  in who you're hiring, it means on the one hand, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1309.48s)]
*  you're not getting the best people in government, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1312.24s)]
*  but on the other hand, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1314.1200000000001s)]
*  it puts stresses on the people who are already there. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1315.28s)]
*  And I think that is a core part of what President Trump is going to bring [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1318.3600000000001s)]
*  and has already brought to Washington, D.C., [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1321.88s)]
*  is we want to hire the best people [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1324.24s)]
*  because we want the best people at air traffic control, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1326.3600000000001s)]
*  and we want to make sure we have enough people at air traffic control [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1328.64s)]
*  who are actually competent to do the job. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1331.76s)]
*  If you go back to just some of the headlines over the past 10 years, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1333.92s)]
*  you have many hundreds of people suing the government [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1336.96s)]
*  because they would like to be air traffic controllers, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1339.8000000000002s)]
*  but they were turned away because of the color of their skin. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1341.64s)]
*  That policy ends under Donald Trump's leadership [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1344.48s)]
*  because safety is the first priority of our aviation industry. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1346.92s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1350.28s)]
*  Mr. President, on DEI and the claims that you've made, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1351.88s)]
*  are you saying this crash was somehow caused [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1356.48s)]
*  and the result of diversity hiring? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1359.48s)]
*  And what evidence have you seen to support these claims? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1361.4s)]
*  It just could have been. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1364.68s)]
*  We have a high standard. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1365.8000000000002s)]
*  We've had a much higher standard than anybody else. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1367.0400000000002s)]
*  And there are things where you have to go by brain power, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1370.4s)]
*  you have to go by psychological quality. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1373.16s)]
*  And psychological quality is a very important element of it. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1377.76s)]
*  These are various very powerful tests that we put to use, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1381.0400000000002s)]
*  and they were terminated by Biden, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1384.0800000000002s)]
*  and Biden went by a standard that's the exact opposite. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1386.2s)]
*  So we don't know, but we do know that you had two planes at the same level. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1389.76s)]
*  You had a helicopter and a plane. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1393.64s)]
*  That shouldn't have happened. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1395.6000000000001s)]
*  And we'll see. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1397.0800000000002s)]
*  We're going to look into that, and we're going to see. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1398.2800000000002s)]
*  But certainly for an air traffic controller, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1399.8400000000001s)]
*  we want the brightest, the smartest, the sharpest. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1403.8000000000002s)]
*  We want somebody that's psychologically superior, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1406.24s)]
*  and that's what we're going to have. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1410.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1411.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, please, go ahead. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1414.0800000000002s)]
*  Mr. President, you mentioned at the top of the briefing [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1415.1200000000001s)]
*  that there were several Russian nationals on the flight. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1417.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1420.72s)]
*  Will the U.S. government be willing to facilitate [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1421.12s)]
*  the transfer of their remains, considering the fact [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1425.1599999999999s)]
*  there is no direct air travel between the two countries? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1428.52s)]
*  We've already been in contact with Russia, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1431.1599999999999s)]
*  and the answer is yes, we will facilitate. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1433.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1435.56s)]
*  Please, go ahead. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1438.32s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1439.08s)]
*  The situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is getting worse, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1442.12s)]
*  even though President John Lorenzo has been mediating the conflict [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1446.32s)]
*  between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1450.68s)]
*  because he wants to bring peace and stability. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1453.24s)]
*  The situation is really bad right now. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1456.1200000000001s)]
*  I want to hear from this president if you have any plan in the future [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1458.28s)]
*  to bring peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1462.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, there is going to be a question about Rwanda, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1463.5600000000002s)]
*  and it is a very serious problem. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1465.3200000000002s)]
*  I agree, but I don't think it's appropriate right now to talk about it. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1467.16s)]
*  But it is a very serious problem. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1469.92s)]
*  Mr. President, do you even yet know the names [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1471.3200000000002s)]
*  of the 67 people who were killed? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1473.88s)]
*  And you are blaming Democrats and DEI policies and air traffic control [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1475.8400000000001s)]
*  and seemingly the member of the U.S. military [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1480.32s)]
*  who was flying that Black Hawk helicopter. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1482.52s)]
*  Don't you think you're getting ahead of the investigation right now? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1484.36s)]
*  No, I don't think so at all. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1486.6s)]
*  I don't think with the names of the people. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1487.76s)]
*  You mean the names of the people that are on the plane? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1489.6399999999999s)]
*  You think that's going to make a difference? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1493.56s)]
*  They are a group of people that have lost their lives. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1494.9199999999998s)]
*  If you want a list of the names, we can give you that. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1499.1599999999999s)]
*  We'll be giving that very soon. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1501.36s)]
*  We're in coordination with American Airlines. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1502.72s)]
*  We're in coordination very strongly, obviously, with the military. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1505.0s)]
*  But I think that's not a very smart question. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1508.56s)]
*  I'm surprised coming from you. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1511.16s)]
*  Are you blaming the U.S. military? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1512.4s)]
*  Please. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1513.76s)]
*  Thank you, President Trump. Thank you for being here. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1514.8s)]
*  Based on your analysis so far, do you have a sense of who was at fault? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1517.2s)]
*  If it was the plane, the helicopter, air traffic control? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1521.28s)]
*  And can you assure people that it is safe to fly in and out of D.C.? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1524.2s)]
*  Well, I've given you the analysis, and the analysis was based on vision. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1528.04s)]
*  You had a lot of people that saw what was happening. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1535.2s)]
*  You had some people that knew what was happening. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1537.64s)]
*  There were some warnings, but the warnings were given very, very late. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1541.0s)]
*  You know, those warnings were given very late. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1543.96s)]
*  It was almost as they were given. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1545.76s)]
*  A few seconds later, there was a crash. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1547.8000000000002s)]
*  It should have been brought up earlier. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1550.5600000000002s)]
*  But the people in the helicopter should have seen where they were going. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1553.6000000000001s)]
*  I can't imagine people with 20-20 vision [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1559.5600000000002s)]
*  not seeing, you know, what's happening up there. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1564.36s)]
*  Again, they shouldn't have been at the same height. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1568.76s)]
*  You're going in reverse directions or sideways directions. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1571.36s)]
*  Obviously, you want to be at different heights. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1575.96s)]
*  I see it all the time when I'm flying. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1577.9199999999998s)]
*  You have planes going in the opposite. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1579.9199999999998s)]
*  They're always lower or higher. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1581.32s)]
*  So if somehow there's a screw-up, there's not going to be a tragedy. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1584.6399999999999s)]
*  It'll be close, but you know, there's never going to be a tragedy [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1589.2s)]
*  if you're at a different elevation. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1591.96s)]
*  For whatever reason, they were at the same elevation. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1593.72s)]
*  And also, from the American Airlines Center, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1596.8000000000002s)]
*  he's along the track that every plane is along. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1599.76s)]
*  You say, what was the helicopter doing in that track? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1603.92s)]
*  Very sad. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1607.68s)]
*  But visually, somebody should have been able to see [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1608.76s)]
*  and taken that helicopter at a play, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1611.48s)]
*  and they should have been at a different height. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1614.44s)]
*  The Press. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1617.44s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1618.44s)]
*  You mentioned the Russians that were on board that plane. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1619.44s)]
*  What other nationalities were on board that passing plane? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1622.28s)]
*  There were a couple of others. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1624.48s)]
*  We're going to be announcing it in about an hour. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1625.56s)]
*  We have some very specific information. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1627.3200000000002s)]
*  We're calling the countries. We've spoken to most of them. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1631.04s)]
*  But there were some other countries represented. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1633.44s)]
*  Mr. President, have you spoken to President Putin? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1635.6000000000001s)]
*  I have not, no. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1639.0800000000002s)]
*  Mr. President, on your executive order, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1640.28s)]
*  does the President question if I may? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1641.72s)]
*  On your executive order, you've already issued an executive order. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1643.24s)]
*  You say, well, restore aviation safety. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1645.24s)]
*  This crash happened after that. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1648.0s)]
*  Was the executive order successful? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1650.16s)]
*  And what more do you think can change and keep people safe? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1651.68s)]
*  Well, you know, we issued it three days ago, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1653.96s)]
*  and we're in the process of making those changes. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1656.28s)]
*  This is something that should have been done a long time ago. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1658.84s)]
*  Actually, my original order should have never been changed, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1664.1200000000001s)]
*  and I think maybe you wouldn't have had this problem. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1667.04s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1669.04s)]
*  Yeah, please. Go ahead. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1670.24s)]
*  Yes, thank you. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1671.68s)]
*  We see, like, everyday life that's very often [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1673.12s)]
*  that those diversity hires cause sometimes issues, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1675.52s)]
*  as you just mentioned. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1679.6s)]
*  So what plan do you have? Are we going to see some fire? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1681.08s)]
*  Are you going to fire some of those diversity hires [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1684.76s)]
*  in the federal government? What plan do you have? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1687.3999999999999s)]
*  I would say the answer is yes. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1690.12s)]
*  If we find that people aren't mentally competent, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1691.36s)]
*  you see the language. The language is put out by them. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1694.76s)]
*  And if you see that — [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1698.84s)]
*  I'm not going to bore you by reading it again, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1701.16s)]
*  but these are not people [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1703.24s)]
*  that should be doing this particular job. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1704.72s)]
*  They'd be very good for certain jobs, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1706.96s)]
*  but not people that should be doing this particular job. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1708.56s)]
*  Mr. President, you have today blamed the diversity elements, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1713.16s)]
*  but then told us that you weren't sure [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1717.84s)]
*  that the controllers made any mistake. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1721.0s)]
*  You then said perhaps the helicopter pilots [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1723.56s)]
*  were the ones who made the mistake. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1726.76s)]
*  It's all underinvestment. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1728.92s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1730.6000000000001s)]
*  That's why I'm trying to figure out [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1731.68s)]
*  how you can come to the conclusion right now [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1733.44s)]
*  that diversity had something to do with this crash. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1735.28s)]
*  Because I have common sense, okay? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1738.2s)]
*  And unfortunately, a lot of people don't. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1740.92s)]
*  We want brilliant people doing this. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1744.72s)]
*  This is a major chess game at the highest level. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1746.3600000000001s)]
*  When you have 60 planes coming in during a short period of time [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1749.8600000000001s)]
*  and they're all coming in different directions [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1754.2s)]
*  and you're dealing with very high-level computer — [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1756.42s)]
*  computer work and very complex computers. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1758.8s)]
*  And one of the other things I will tell you [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1763.28s)]
*  is that the systems that were built — [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1764.92s)]
*  I was going to rebuild the entire system, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1767.84s)]
*  and then we had an election [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1770.56s)]
*  that didn't turn out the way it should have. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1771.8s)]
*  But they didn't build the systems properly. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1774.08s)]
*  They spent a lot of money renovating a system, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1776.8s)]
*  spending much more money than they would have spent [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1779.24s)]
*  if they bought a new system for air traffic controllers, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1781.68s)]
*  meaning the computerized systems. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1784.1200000000001s)]
*  There are certain companies that do a very good job. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1786.92s)]
*  They didn't use those companies. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1789.44s)]
*  They used companies that should not have been doing it. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1790.7s)]
*  No, I think — I think this — [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1793.68s)]
*  I think it's very important to understand that for some jobs — [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1794.8400000000001s)]
*  and not only this, but air traffic controllers — [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1798.1200000000001s)]
*  they have to be at the highest level of genius. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1800.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1804.64s)]
*  I want to ask you about the ice skaters in a moment [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1805.8400000000001s)]
*  because the U.S. ice skating community was affected. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1809.3400000000001s)]
*  But first, if I can, the cited FAA tax that you read is real, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1811.2s)]
*  but the implication that this policy is new [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1814.84s)]
*  or that it stems from efforts that began under President Biden [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1816.84s)]
*  or the Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1819.6399999999999s)]
*  is demonstrably false. It's been on the FAA's website. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1822.24s)]
*  The President — [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1824.28s)]
*  The President — Who said that? You? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1825.28s)]
*  No, I'm — it's on the website. The FAA's website. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1826.28s)]
*  It was there in 2013. It was there for the entirety — [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1827.56s)]
*  Take that. What I read. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1829.1999999999998s)]
*  It was there for the entirety of your administration, too. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1830.32s)]
*  So my question is, why didn't you change the policy [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1832.6799999999998s)]
*  during your first administration? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1835.24s)]
*  I did change it. I changed the Obama policy. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1836.24s)]
*  And we had a very good policy. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1839.06s)]
*  And then Biden came in and he changed it. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1840.48s)]
*  And then, when I came in, two days, three days ago, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1843.0s)]
*  I signed a new order bringing it [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1845.64s)]
*  to the highest level of intelligence. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1847.4s)]
*  Okay. Please. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1849.64s)]
*  The Press. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1851.8400000000001s)]
*  The Press. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1853.44s)]
*  You mentioned that a vision was probably the problem [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1856.52s)]
*  that was at issue in this crash. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1860.3600000000001s)]
*  There's been some reports that one of the pilots [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1862.32s)]
*  in the helicopter may have been using night vision equipment. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1864.4s)]
*  Was there any indication? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1867.24s)]
*  The President. We don't know. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1868.3600000000001s)]
*  We're going to know that pretty soon. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1869.1200000000001s)]
*  It may change your view plane if you do have the night vision. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1871.28s)]
*  So it's very possible that could have happened. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1874.84s)]
*  That would be — that would be maybe a reason [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1877.92s)]
*  why you wouldn't actually see as well as on a clear night. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1880.0s)]
*  You can see sometimes better without it. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1883.56s)]
*  Have a couple more. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1885.52s)]

*  that little training that was done during that time? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1959.98s)]

*  You don't know. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1968.62s)]

*  You don't know, but the helicopter obviously was in the wrong place at the wrong time and [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1971.86s)]
*  a tragedy occurred. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1977.58s)]
*  Please. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1978.58s)]
*  I've got a question about the- [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1979.98s)]
*  No, go ahead. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1981.98s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1982.98s)]
*  You've been critical of the current regulations and you've called for big reforms at FAA. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1983.98s)]
*  I'm curious, sir, what is- [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1991.98s)]
*  Well, I made the reforms, actually. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1993.22s)]
*  What is your message- [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1994.86s)]
*  Three days ago, I made the reforms. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1995.86s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1996.86s)]
*  What is your message then to the American public in the weeks and months ahead? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1997.86s)]
*  Should they feel hesitant to fly? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=1999.6999999999998s)]
*  And if you could clarify perhaps something that the defense secretary said when he said [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2003.22s)]
*  that this helicopter was on a continuity of government mission? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2007.54s)]
*  I don't know what that refers to, but they were practicing. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2012.14s)]
*  They were. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2017.34s)]
*  They do that. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2018.34s)]
*  They call it practicing and they were. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2019.34s)]
*  And that's something that should be done. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2021.26s)]
*  It's only continuity in the sense that we want to have very good people and that has [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2024.46s)]
*  to be in continuity and that's what they refer to. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2028.02s)]
*  But it was basically practice and it was a practice that worked out very, very badly. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2032.14s)]
*  Okay? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2037.06s)]
*  The question about confidence about flying. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2038.06s)]
*  Mr. President, on his question, the first question, should people be hesitant to fly [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2040.5s)]
*  right now? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2047.06s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2048.06s)]
*  I do not hesitate to fly. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2049.06s)]
*  This is something that it's been many years that something like this has happened and [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2050.7799999999997s)]
*  the collision is just something that we don't expect ever to happen again. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2057.18s)]
*  We are going to have the highest level people we've already hired. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2062.2599999999998s)]
*  Some of the people that you've already hired for that position, long before we knew about [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2066.82s)]
*  this, I mean, long before, from the time I came in, we started going out and getting [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2070.6600000000003s)]
*  the best people because I said it's not appropriate what they're doing. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2075.26s)]
*  I think it's a tremendous mistake. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2079.54s)]
*  You know, they like to do things and they like to take them too far and this is sometimes [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2081.1400000000003s)]
*  what ends up happening. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2085.48s)]
*  Now with that, I'm not blaming the controller. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2086.48s)]
*  I'm saying there are things that you could question like the height of the helicopter [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2090.6600000000003s)]
*  or the height of the plane being at the same level and going in opposite directions. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2094.58s)]
*  It's not a positive, but no, we're already hiring people. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2098.02s)]
*  No, say flying is very safe. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2102.14s)]
*  We have the safest flying anywhere in the world and we'll keep it that way. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2103.7799999999997s)]
*  Thank you all very much. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2107.22s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2110.02s)]
*  You have been watching a fairly high wattage press conference there in the Brady briefing [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2116.98s)]
*  room with President Donald Trump, two cabinet secretaries and a brief appearance even from [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2123.28s)]
*  Vice President J.D. Vance. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2128.42s)]
*  The press conference began, as one might expect, with condolences and sorrow, words of comfort [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2130.78s)]
*  to the families of the 67 people believed to be dead at this hour after that midair [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2137.64s)]
*  collision. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2143.12s)]
*  And then the conversation turned, the president turned the conversation to what might have [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2144.58s)]
*  happened. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2149.28s)]
*  He called it a confluence of bad decisions. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2150.44s)]
*  And then the bulk of the commentary was about diversity, equity and inclusion and an executive [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2153.2000000000003s)]
*  order that he signed a few days ago that he says corrected an FAA policy that was hiring [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2160.0s)]
*  people who were not qualified to be air traffic controllers. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2166.36s)]
*  But then at another point, he said, didn't blame the air traffic controllers necessarily. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2169.8s)]
*  And he seemed to in fact be blaming maybe the pilots of the Army helicopter. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2174.2000000000003s)]
*  They were on the wrong path. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2178.2000000000003s)]
*  He said they should have seen. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2179.8s)]
*  It wasn't really clear by the end as I turned to our Ed O'Keefe here who was listening along [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2181.88s)]
*  with me what the president thought in a firm way was at fault at this hour. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2185.6400000000003s)]
*  He said it could have been. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2192.4s)]
*  He said he had common sense. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2194.5200000000004s)]
*  Didn't seem like he had firm conclusions, Ed. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2196.5200000000004s)]
*  No, Tony. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2199.4s)]
*  He seemed to be jumping to conclusions before an investigation begins saying I'm going to [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2202.44s)]
*  express my opinions knowing that it could take several years for an investigation to [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2205.92s)]
*  be completed. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2210.2400000000002s)]
*  Let's convey two pieces of information he shared. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2211.2400000000002s)]
*  First, he assured the flying public they should fly. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2213.12s)]
*  Second, that there will be a systematic investigation led by the FAA, the National Transportation [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2216.44s)]
*  Safety Board, the Defense Department to review what went on. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2221.04s)]
*  And he did name an acting administrator at the Federal Aviation Administration, a guy [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2224.4s)]
*  named Chris Rochello, a 22-year veteran who had been serving in a sort of active or acting [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2227.84s)]
*  role over the last several weeks because the then administrator and deputy quit earlier [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2233.28s)]
*  this month ahead of the Trump inauguration knowing they'd probably lose their job anyway. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2237.96s)]
*  But this focus on diversity, equity, inclusion programs is part of a big revamp of the federal [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2242.7200000000003s)]
*  policy and federal government that's underway going into agencies and saying if you've got [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2248.84s)]
*  any of these programs, they're being canceled. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2252.94s)]
*  The people that run them are being put on paid leave for now believing that across the [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2255.2000000000003s)]
*  been too much focus on those kinds of issues and not on the actual work of the agencies [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2260.12s)]
*  themselves. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2265.2s)]
*  Whether he's inferring here that somebody was in fact hired through that program is [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2266.68s)]
*  unclear, but he's at least using that as one scapegoat in the early hours of this investigation. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2271.08s)]
*  Tony? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2276.08s)]
*  Yeah, it certainly sounded that way, Ed. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2277.08s)]
*  You know, I'm reminded of the fact that from 2009, the last deadly crash like this, to [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2280.0s)]
*  this one, you had four different presidents who oversaw a remarkable stretch of safety [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2284.44s)]
*  in the skies. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2290.0800000000004s)]
*  They shared leadership during that time. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2291.0800000000004s)]
*  Now it seems like President Trump wants to put the blame on Biden and Obama, as he put [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2294.1200000000003s)]
*  it in this remarkable press conference. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2299.0400000000004s)]
*  We'll keep following it. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2300.8s)]

*  an army helicopter. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iH3u0W_C_Q&t=2311.88s)]
