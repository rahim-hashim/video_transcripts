# Crews around Los Angeles battling new wildfires, Trump threatening to withhold aid
**CBS News:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw)
*  Right now we're following breaking news out of California. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=0.0s)]
*  Authorities there are now dealing with new wildfires. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=2.84s)]
*  Crews are battling to gain control of the Hughes fire. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=6.44s)]
*  It's put more than 50,000 people under evacuation orders [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=9.76s)]
*  and warnings in northern LA. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  The fire has now burned more than 10,000 acres [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=15.56s)]
*  and stands at just 14% contained. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Meantime, further south, firefighters are also dealing [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=21.48s)]
*  with a new brush fire. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  This broke out overnight in Sepulveda Pass, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=25.6s)]
*  prompting some evacuation warnings in that area. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=29.0s)]
*  Currently, the fire is 0% contained. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=31.92s)]
*  I said, okay, let me get up. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=36.0s)]
*  So I got up and went to the backyard [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  and I could see already like the red flames [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=38.68s)]
*  on the other side of the hill. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=42.22s)]
*  So it was very scary. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=43.28s)]
*  I woke up everybody and we just started gathering stuff. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=44.92s)]
*  Yeah, I don't understand what's happening. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  We can't get a break. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=50.92s)]
*  Jonathan Bigliotti is following all the latest for us [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=53.52s)]
*  from Southern California. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  And good morning to you. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=58.440000000000005s)]
*  The Hughes fire currently burning [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=59.28s)]
*  in remote rugged terrain. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=60.64s)]
*  Fire crews overnight battling really an incredible effort [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=62.32s)]
*  stopping those flames from reaching neighborhoods. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=65.88s)]
*  At this hour, not a single structure [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=68.76s)]
*  has been reported damage, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=70.92s)]
*  but you still have at least 30,000 people [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=72.56s)]
*  under mandatory evacuation orders. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=74.4s)]
*  And we watched yesterday as many of them scrambled [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=76.2s)]
*  to flee to safety. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  Hundreds of fire crews are here on the ground [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=80.12s)]
*  battling the flames in remote canyons. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=82.7s)]
*  You also have aerial attacks still being conducted [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=85.2s)]
*  even in these high wind conditions. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  30 mile per hour wind gusts really fanned this fire. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=90.08s)]
*  It began yesterday morning and just a matter of two hours [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=93.44s)]
*  exploded in size to more than 5,000 acres. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=96.8s)]
*  At this hour, more than 10,000 acres have been destroyed, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=99.96s)]
*  but it is 14% contained. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, overnight, another fire is sparking [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  in the heart of LA, near the Bel Air area. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=108.19999999999999s)]
*  40 acres right now being burned. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=111.96s)]
*  There are fire crews responding to that scene. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=114.04s)]
*  The wind conditions that are fanning all of these fires [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  will continue through the afternoon. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=119.68s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=122.2s)]
*  All right, Jonathan, thank you for that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=123.04s)]
*  President Trump has threatened to withhold federal aid [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  from California unless leaders change their approach [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=128.16s)]
*  to water management. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=131.16s)]
*  In an interview with Fox News last night, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=133.0s)]
*  Trump repeated false claims that conservation efforts [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  in Northern California were responsible [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  for fire hydrants running dry in Southern California. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=140.56s)]
*  CBS News polling shows there is widespread [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=143.72s)]
*  nationwide support for providing relief [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  and disaster funds for LA County. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=148.72s)]
*  That's federal relief. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=151.72s)]
*  86% think Congress should authorize relief. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  And when you break this down by party, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=156.08s)]
*  it's also majorities. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=158.08s)]
*  95% of Democrats and 79% of Republicans support aid. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqU1-6xkhxw&t=159.28s)]
