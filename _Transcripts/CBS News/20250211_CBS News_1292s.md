# American teacher Marc Fogel arrives in U.S. after Russian captivity | Special Report
**CBS News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M)
*  This is a CBS News special report. I'm Chanel Call. Tonight, an American school teacher [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=0.0s)]
*  who was detained in Russia for the last four years is back on American soil. Mark Fogel [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=11.88s)]
*  is arriving at the White House just right now. You can see he just got there moments [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=18.0s)]
*  ago in his motorcade after being released from Russian captivity. And greeting him outside [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=22.52s)]
*  the doors of the White House this hour, President Donald Trump, they will be heading inside [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=28.46s)]
*  in just a few moments to speak to reporters who are there. But just a bit of background [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=32.9s)]
*  here. The Pennsylvania man was arrested in 2021 with 17 grams of marijuana, which his [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=37.74s)]
*  family said was used for back pain. This is also someone who was sentenced to 14 years [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=44.900000000000006s)]
*  in prison in Russia. And we can also report special envoy to the Middle East. Steve Witkoff [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=50.14s)]
*  left Russia with Fogel earlier today on his private plane. President Trump also, we understand, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=56.379999999999995s)]
*  pledged to get Fogel released when he met with Fogel's mother earlier this summer. The [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=63.0s)]
*  family released a statement today thanking Mr. Trump for his efforts in this. It is, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=67.53999999999999s)]
*  though, unclear what, if anything, the U.S. gave Russia in exchange. Again, we're looking [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=72.46s)]
*  at live images just outside the White House this hour. You can clearly see President Donald [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=78.46s)]
*  Trump greeting Mark Fogel, who just arrived on American soil after being detained in Russia [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=83.7s)]
*  for the last four years. They're about to go inside and we will hear from them inside [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=90.82000000000001s)]
*  the diplomatic room in the White House moments from now. Again, this was a long time coming [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  for Mark Fogel and his family who'd been advocating for this for many years now. I do think that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=101.82000000000001s)]
*  we have White House correspondent Weijia Jiang who is outside the White House this hour. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=108.53999999999999s)]
*  We'll go to her in just a few moments. Let's see if we can listen in to see if we can hear [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=114.02s)]
*  anything that these officials are talking about this hour. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=118.97999999999999s)]
*  I'm not one bin of coal I gave to Russia. You know what, of the ten letters, I got one [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=138.46s)]
*  for the moon as well. I added a scrapbook out of two things and I'm going to read it [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=160.58s)]
*  and I'm going to put that scrapbook on it today and I want it back. I put those juggles [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=168.46s)]
*  back in the scrapbook. Your picture is in it and it's giving me the shakedown. They're [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=175.46s)]
*  looking through it and I have the picture of you and my mom and you should have seen [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=180.46s)]
*  these guys. Well, their eyes lit up. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=184.46s)]
*  He's a very happy guy tonight. It's just a real honor. An honor to have you at the White House. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=259.46s)]
*  I feel like the luckiest man on earth right now. And I want you to know that I am not [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=267.46s)]
*  a hero in this at all. And President Trump is a hero. These men that came from the diplomatic [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=276.46s)]
*  service are heroes. The senators and representatives that passed legislation in my honor to get [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=287.46s)]
*  me home are the heroes. I am in awe of what they all did. My family has been a force. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=298.46s)]
*  I think my 95-year-old mother is probably the most dynamic 95-year-old on earth right [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=312.46s)]
*  now. And I am so indebted to so many people. I think I remember a Churchill quote that [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=320.46s)]
*  he said when the RAF was fighting the Luftwaffe and he said that, never have so many owed [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=330.46s)]
*  so much to so few. And I put myself fortunately and unfortunately into that category and I [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=340.46s)]
*  said never has one owed so much to so many that this super organism of people that came [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=348.46s)]
*  to my support and the love that I was given sustained me for three and a half years in [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=357.46s)]
*  a prison that had me in hospitals for more than 100 days. I was given more than 400 injections [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=369.46s)]
*  in that time. And knowing I had the support of my fellow Pennsylvanians, my family, my [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=379.46s)]
*  friends, it was so overwhelming that it brought me to my knees and it brought me to tears. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=389.46s)]
*  But it was my energy, it was my being that kept me going that whole time. And I will forever be [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=404.46s)]
*  indebted to President Trump, to Steve over there, what a dynamic man this guy is. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=417.46s)]
*  That's true. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=427.46s)]
*  When I met him, the energy, the can-do attitude just exudes from his body. And when he smiled at [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=428.46s)]
*  me and introduced me and I got the feel for what has happened, you know, it's not just me, it's [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=443.46s)]
*  everybody. And Secretary Rubio, who met my son a while back, I'm a middle class school teacher [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=449.46s)]
*  who's now in a dream world. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=460.46s)]
*  We're going to show you the Lincoln bedroom in a little while. It's a very special place. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=469.46s)]
*  It's appropriate for tonight. Very appropriate. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=474.46s)]
*  And thank you all. I love our country and I'm so happy to be back here. And I wish I could [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=478.46s)]
*  articulate it better. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=495.46s)]
*  You've done beautifully. He's got a great mother. And when I saw the mother at a rally, she said, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=497.46s)]
*  if you win, will you get my son out? And I promised she's 95 years old. And I said, we'll get [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=503.46s)]
*  him out. And we got him out pretty quickly. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=509.46s)]
*  She told me that exact words. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=512.46s)]
*  I remember. She made quite an impression. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=516.46s)]
*  And you also did. And I'm in awe of what you've done and your team. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=518.46s)]
*  It's great to have you back. And have a great life. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=525.46s)]
*  Mr. President, did you speak directly to President Putin about what happened? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=528.46s)]
*  Well, I don't want to say that. I just want to say that I appreciate very much what they did in [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=532.46s)]
*  letting Mark go home. And I appreciate Steve Witkoff's job he did. And Marko behind the scenes was [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=537.46s)]
*  unbelievable. And so many of these people were unbelievable. They represent him. They're from [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=545.46s)]
*  his area. And we just wanted to get him back home. I had to get him back home because I would have [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=551.46s)]
*  had big trouble with his mother. And we're going to take him for a little tour of the Lincoln bedroom, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=559.46s)]
*  which nobody gets to see. And it's very special. Do you want to see it? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=564.46s)]
*  I would love to. And I also should make mention that President Putin was very generous and statesman-like [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=568.46s)]
*  in granting me a pardon. I mean. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=577.46s)]
*  What were the terms of this deal, Mr. President? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=581.46s)]
*  Very fair. Very, very fair. Very reasonable. Not like deals you've seen over the years. They were very fair. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=584.46s)]
*  And I think that's going to lead. And somebody else is being released tomorrow that you will know of. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=591.46s)]
*  But we wanted to get this done very important. And Steve wanted to actually fly over and get Mark and [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=597.46s)]
*  get him home properly because it could be a pretty tough trip. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=603.46s)]
*  So is this the beginning of a deal, sir? Is this the start of a deal? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=607.46s)]
*  I think there's goodwill in terms of the war. You know, a million and a half soldiers, young people have been killed. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=610.46s)]
*  I've met many of them. Yeah. And it's a terrible thing going on. So we want to get that done. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=616.46s)]
*  I think this could be the very important element. You could be a big part of it, actually, because it could be a big, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=622.46s)]
*  important part of getting the war over with Ukraine. And we appreciate President Putin's, what he did. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=629.46s)]
*  He was able to pull it off for you, right? He was able to pull it off. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=637.46s)]
*  We think and you're here. I mean, so it was great. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=642.46s)]
*  We'll tell you a little bit more about it tomorrow. But I think we've made great progress, progress on the war also. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=647.46s)]
*  Getting the war. I want to get the war ended. That war should not have been. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=653.46s)]
*  It would have never happened if I was president. It would not have happened. And it did happen. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=657.46s)]
*  And it did happen. And now you have all blown up cities and dead people. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=661.46s)]
*  So many dead people should have never, ever happened. And you could be a big catalyst for just this evening. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=665.46s)]
*  It's a very important evening for ending that war. And I think they all want to see it ended. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=672.46s)]
*  Does that mean you gave assertions about Ukraine? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=677.46s)]
*  How does it change your perspective on Putin and your attitude? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=679.46s)]
*  Well, I don't want to get into that. I only can say this. We got a man home whose mother and family wanted him desperately, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=682.46s)]
*  whose state wanted him. He's become a big symbol. And it's an honor to have played a small role in that. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=689.46s)]
*  And I just I want to say these people, they all played a role and we got him home and he's healthy. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=698.46s)]
*  It looks good, actually. To me, you look damn good. I'll tell you that. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=706.46s)]
*  I think what expectations are low. Maybe that helps a little bit. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=709.46s)]
*  Can you tell us about the conditions of the prison that you were in, sir? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=714.46s)]
*  You know, I think I need a little bit of time to sort of digest all of that. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=718.46s)]
*  There were times when it was extremely trying. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=724.46s)]
*  There were times when I could manage it. But I think I need some more time to, you know, process it. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=730.46s)]
*  It wasn't easy, right? It wasn't easy. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=738.46s)]
*  Every second, every minute, every day had a challenge. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=741.46s)]
*  But you're in good shape. I mean, compare that to what we saw two days ago. Come home. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=744.46s)]
*  They were very, very ill. Those people are very ill. They were treated really badly. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=749.46s)]
*  I wouldn't say, but my predecessor should have had this gentleman out a long time ago. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=765.46s)]
*  You know, we did it in two and a half weeks. He had four years to do it. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=771.46s)]
*  He should have had Mark out a lot earlier. It's a shame. It's a shame. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=774.46s)]
*  It was very... He should have never had the war to start off with. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=781.46s)]
*  That war would have never happened if I was president. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=785.46s)]
*  But he should have had him back three and a half years ago. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=788.46s)]
*  So it was too bad, but he didn't do it. But we did it. Thank you all very much. Thank you very much. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=791.46s)]
*  Mr. President, are reciprocal terrorists still coming tomorrow, or are you waiting until you need to vote? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=797.46s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=802.46s)]
*  Have you spoken with President Xi? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=804.46s)]
*  All right, we're coming to you live from inside the White House this hour. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=807.46s)]
*  Again, just moments ago, we saw Mark Fogel, a Pennsylvania man, arrive back on American soil. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=811.46s)]
*  After returning home, he was detained in Russia for four years. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=817.46s)]
*  We actually heard some candid moments just outside the White House [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=821.46s)]
*  before President Trump and Mark Fogel walked into the diplomatic room. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=824.46s)]
*  You heard Mark Fogel. So talk about his release from captivity. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=828.46s)]
*  He had a mask on. He said he couldn't see what was going on. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=833.46s)]
*  And then, of course, we saw an image the White House had released just about an hour ago [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=836.46s)]
*  of Mark Fogel getting off the plane with this American flag draped across his neck. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=841.46s)]
*  I want to bring in Weijia Jiang, who is live for us at the White House this hour. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=847.46s)]
*  Weijia, such a huge moment for Mark Fogel's family [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=851.46s)]
*  and a notable victory for the Trump administration tonight. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=854.46s)]
*  Mark Fogel calling President Trump a hero. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=857.46s)]
*  This really was a remarkable moment, Chanel. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=862.46s)]
*  I mean, this is a president who truly values the drama and the impact of live television. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=865.46s)]
*  So to watch this all unfold in this way, you know, to have cameras capturing the very first time [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=871.46s)]
*  Fogel laid eyes on President Trump for the president of the United States to greet him [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=879.46s)]
*  at the White House and welcome him home and then immediately be whisked off [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=884.46s)]
*  to the diplomatic reception room to hear directly from the now freed American. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=889.46s)]
*  It was a stunning moment. And to your point, Mark Fogel expressed his deep gratitude [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=895.46s)]
*  for the administration bringing him home. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=901.46s)]
*  And this is a very personal story, Chanel, because his mother actually saw then-candidate Trump [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=905.46s)]
*  at the now historic Butler Rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where Mark Fogel is from. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=912.46s)]
*  And of course we know moments after the two met, the president, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=919.46s)]
*  there was an attempted assassination on his life. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=924.46s)]
*  But we know that Mark Fogel's mother, before that happened, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=927.46s)]
*  pled with Trump to bring her son home. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=930.46s)]
*  And he promised if he was elected to be president, he would do just that. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=935.46s)]
*  So that is a promise kept from President Trump to the Fogel family, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=940.46s)]
*  something his family has been speaking about publicly today. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=945.46s)]
*  And so, yeah, this is a tremendous victory for President Trump. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=950.46s)]
*  He is not divulging any terms of the deal, and neither are his aides. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=954.46s)]
*  We don't know what Russia got in exchange for this. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=959.46s)]
*  We know that President Trump said not much. He said it was a very good deal. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=962.46s)]
*  We know that the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, as well as the U.S. envoy for hostages, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=966.46s)]
*  Adam Bowler, spoke earlier tonight and said there's not a one-for-one trade that happened tonight. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=972.46s)]
*  They didn't release somebody back into Russian custody, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=978.46s)]
*  but said that President Trump would consider doing so for someone who is nonviolent [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=982.46s)]
*  and currently held in the U.S. or perhaps by a U.S. ally. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=987.46s)]
*  We don't know any details of that. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=991.46s)]
*  But yes, Chanel, this was a truly remarkable moment here at the White House. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=993.46s)]
*  The president just said that he was going to show Mark Fogel the Lincoln bedroom. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=998.46s)]
*  He is a teacher of history, a student of history, and Fogel seemed excited about that. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1003.46s)]
*  But you have to imagine the state of mind he is in. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1010.46s)]
*  In fact, one of the reporters asked about what conditions were like in prison, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1013.46s)]
*  and he said he was not ready to talk about that because he had to process all of it. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1018.46s)]
*  So here he is standing next to the president of the United States at the White House, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1023.46s)]
*  being given a tour of the Lincoln bedroom. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1028.46s)]
*  He said it was a dream, and I'm sure that's what it feels like for him tonight, Chanel. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1031.46s)]
*  And you know, Weijia, that we'd heard from Mark Fogel's family the last couple of years. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1036.46s)]
*  They'd been advocating for the Biden administration to do more to bring him home. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1041.46s)]
*  Now we saw Trump saying just moments ago, our administration was able to do this, he says, in two weeks. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1046.46s)]
*  I want to ask about how this happened and Steve Wittkopf's role in all this, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1052.46s)]
*  President Trump's special envoy to the Middle East. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1057.46s)]
*  Well, President Biden and President Trump have very different relationships [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1060.46s)]
*  with Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1065.46s)]
*  And Trump administration officials themselves say that Putin, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1067.46s)]
*  as well as leaders from Venezuela and other countries that have given up American hostages, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1071.46s)]
*  want to get in Trump's good graces. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1076.46s)]
*  They believe that this is a step toward showing that there is goodwill there. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1079.46s)]
*  And even though the two are not directly linked, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1084.46s)]
*  President Trump himself said that this is a sign that good things are to come [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1087.46s)]
*  with regard to the end of Russia's invasion into Ukraine, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1091.46s)]
*  which is one of his foreign policy goals, to help broker some kind of an agreement to end that war. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1096.46s)]
*  And while we don't know exactly what led to this freeing of Mark Fogel, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1103.46s)]
*  there were many people involved, including Middle East envoy Steve Wittkopf, who you mentioned. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1110.46s)]
*  And even though this did not happen in the Middle East, this is obviously in Russia, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1115.46s)]
*  he did play a role. And in fact, he took his private plane on his own dime [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1120.46s)]
*  to pick up Fogel and bring him back to the United States. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1126.46s)]
*  And we got Trump also just saying tonight there will be another release tomorrow. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1130.46s)]
*  Do we know any more about this? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1134.46s)]
*  Again, this is somebody who loves to build up the suspense. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1137.46s)]
*  And so he and his administration officials have said, stay tuned. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1140.46s)]
*  There is another American who is being free tomorrow. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1145.46s)]
*  We don't know who. We don't know where that person was being held. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1148.46s)]
*  We don't know under what circumstances or conditions. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1151.46s)]
*  But, you know, the U.S. hostage envoy even said, you know, your viewers are going to need something for tomorrow. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1154.46s)]
*  So teasing the fact that tomorrow they will have another major announcement [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1163.46s)]
*  when it comes to bringing another American back to U.S. soil. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1170.46s)]
*  And, Weijia, I just want to ask as well, because we didn't see a swap on the tarmac [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1174.46s)]
*  like we may have seen in previous deals like this tonight. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1179.46s)]
*  And as you mentioned earlier, it's unclear what exactly, if anything, the U.S. gave up [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1183.46s)]
*  in exchange for getting Mark Fogel back here in the U.S. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1188.46s)]
*  But what kind of impact could this have on America's role in Russia's invasion of Ukraine [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1192.46s)]
*  and the status of the war going forward? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1198.46s)]
*  Well, again, the administration has said it is a sign that Putin is acting in good faith, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1201.46s)]
*  that he wants to come to the table, that perhaps they would be able to at least start the conversation [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1208.46s)]
*  about how that would be brokered. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1216.46s)]
*  But I don't want to get ahead of our skeet, Chanel, because the two, while they are indirectly related [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1218.46s)]
*  as it relates to the sort of perception that Putin may be wanting to present to President Trump, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1224.46s)]
*  we should not read into what that means for the literal end of the war. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1232.46s)]
*  There are many, many diplomatic steps that have to happen, but Trump has made no secret [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1238.46s)]
*  about the fact that he wants to be a major player in that negotiation. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1243.46s)]
*  All right, some important contacts there. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1248.46s)]
*  Weijia Jiang, thank you so much. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1250.46s)]
*  And again, breaking news tonight, Mark Fogel, a Pennsylvania resident, is back on American soil [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1254.46s)]
*  after being released from Russia's officials there. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1259.46s)]
*  He was held and detained there for four years and tonight is back and welcomed [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1263.46s)]
*  by President Donald Trump inside the White House. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1269.46s)]
*  Our coverage will continue here on CBS News 24-7, your local news, and tomorrow on CBS Mornings. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1271.46s)]
*  This has been a CBS News special report. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1277.46s)]
*  I'm Chanel Call in New York. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1280.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-li4kB7T9M&t=1284.46s)]
