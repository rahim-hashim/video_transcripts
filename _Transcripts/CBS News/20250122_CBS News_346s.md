# Record-breaking snow triggers flight cancellations, school and business closures in U.S. South
**CBS News:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho)
*  Well, a bone-chilling polar vortex has led to freezing temperatures throughout the U.S., [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=0.0s)]
*  even reaching parts of the Gulf Coast. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=5.0s)]
*  Cities like Houston, New Orleans, even Pensacola, Florida are seeing record snowfall. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=7.48s)]
*  They aren't well-equipped for the elements. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=12.64s)]
*  Snowy weather has triggered flight cancellations and closed schools and businesses throughout [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=14.96s)]
*  the region. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=18.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, other parts of the country continue to endure the cold, with temperatures well [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=19.6s)]
*  below freezing throughout most of the north. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=23.76s)]
*  CBS News reporter Katie Weiss gives us an update from a frigid New Orleans. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=26.04s)]
*  For the first time in the Big Easy, coming through and plowing and clearing the roads [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=56.04s)]
*  that were hammered by the storm and covered in thick sheets of ice, we also spoke with [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=62.04s)]
*  some local businesses that are slowly getting back open and have been shoveling and getting [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=67.2s)]
*  their parking lots safe for people to walk on because it has been quite a slippery mess [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=73.48s)]
*  for many people. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=78.52s)]
*  I also spoke with some tourists who have enjoyed coming to the French Quarter and some locals [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=79.52s)]
*  who just wanted to come and enjoy this winter wonderland and appreciate it for all that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=84.84s)]
*  it is because it's something that never happens here on the Gulf Coast and it's a memory that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=89.88s)]
*  many people here will cherish. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=95.56s)]
*  But for others, this event has been something serious and horrific. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=97.6s)]
*  It has barreled through and hammered several states across the Gulf Coast, from Texas to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  Florida. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=108.6s)]
*  Unfortunately, we know now today after this storm has made its way through those Gulf [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=110.16s)]
*  states that nine people lost their lives due to this horrific storm. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=115.47999999999999s)]
*  This winter storm has been something of truly epic proportions that has challenged many [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=121.0s)]
*  of these local cities that are not used to these northern weather conditions. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=126.0s)]
*  At this hour, we know that the city, as I mentioned, has hired an Indiana-based snow [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=131.68s)]
*  plow company to bring down 14 snow plows to come and clear the roads. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=137.76s)]
*  We know that they've been working on that all day today and that they're planning to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=142.76s)]
*  send down actually 14 more snow plows within the next 24 hours. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=146.84s)]
*  They're planning to also send some of those snow plows across the bridge here over to [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=153.4s)]
*  the Jefferson Parish to go help those neighborhoods there because I talked with some locals who [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=157.36s)]
*  said that those neighborhoods still desperately need clearing at this time. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=162.32s)]
*  We're going to continue to keep an eye on conditions for you and keep you updated as [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=167.4s)]
*  we have been since early yesterday on every detail with this winter storm. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=170.48s)]
*  But until then, I'll send it back to you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=175.2s)]
*  Katie Weiss, thank you. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=177.2s)]
*  Power outages related to winter weather are happening twice as often as they did decades [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=179.28s)]
*  ago and that's partly because some stores or storms are becoming more intense and because [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=183.44s)]
*  of an aging power grid. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=188.4s)]
*  CBS News' Dave Malkoff shows us how some homes are becoming mini power plants to support [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=190.12s)]
*  themselves and their communities. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=195.16s)]
*  First of all, what a view. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=198.28s)]
*  This is your house? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=201.48s)]
*  Yeah, welcome to Draper, Utah. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=202.48s)]
*  This is paradise. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=204.72s)]
*  John Walsh gives back to his beautiful neighborhood overlooking Salt Lake City in different ways, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=206.12s)]
*  sometimes offering a pie to his neighbors, another pie, huh? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=213.48s)]
*  And sometimes offering his house as a warm shelter like he did two years ago. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  We had about seven feet of snow out here. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=224.44s)]
*  In the Suncrest neighborhood, cars are buried in powder. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=226.44s)]
*  Their heaviest snowfall in 25 years cut out neighborhood lights and heat. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=230.32000000000002s)]
*  Well, I remember calling over to you and asking you if you wanted to come over because you [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=235.68s)]
*  didn't have any electricity. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  But how did you have power when everybody else didn't have power? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=242.08s)]
*  With that battery out there, I always have power. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=245.0s)]
*  This big battery in his garage is charged by nearly 30 solar panels on his roof. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=248.62s)]
*  This is a solution for the future. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=254.74s)]
*  For most of us, a centralized power plant sends electricity to your home. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  If a tree falls on a line in your neighborhood or the plant faces extreme winter conditions, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=261.68s)]
*  you could lose power. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=267.6s)]
*  But in this decentralized system, the batteries in these homes keep their power on. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=269.32s)]
*  Plus, they're giving power back to the grid, sharing it with the entire community. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=275.7s)]
*  It's known as a virtual power plant or VPP. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=282.58s)]
*  We see it benefits from any winter storm, any outage, any disruption in a power plant [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=286.65999999999997s)]
*  or even any disruption in a transmission line. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=291.26s)]
*  And because of the new VPP model, Bill Como's power company doesn't rely as much on fossil fuels. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=293.53999999999996s)]
*  So this used to be a coal power plant, but now you only use it for emergencies, really. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=300.82s)]
*  Yeah, it was converted to natural gas for peaking time periods. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=306.86s)]
*  But that's where VPPs come in, is they help offset the need for these types of power plants. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=309.86s)]
*  For homeowners, this system is expensive. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=315.78s)]
*  Leasing it could cost about $90 a month, but that's offset by lower power bills. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=318.7s)]
*  However, value... [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=324.9s)]
*  It's good to contribute. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=326.58s)]
*  ...is not just measured in dollars. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=328.14s)]
*  I'd rather give than take. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=330.5s)]
*  Give me a maker. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=332.5s)]
*  From where he sits... [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=333.5s)]
*  Oh, you good boy. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=334.5s)]
*  ...it's all about investing in his paradise, just outside that window. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQb25Y9ZQho&t=335.5s)]
