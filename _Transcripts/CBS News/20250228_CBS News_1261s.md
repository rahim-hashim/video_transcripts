*  Mr. President, Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=31.160000000000004s)]
*  Right now you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=34.440000000000005s)]
*  have manpower problems. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=38.96s)]

*  America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=66.6s)]

*  You haven't been allowed. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=189.52s)]
*  We gave you through this stupid president $350 billion. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=190.52s)]
*  We gave you military equipment. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=195.52s)]
*  And you men are brave but they have to use our military. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=197.68s)]
*  If you didn't have our military equipment, if you didn't have our military equipment [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=200.68s)]
*  this war would have been over in two weeks. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=206.68s)]
*  In three days. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=209.68s)]
*  I heard it from Putin. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=210.68s)]
*  In three days. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=211.68s)]
*  This is something you do in two weeks. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=212.68s)]
*  Of course yes. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  I tell you. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=218.0s)]
*  Just say thank you. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=219.0s)]
*  I said it a lot of times. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=220.08s)]
*  Say it to American people. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=222.08s)]
*  Accept that there are disagreements and let's go litigate those disagreements rather than [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  trying to fight it out in the American media when you're wrong. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=227.84s)]
*  We know that you're wrong. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=231.52s)]
*  But you see I think it's good for the American people to see what's going on. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=232.52s)]
*  I understand sir. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=235.52s)]
*  I think it's very important. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=236.52s)]
*  That's why I kept this going so long. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=237.52s)]
*  You have to be thankful. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=240.16000000000003s)]
*  You don't have the cards. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=241.16000000000003s)]
*  I'm thankful. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=242.16000000000003s)]
*  You're buried there. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=243.16000000000003s)]
*  You're people are dying. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=244.16000000000003s)]
*  I can tell you. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=245.16000000000003s)]
*  You're running low on soldiers. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=246.16000000000003s)]
*  I know. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=247.16000000000003s)]
*  Don't play this. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=248.16000000000003s)]
*  You're running low on soldiers. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=249.16000000000003s)]
*  It would be a damn good thing. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=250.16000000000003s)]
*  And then you can't. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=251.16000000000003s)]
*  Then you tell us I don't want to ceasefire. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=252.24s)]
*  I don't want to ceasefire. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=255.32s)]
*  I want to go and I wanted this. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=256.6s)]
*  Look, if you could get a ceasefire right now, I'd tell you you take it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=258.92s)]
*  So the bullets stop flying and your men stuff. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=263.0s)]
*  Of course, we want to stop the war. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=265.32s)]
*  But I think you don't want to see. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=267.44s)]
*  I said to you, I want to see. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=268.44s)]
*  Because you get a ceasefire faster than an agreement. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=271.12s)]
*  Ask our people about this fire. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=273.32s)]
*  What they think that was for you. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=275.12s)]
*  That wasn't with me. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=277.84s)]
*  That was with a guy named Biden who was not a smart person. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=279.56s)]
*  That was your president. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=283.08s)]
*  That was with Obama. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=284.08s)]
*  It was your president. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=285.08s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=286.08s)]
*  That was with Obama who gave you sheets and I gave you javelins. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=287.08s)]
*  I gave you the javelins to take out all those tanks. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=290.56s)]
*  Obama gave you sheets. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=294.32s)]
*  In fact, the statement is Obama gave sheets and Trump gave javelins. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=296.32s)]
*  You got to be more thankful because let me tell you, you don't have the cards. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=301.92s)]
*  With us, you have the cards. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=306.4s)]

*  One more question to Mr. Vice President. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  It's going to be a tough deal to make because the attitudes have to change. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=313.40000000000003s)]
*  What if Russia breaks the ceasefire? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  What if Russia breaks these talks? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  What do you do then? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=323.40000000000003s)]
*  I understand that it's a heated conversation right now. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  What are you saying? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=327.40000000000003s)]

*  What if anything? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=332.40000000000003s)]

*  Okay? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  Why did they break it? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=337.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=338.44s)]
*  They broke it with Biden because Biden, they didn't respect him. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=339.44s)]
*  They didn't respect Obama. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=342.44s)]
*  They respect me. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=344.44s)]
*  Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=346.44s)]
*  He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=349.44s)]
*  Russia, Russia, Russia. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=353.44s)]
*  You ever hear of that deal? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=354.44s)]
*  That was a phony, that was a phony Hunter Biden, Joe Biden scam. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=355.44s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, Shifty Adam Schiff. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=360.44s)]
*  It was a Democrat scam. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=363.44s)]
*  And he had to go through that. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=365.48s)]
*  And he did go through it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=367.48s)]
*  We didn't end up in a war. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=368.48s)]
*  And he went through it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=370.48s)]
*  He was accused of all that stuff. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=371.48s)]
*  He had nothing to do with it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=372.48s)]
*  It came out of Hunter Biden's bathroom. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=374.48s)]
*  It came out of Hunter Biden's bedroom. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=377.48s)]
*  It was disgusting. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=380.48s)]
*  And then they said, oh, oh, the laptop from hell was made by Russia. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=382.48s)]
*  The 51 agents. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=388.48s)]
*  The whole thing was a scam. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=389.48s)]
*  And he had to put up with that. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=391.48s)]
*  He was being accused of all that stuff. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=392.48s)]
*  All I can say is this. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=394.52000000000004s)]
*  He might have broken deals with Obama and Bush, and he might have broken them with Biden. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  He did, maybe. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=402.52000000000004s)]

*  I don't know what happened, but he didn't break them with me. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=404.52000000000004s)]
*  He wants to make a deal. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=406.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't know if he can make a deal. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=408.52000000000004s)]
*  The problem is I've empowered you to be a tough guy. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=409.52000000000004s)]
*  And I don't think you'd be a tough guy without the United States. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=413.52000000000004s)]
*  And your people are very brave. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  But you're either going to make a deal or we're out. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=419.52000000000004s)]
*  And if we're out, you'll fight it out. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=422.56s)]
*  I don't think it's going to be pretty, but you'll fight it out. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=425.56s)]
*  But you don't have the cards. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=428.56s)]
*  But once we sign that deal, you're in a much better position. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=430.56s)]
*  But you're not acting at all thankful. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=434.56s)]
*  And that's not a nice thing. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=436.56s)]
*  I'll be honest. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=438.56s)]
*  That's not a nice thing. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=439.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=440.56s)]
*  I think we've seen enough. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=441.56s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=442.56s)]
*  This is going to be great television. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=443.56s)]
*  I will say that. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=446.56s)]
*  I will say that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=447.6s)]

*  I love this. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=454.6s)]
*  Can I meet the back of your seat? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=455.6s)]
*  Extraordinary moments there in the White House. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=460.6s)]
*  Moments ago, Donald Trump meeting with Zelensky, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=462.6s)]
*  President Zelensky of Ukraine. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=464.6s)]
*  Vice President JD Vance there as well. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=466.6s)]
*  It devolved quickly into a shouting match. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=469.6s)]
*  Donald Trump saying things like, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=471.6s)]
*  you're in no position to dictate the terms of what we're doing here. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=473.6s)]
*  You're gambling with World War III. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=476.64000000000004s)]
*  You don't have the cards. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=478.64000000000004s)]
*  You got to be more thankful. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=479.64000000000004s)]
*  And then he put a punctuation point on it here [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=480.64000000000004s)]
*  that you are just going to make a deal or we are out with that. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=483.64000000000004s)]
*  I want to bring in Face the Nation moderator [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=488.64000000000004s)]
*  and Chief Foreign Affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=490.64000000000004s)]
*  Unbelievable moments there, Margaret. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=492.64000000000004s)]
*  What did you make of what you just saw? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=494.64000000000004s)]
*  Well, Maurice, that meeting went just about as poorly as it possibly could [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=496.64000000000004s)]
*  for Ukraine, which relies so heavily on U.S.-made weapons. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=501.64000000000004s)]
*  Even if European allies are helping to supply it, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=505.68s)]
*  it is U.S.-made weapons that the Ukrainians are relying on. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=508.68s)]
*  The president repeatedly pointing back to that. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=512.68s)]
*  A few things there that seem to have ignited this exchange [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=515.68s)]
*  in front of the camera. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=519.68s)]
*  You know, it was JD Vance who jumped into the conversation [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=521.68s)]
*  arguing that there is a path to peace through diplomacy. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=526.68s)]
*  The thing that seemed to be the irritant was when President Zelensky [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=530.7199999999999s)]
*  pointed out that there had been repeated diplomatic deals [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=535.7199999999999s)]
*  with Vladimir Putin of Russia to stop the Ukraine invasion. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=540.7199999999999s)]
*  But that was back after the 2014 partial invasion. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=545.7199999999999s)]
*  And President Zelensky made that point saying [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=549.7199999999999s)]
*  we have had ceasefires and Russia has violated them [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=552.7199999999999s)]
*  and just used it to rebuild and then go through with the Ukraine. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=555.7199999999999s)]
*  He pointed out that that happened not just on President Obama's watch [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=559.76s)]
*  but then on President Trump's. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=564.76s)]
*  It was the so-called Minsk agreement that fell apart in 2019. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=566.76s)]
*  Donald Trump was president of the United States at that point. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=571.76s)]
*  So while you hear President Trump repeatedly say [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=574.76s)]
*  Vladimir Putin hasn't broken deals on my watch, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=577.76s)]
*  Zelensky was pointing out actually this did happen on your watch. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=580.76s)]
*  President Trump also pushing at him saying [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=584.76s)]
*  that provided Ukraine weapons, defensive weapons. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=586.8s)]
*  That is an accurate statement. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=589.8s)]
*  The Obama administration did not provide defensive weaponry [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=591.8s)]
*  to Ukraine after that 2014 invasion, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=594.8s)]
*  afraid it would somehow provoke Vladimir Putin. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=597.8s)]
*  It was Javelin missiles in 2017 that the United States [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=600.8s)]
*  did provide under Donald Trump to Ukraine. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=603.8s)]
*  So there was this sort of rewriting of history going back and forth here [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=606.8s)]
*  and it was JD Vance that pointed out that there was a path [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=610.8s)]
*  going back and forth here and it was JD Vance, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=613.8399999999999s)]
*  the vice president who jumped in sort of defending Donald Trump [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=616.8399999999999s)]
*  and also saying to President Zelensky, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=620.8399999999999s)]
*  you haven't been thankful enough. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=622.8399999999999s)]
*  One other fact here that I want to go back to for the record, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=624.8399999999999s)]
*  you heard President Trump say we gave $350 billion to Ukraine. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=627.8399999999999s)]
*  According to the CBS confirmed unit totals of USAID, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=632.8399999999999s)]
*  that's not an accurate number. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=635.8399999999999s)]
*  The US government's Ukraine oversight group reported [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=637.8399999999999s)]
*  that Congress has appropriated $183 billion [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=640.88s)]
*  for the broader Ukraine response. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=643.88s)]
*  The bottom line here though is America is the chief weapons supplier [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=646.88s)]
*  helping Ukraine defend its democracy against Russia. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=650.88s)]
*  And any further congressional support is going to be hard to get through [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=655.88s)]
*  and hard to get President Trump to sign off on [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=659.88s)]
*  unless he decides that Vladimir Putin isn't abiding [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=662.88s)]
*  by this adjep, unagreed upon ceasefire and peace deal. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=667.92s)]
*  President Trump said he's the one who can change the game [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=671.92s)]
*  but it was just really explosive here [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=675.92s)]
*  and it was a punctuation point on a week [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=678.92s)]
*  where a number of European leaders, Maurice, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=681.92s)]
*  have come to the White House to try to persuade President Trump [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=683.92s)]
*  that Europe isn't freeloading, that Europe is doing a lot [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=687.92s)]
*  and that Ukraine is the victim here of Russian aggression [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=690.92s)]
*  and that that should be clearly stated. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=695.9599999999999s)]
*  Remember, Maurice, before I hand it back to you, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=697.9599999999999s)]
*  that it was a rewriting of the facts that we saw this week [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=700.9599999999999s)]
*  with the President of the United States no longer wanting to say [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=704.9599999999999s)]
*  that Russia was the aggressor in this conflict. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=707.9599999999999s)]
*  And it was Russia that invaded Ukraine in 2022. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=710.9599999999999s)]
*  As the whole world would seem to know, Margaret, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=715.9599999999999s)]
*  as we've been pointing out all week, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=718.9599999999999s)]
*  let's think about this here for a second, Margaret. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=721.9599999999999s)]
*  The President of Ukraine came here to try to make a deal, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=725.0s)]
*  to try to deal with President Trump on negotiating [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=728.0s)]
*  to give the United States some access to the returns, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=732.0s)]
*  the funding from the country's special minerals that they have there. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=734.0s)]
*  Instead, they started looking backwards. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=739.0s)]
*  There was no looking forward to what the deal, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=741.0s)]
*  what the peace is going to look like in terms of security for Ukraine, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=744.0s)]
*  in terms of dealing with Russia. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=748.0s)]
*  This all went backwards. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=749.0s)]
*  I've never seen anything go backwards like that [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=751.0s)]
*  and sideways as well at the same time, Margaret. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=754.04s)]
*  Have you? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=757.04s)]
*  No, I haven't. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=758.04s)]
*  And, Maurice, you put your finger on something very important there, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=759.04s)]
*  which is that there was a lot of baggage that came into that room [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=762.04s)]
*  with President Zelensky when he walked in [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=765.04s)]
*  and sat down across from President Trump. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=768.04s)]
*  And President Trump went there. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=770.04s)]
*  He went back and started— [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=772.04s)]
*  actually, towards a reporter, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=774.04s)]
*  the President of the United States started yelling, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=776.04s)]
*  what if a bomb fell on your head, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=779.04s)]
*  saying, like, basically anything can happen? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=781.04s)]
*  But then he started talking about Russian election meddling. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=783.0799999999999s)]
*  If you remember, in 2016, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=787.0799999999999s)]
*  with the first election of Donald Trump to the presidency, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=790.0799999999999s)]
*  there were extensive investigations run by Congress, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=793.0799999999999s)]
*  run by the FBI, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=797.0799999999999s)]
*  into the degree to which Russian disinformation efforts [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=798.0799999999999s)]
*  and meddling in the electoral process may have influenced the outcome. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=803.0799999999999s)]
*  President Trump, whenever Russia comes up as a topic, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=807.0799999999999s)]
*  often refers to it. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=811.0799999999999s)]
*  He did it yesterday in the Oval Office yesterday, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=812.12s)]
*  also sitting next to the UK prime minister, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=814.12s)]
*  said when it comes to Vladimir Putin, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=817.12s)]
*  he went through what he calls the Russian election hoax with me. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=820.12s)]
*  I don't know what he's meaning by that, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=825.12s)]
*  but he brought up the 2016 election meddling in 2025. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=828.12s)]
*  And with Vladimir Zelensky, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=835.12s)]
*  you remember he also has a unique place [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=837.16s)]
*  in the first Trump administration's history [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=840.16s)]
*  because it was that phone call [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=843.16s)]
*  that then became public discussing U.S. aid to Ukraine [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=846.16s)]
*  that was the, and whether it was withheld for political purposes, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=851.16s)]
*  that was the focus of the first impeachment of Donald Trump. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=855.16s)]
*  The President of the United States just brought up [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=859.16s)]
*  Hunter Biden's bathroom, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=862.16s)]
*  and I think that was a reference back to that impeachment. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=863.16s)]
*  So, Maurice, there was a lot of baggage [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=866.1999999999999s)]
*  that was brought into this conversation, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=868.1999999999999s)]
*  which was supposed to be about a minerals agreement [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=870.1999999999999s)]
*  and investment between the U.S. and Ukraine. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=874.1999999999999s)]
*  Kind of lost at the moment. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=876.1999999999999s)]
*  Okay, Margaret Brennan, thank you so much for the insight. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=878.1999999999999s)]
*  Let's head over to Nancy Cordes, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=880.1999999999999s)]
*  chief White House correspondent. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=882.1999999999999s)]
*  Nancy, that was really something to witness. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=883.1999999999999s)]
*  Where do we go from here? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=886.1999999999999s)]
*  That is a great question, Maurice, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=888.1999999999999s)]
*  because the leaders are meeting behind closed doors right now, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=890.1999999999999s)]
*  and after that, they're supposed to be meeting [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=893.1999999999999s)]
*  after that, they're supposed to hold a news conference [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=895.24s)]
*  with the President standing side by side, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=898.24s)]
*  two podiums with President Zelensky, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=901.24s)]
*  and we're asking whether that news conference [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=903.24s)]
*  is still going to go forward after the spectacle [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=906.24s)]
*  that we just witnessed in the Oval Office. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=908.24s)]
*  What I can tell you is that at this hour, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=910.24s)]
*  TV news crews are still setting up for that news conference [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=913.24s)]
*  as if it's happening, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=915.24s)]
*  and the White House press secretary a few minutes ago [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=917.24s)]
*  posted the video of that tense exchange [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=920.24s)]
*  and said, quote, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=924.28s)]
*  President Trump and Vice President Vance [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=925.28s)]
*  are standing up for the American people. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=927.28s)]
*  So the Trump White House is owning this moment. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=930.28s)]
*  They are trumpeting this moment. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=934.28s)]
*  They are making sure that it gets out there, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=936.28s)]
*  and the question is where we go from here, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=939.28s)]
*  because ostensibly, Zelensky had come here to Washington [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=943.28s)]
*  to sign a minerals deal, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=947.28s)]
*  and obviously what happened in the Oval Office [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=950.28s)]
*  is that as they talked to reporters [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=953.3199999999999s)]
*  for about 45 minutes before you even got [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=956.3199999999999s)]
*  to that very combative exchange at the very end, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=959.3199999999999s)]
*  the tension was ratcheting up the entire time [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=963.3199999999999s)]
*  because President Trump wanted to talk about [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=966.3199999999999s)]
*  this big, beautiful minerals deal [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=969.3199999999999s)]
*  and how the U.S. was going to be an investor [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=971.3199999999999s)]
*  and what the U.S. was going to get out of it, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=973.3199999999999s)]
*  while Zelensky, unsurprisingly, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=975.3199999999999s)]
*  wanted to focus much more on security for his country [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=977.3199999999999s)]
*  and a peace deal [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=981.36s)]
*  and trying to make the case in front of the cameras [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=983.36s)]
*  to President Trump and obviously the Vice President [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=987.36s)]
*  that Vladimir Putin was someone who couldn't be trusted [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=990.36s)]
*  and that, in his words, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=993.36s)]
*  Putin was a terrorist who doesn't abide [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=995.36s)]
*  by the rules of war or the rules of peace. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=997.36s)]
*  And that appears to be what really rankled [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1000.36s)]
*  President Trump, and eventually, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1003.36s)]
*  after taking questions [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1005.36s)]
*  and making their various positions known for 45 minutes, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1007.36s)]
*  led to this outburst. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1010.4s)]
*  Nancy, I know you've been in the Oval many times. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1012.4s)]
*  You've covered the White House for a good long time. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1015.4s)]
*  Has anything like that ever materialized before your eyes? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1017.4s)]
*  Well, certainly not in the Biden years, Maurice, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1022.4s)]
*  and part of that is because typically [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1025.4s)]
*  when President Biden and most presidents welcome [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1029.4s)]
*  a foreign leader into the Oval Office, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1032.4s)]
*  a pool, a small group of reporters, is allowed in, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1034.4s)]
*  just like I was yesterday when Prime Minister [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1037.44s)]
*  Keir Starmer of the UK was visiting. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1040.44s)]
*  We're allowed in. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1043.44s)]
*  The two men are sitting in chairs [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1044.44s)]
*  or the two leaders are sitting in chairs, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1046.44s)]
*  just like you see there. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1048.44s)]
*  They both make a little statement. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1050.44s)]
*  Maybe the president takes one or two questions [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1052.44s)]
*  and then we're ushered out. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1055.44s)]
*  We're shouting, we're trying to get more questions answered, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1057.44s)]
*  but typically that's called a spray. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1059.44s)]
*  It doesn't last very long, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1061.44s)]
*  and then they actually get down to business [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1062.44s)]
*  behind closed doors. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1065.44s)]
*  What President Trump clearly likes to do [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1066.48s)]
*  is hold court, take lots of questions. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1068.48s)]
*  The foreign leader takes lots of questions [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1072.48s)]
*  and that poses an interesting challenge [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1074.48s)]
*  and dilemma for the foreign leader who is at his side. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1077.48s)]
*  To make a case in public that he thinks will get him farther [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1082.48s)]
*  than if he does it in private, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1087.48s)]
*  and in this case that calculation by Zelensky [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1089.48s)]
*  appears to have backfired [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1092.48s)]
*  because President Trump basically ended up scolding him [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1094.52s)]
*  the way someone might scold a teenager, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1098.52s)]
*  telling him, you're ungrateful [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1100.52s)]
*  and you need to say thank you. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1102.52s)]
*  And the situation just evolved from there. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1104.52s)]
*  Yes, supposed to be a photo op, Nancy, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1107.52s)]
*  but your gambling with World War III [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1109.52s)]
*  came out of that eventually from President Trump. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1111.52s)]
*  Nancy, court is at the White House. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1114.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1115.52s)]
*  Let's go to our MTS Tyab in Kyiv in Ukraine. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1116.52s)]
*  I don't know, MTS, if you've had a chance [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1120.52s)]
*  to gauge any kind of reaction at this point [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1121.52s)]
*  I know it's early, but what did you make of what you saw? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1123.56s)]
*  It is quite a scene at the White House here in Kyiv. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1129.56s)]
*  People, of course, are digesting what they've just seen. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1132.56s)]
*  We've been looking online trying to see [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1135.56s)]
*  what the sort of mood here is in Ukraine. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1137.56s)]
*  Some of the quotes coming out are, you know, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1140.56s)]
*  and again, this is online, some saying, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1143.56s)]
*  you know, bring back nuclear weapons to Ukraine. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1145.56s)]
*  Of course, Ukraine denuclearized itself some time ago, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1148.56s)]
*  but really what we're seeing [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1152.6s)]
*  is a lot of support for Zelensky. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1153.6s)]
*  In fact, we were also speaking a little bit earlier [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1155.6s)]
*  to a senior Ukrainian official [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1157.6s)]
*  who said that the president, the Ukrainian president, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1159.6s)]
*  was in his words, quote, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1161.6s)]
*  ambushed by President Trump and the vice president as well. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1163.6s)]
*  Take from that what you will, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1167.6s)]
*  but I think many Ukrainians [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1169.6s)]
*  who will no doubt be seeing this later tonight [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1171.6s)]
*  or indeed when they wake up in the morning [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1173.6s)]
*  will be shocked by the scenes that they saw [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1175.6s)]
*  in the White House. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1177.6s)]
*  Again, this was an extraordinary scene [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1179.6399999999999s)]
*  because you have to remember just 24 hours ago [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1182.6399999999999s)]
*  we heard from President Trump [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1184.6399999999999s)]
*  where he walked back calling or accusing [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1186.6399999999999s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky of being a dictator. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1188.6399999999999s)]
*  That, of course, is not true. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1191.6399999999999s)]
*  It's a false statement. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1193.6399999999999s)]
*  And so there was some hope that [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1194.6399999999999s)]
*  Mr. Zelensky would go to the White House, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1196.6399999999999s)]
*  that this deal would be signed, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1198.6399999999999s)]
*  and these two leaders could potentially turn the page. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1200.6399999999999s)]
*  And it doesn't really look like that's happened. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1204.6399999999999s)]
*  You only have to look at that image that we've seen. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1206.6399999999999s)]
*  There's a photo going around [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1208.68s)]
*  of the Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1210.68s)]
*  and you can see her very clearly [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1212.68s)]
*  with her head in her hands. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1214.68s)]
*  And I think that really sums up how a lot of people here [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1216.68s)]
*  in Ukraine are feeling [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1218.68s)]
*  about what they've just saw at the White House. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1220.68s)]
*  OK, MTS Tyub, there is that image right there. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1222.68s)]
*  Head in hands, cannot believe what she just saw [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1225.68s)]
*  or what anybody just saw for that matter. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1228.68s)]
*  We're going to continue to cover this. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1230.68s)]
*  As we mentioned, we're expecting [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1232.68s)]
*  President Trump and Ukraine's President Zelensky [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1233.68s)]
*  to hold a joint news conference [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1235.68s)]
*  at some point this afternoon. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1237.72s)]
*  Don't know if it's on or off. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1238.72s)]
*  Expecting it to still be on. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1239.72s)]
*  We'll bring it to you live when it does happen. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1241.72s)]
*  Our coverage will continue on CBS News 24-7, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1243.72s)]
*  your local news, and tonight on the CBS Evening News. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1246.72s)]
*  This has been the CBS News Special Report. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1249.72s)]
*  I'm Luis Dubois. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kegv-0ACAJE&t=1251.72s)]
