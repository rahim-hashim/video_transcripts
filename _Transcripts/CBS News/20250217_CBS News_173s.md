# What to know about Trump effort to fire head of whistleblower agency
**CBS News:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo)
*  All right, the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to allow the firing of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=0.0s)]
*  head of the federal agency dedicated to protecting whistleblowers. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=3.7800000000000002s)]
*  Lower Court had previously blocked the move. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=7.18s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News, Department of Justice reporter Jake Rosen to talk more about this. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=9.22s)]
*  So, Jake, what is the Office of the Special Counsel for our viewers to understand, and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=13.18s)]
*  why is the administration targeting it? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  Well, this is not like the special counsels that we've heard for the last two years who [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=18.26s)]
*  investigated President Donald Trump. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=21.82s)]
*  This is a different office that's more permanent at theâ€”in the government, which basically [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=24.46s)]
*  oversees the potentially illegal firings of workers and protects them and protects [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=28.42s)]
*  whistleblowers and also enforces Hatch Act violations if someone were to make political [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=33.56s)]
*  speech while they're in their official capacity for office. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=38.7s)]
*  You can see why the Trump administration would want to get rid of someone like this, who [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=41.620000000000005s)]
*  especially was appointed under President Biden because of the quick pace that you and Willie [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=44.660000000000004s)]
*  just discussed of firing federal workers and clearing out entire departments of the government [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  if Elon Musk gets his way after some of these court decisions are played out. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=53.260000000000005s)]
*  But this person, Hampton Dellinger, has sued to get his job back. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=57.66s)]
*  He is currently back in the post, and the Trump administration has listened so far to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=61.339999999999996s)]
*  the judge. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=64.94s)]
*  However, we'll see what the Supreme Court decides in terms of what potential presidential [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=65.94s)]
*  and executive branch power Donald Trump can use to fire some of these independent workers. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=69.7s)]
*  As you know, Senator Jamie Raskin, Jake, has said that the Department of Justice made a [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=74.86s)]
*  deeply corrupt bargain in its decision to drop charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=79.42s)]
*  I want to play a little bit of what he said on Face the Nation yesterday. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=85.14s)]
*  This is an outrageous violation of the rules of prosecutors and an offense against due [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=88.5s)]
*  process and a very dangerous first move for the Department of Justice to be making under [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=96.34s)]
*  the Trump people. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=101.46000000000001s)]
*  So Jake, what are you hearing at the DOJ about these resignations that this decision prompted [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=103.46000000000001s)]
*  here in New York, for example, the Southern District? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=109.9s)]
*  Well, morale was already low when Donald Trump came in and New York Attorney General Pam [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=112.58s)]
*  Bondi announced she was going to conduct a weaponization investigation basically across [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=116.94s)]
*  the government to go after whether it's just the FBI agents who investigated January 6th [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=121.41999999999999s)]
*  and see what they did wrong, allegedly, or to go after people like Letitia James, Alvin [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=126.22s)]
*  Bragg, Jack Smith, all of those investigations against Donald Trump. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=130.7s)]
*  The Department of Justice is usually completely independent from the executive branch. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=134.18s)]
*  At least there's no discussion of ongoing casework. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=137.9s)]
*  Obviously, in this case with Mayor Adams, that's not the case. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=140.5s)]
*  We've seen the Trump administration basically hang over these, hanging these charges over [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=142.94s)]
*  Mayor Adams. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=146.9s)]
*  And, you know, morale is low because if they can do this with someone to get him to cooperate [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=147.9s)]
*  with their immigration policies and want him to work with them on these mass deportation [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=152.38s)]
*  efforts, everyone and all these prosecutors will have to be careful about what cases they [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=157.26s)]
*  do going forward, but also what past cases may be forgiven in exchange for potential [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=161.4s)]
*  political favor. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=166.01999999999998s)]
*  All right, Jake Rosen with that deep reporting analysis for us. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=167.66s)]
*  Jake, thank you, my friend. Appreciate it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE_Xc8MhHo&t=170.5s)]
