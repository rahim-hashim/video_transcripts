# European leaders hold summit on Ukraine, U.S. lawmakers react to Trump-Zelenskyy meeting
**CBS News:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ)
*  Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky says he is ready to sign a minerals deal with the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. after the agreement fell through last week following that public dispute between [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  the Ukrainian leader and President Trump inside the Oval Office on Friday. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=10.06s)]
*  The comments came after world leaders gathered in London yesterday for a summit on the war [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=15.06s)]
*  in Ukraine as European leaders seek to shore up support for Kiev. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=19.78s)]
*  We've team coverage this hour of the fallout from the Trump-Zelensky meeting and the next [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=24.78s)]
*  step still ahead. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=29.5s)]
*  Nancy Cordes is standing by this hour outside the White House. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=30.66s)]
*  But let's start in London where Remy Inosincio joins us from just outside the British Parliament. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=34.14s)]
*  Remy, what were the main takeaways from this summit? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=39.74s)]
*  Chanel, good morning. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=43.260000000000005s)]
*  And yes, America's allies are now pushing for some kind of ceasefire plan for Ukraine [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=46.900000000000006s)]
*  in the aftermath of that disastrous White House meeting between President Trump and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=53.22s)]
*  President Zelensky. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=58.1s)]
*  Yesterday, we saw heads of state, presidents and prime ministers, about 18 or so, come [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=59.26s)]
*  here to London in potentially was a kind of optical show of strength for Ukraine. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=65.3s)]
*  For example, we had Emmanuel Macron from France come in, Donald Tusk from Poland, as well [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=71.82000000000001s)]
*  as NATO Secretary General Mark Root and the EU President Ursula von der Leiden. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=78.14s)]
*  And this actually was planned prior to that blow up at the White House. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=83.82s)]
*  But it took on this kind of new sense of urgency. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=87.62s)]
*  And then at the press conference immediately after that two hour meeting with those leaders, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=90.62s)]
*  Prime Minister Keir Starmer said a phrase that has been used ever since he spoke them, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=95.38s)]
*  the coalition of the willing to try to support Ukraine. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=100.82s)]
*  He did not say which countries would in effect ante up more investment, more weapons. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=104.46s)]
*  But he said that we should expect countries to start talking about them very soon. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=110.18s)]
*  He did delineate what the UK could do. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=114.1s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=116.74s)]
*  The UK is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air together [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=117.74s)]
*  with others. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=124.53999999999999s)]
*  Europe must do the heavy listing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=126.38s)]
*  But to support peace in our continent and to succeed, this effort must have strong US [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=129.66s)]
*  backing. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=136.7s)]
*  And some of the takeaways coming out of that summit, Prime Minister Starmer said that there [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=139.78s)]
*  is a new one point six billion pound deal. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=143.3s)]
*  That's about two billion dollars that would help Ukraine buy about five thousand air defense [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=146.66s)]
*  missiles. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=152.18s)]
*  We're seeing aerospace stocks here in the UK jump on that news because of that potential [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=153.18s)]
*  investment. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=158.54s)]
*  Out of Germany, we're seeing media reports of two funds, one for defense and one for [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=159.54s)]
*  infrastructure for Ukraine being talked about with the incoming and the outgoing government [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=164.98000000000002s)]
*  as well. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=169.82s)]
*  It's believed that that defense fund should be on the order of about four hundred billion [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=170.85999999999999s)]
*  dollars. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=176.18s)]
*  And coming out from France, Emmanuel Macron and his government are saying that there is [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=177.18s)]
*  a proposal for at least a temporary one month ceasefire, a partial ceasefire that could [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=181.94s)]
*  see fighting in the air from the sea and on energy infrastructure pause, but not with [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=188.74s)]
*  ground fighting. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=195.01999999999998s)]
*  There is some disagreement, however, and this goes to show that there is still talking [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=196.66s)]
*  going on that's here in the UK. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=200.86s)]
*  The Armed Forces chief says that he doesn't know anything about this plan. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=203.58s)]
*  With that said, Vladimir Zelensky of Ukraine says that he knows what is going on and he [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=207.22s)]
*  has been briefed about that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=211.62s)]
*  OK, and do we have any sense, Remy, of how Russia is responding to all this? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=212.82s)]
*  In a word, Chanel, glee, another word, happiness. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=219.26s)]
*  Medvedev over the weekend after that blow up at the White House said that he called [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=223.22s)]
*  Zelensky a clown and that Trump did what he needed to do, but that the United States needs [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=228.38s)]
*  to do more in order to get to a ceasefire. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=234.1s)]
*  And that was to pull out all funding, all military support for Ukraine. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=237.5s)]
*  Also over the weekend, Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister, said that he thinks the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=242.42000000000002s)]
*  US and Russia are actually more alike than many people might want to admit. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=247.14s)]
*  His words, he said that there is a mutually beneficial outcome if the Trump administration [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=252.61999999999998s)]
*  is able to push Ukraine to come to a deal in its favor. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=259.65999999999997s)]
*  OK, Remy and Asensio in London for us. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=263.21999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=265.5s)]
*  And for more on what's next, CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cortez joins [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=266.94s)]
*  us now from outside the White House. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=271.26s)]
*  Nancy, we heard from some lawmakers over the weekend. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=272.78s)]
*  We'll also hear from Senator Chris Murphy later today. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=275.1s)]
*  But first, let's listen to what Marco Rubio said. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=278.26s)]
*  Everybody's saying security guarantees to secure the peace. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=281.98s)]
*  You first have to have a peace. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=284.54s)]
*  We don't even know if the peace is possible. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=285.94s)]
*  The White House has become an arm of the Kremlin. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=288.06s)]
*  Every single day you hear from the national security adviser, from the president of the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=292.06s)]
*  United States, from his entire national security team, Kremlin talking points. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=295.38s)]
*  And the fact is this, Vladimir Putin is a brutal dictator. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=300.38s)]
*  Russia started this war. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=303.86s)]
*  So Nancy, what are your sources saying about where things stand right now between Trump [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=306.90000000000003s)]
*  and Zelensky? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=310.1s)]
*  I mean, is a deal still possible? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=311.1s)]
*  Well, I asked President Trump directly that question on Friday. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=313.02000000000004s)]
*  I said, what's it going to take to restart these talks with the Ukrainian leader? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=317.02000000000004s)]
*  And he said point blank, Zelensky needs to stop saying Putin this and Putin that, all [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=322.62s)]
*  these negative things about Putin. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=327.5s)]
*  President Trump just doesn't want to hear it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=330.06s)]
*  He wants a quick deal. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=331.98s)]
*  He doesn't want a lot of obstacles. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=333.58s)]
*  He said that Zelensky has to want peace and that all this talk about security guarantees [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=335.53999999999996s)]
*  is pointless when Zelensky himself is not holding all the cards. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=343.06s)]
*  Zelensky said over the weekend he does want peace, but he needs those security guarantees. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=347.62s)]
*  Otherwise, he argues any ceasefire would be pointless. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=352.74s)]
*  So that is the main tension here, Chanel, is the fact that the Ukrainian leader wants [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=356.46s)]
*  to go into peace talks with some kind of guarantee that the U.S. would come in with peacekeeping [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=363.5s)]
*  forces some way to force Putin to hold up his end of the bargain because there is so [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=368.65999999999997s)]
*  much mistrust there. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=377.9s)]
*  And Nancy, we heard what Remy Inosincio was reporting about what European leaders are [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=380.06s)]
*  now doing in response to that meeting on Friday that went awry. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=384.86s)]
*  Has the White House reacted to that? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=389.65999999999997s)]
*  No, they still believe that they are the ones, the only ones who could pull off some kind [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=392.34s)]
*  of negotiation with Putin. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=399.65999999999997s)]
*  In fact, Rubio said that point blank, the only person who can do this is President Trump. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=402.21999999999997s)]
*  And even then, Rubio said it may not be possible, it may not be possible to come to terms with [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=408.14s)]
*  Vladimir Putin, but the only person who has a shot, he argued, is Donald Trump. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=414.02s)]
*  Although what you're hearing from multiple White House officials is if President Trump [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=419.85999999999996s)]
*  is going to stick his neck out for Ukraine, then Ukraine is going to have to play by his [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=425.06s)]
*  rules. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=429.53999999999996s)]
*  And Nancy, I know you have some new reporting this morning about more changes at USAID. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=430.53999999999996s)]
*  Tell us more about that. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=435.29999999999995s)]
*  Sure. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=436.74s)]
*  So what we know is that an acting assistant administrator, his name is Nick Enrich, he's [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=437.74s)]
*  the acting administrator for USAID Global Health, he has been placed on leave, according [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=445.1s)]
*  to a couple of sources. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=453.3s)]
*  And the reason is because he issued a pair of memos on Friday that was critical of the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=455.26s)]
*  political leadership at the State Department. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=462.18s)]
*  One of them, for example, one of these memos was critical of the overall pause on federal [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=467.02000000000004s)]
*  assistance and that obviously did not go over well with Secretary Rubio or other leaders, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=472.62s)]
*  political leaders at the State Department. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=479.90000000000003s)]
*  So he has now been placed on administrative leave. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=481.5s)]
*  Sources tell us that he was put on leave for simply trying to do his job and documenting [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=485.02000000000004s)]
*  all the obstacles they say are being placed in the way of simply administering aid that [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=491.54s)]
*  has already been approved. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=498.02000000000004s)]
*  But clearly the leadership at the State Department felt differently and he is now on leave. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=500.22s)]
*  Okay, Nancy Cortez, thank you. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RelLByyBQ&t=504.5s)]
