# House budget resolution vote expected
**CBS News:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ)
*  All right, a key part of President Trump's legislative agenda, I believe, is what that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=0.0s)]
*  is supposed to say, is expected on the House floor at some point today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=6.12s)]
*  This is a big test for House Speaker Mike Johnson, who will need to bring in members [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=9.5s)]
*  from his own party who may not be on board. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=13.18s)]
*  I'm going to bring in CBS News congressional reporter Torian Small, who's on the Hill for [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=15.0s)]
*  us. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=18.92s)]
*  So, Torian, House Minority Leader Hickey Jeffries is calling this a Republican budget scheme. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=19.92s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=24.76s)]
*  I'm wary of some of the extensive cuts that House Speaker Johnson is looking to undergo [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=27.76s)]
*  as part of this massive budget resolution plan. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=34.72s)]
*  We saw that he announced it would be about $2 trillion in cuts of that, about $800 million [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  â€” $800 million-plus in mandatory spending under the House Energy and Commerce Committee. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=47.56s)]
*  I should note in that panel's purview is Medicaid. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=55.56s)]
*  So Democrats are raising the flag there, saying, listen, this is an about-face from what Republicans [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=59.36s)]
*  talked about on the trail, how they wouldn't be touching Medicaid. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=65.16s)]
*  Now they're saying it's time to reform that program and make some very significant cuts [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  there. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=74.52000000000001s)]
*  We know that this is part of Johnson's plan to offset this massive expansion of the 2017 [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  Rights and Jobs Act. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=82.6s)]
*  That would add about $4.5 trillion to the national deficit. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=83.8s)]
*  Some Republicans, hardline Republicans and physical hearts are saying that that's just [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=89.16s)]
*  not enough. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=94.16s)]
*  More cuts need to be made in order to effectively balance the budget in their minds. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=95.16s)]
*  So as we said, this is a make or break moment for Mike Johnson and his speakership. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=101.28s)]
*  How does he get those Republicans who are on the fence about the budget to rally? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=105.72s)]
*  I mean, he's got to do this, Torian, this week. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=109.08s)]
*  Normally there's a couple more days to sort of whip those votes. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  He's not giving those members time to sort of come to a decision where they might move [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=116.08s)]
*  to his position. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=120.68s)]
*  Yeah, Vlad, not just this week. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=121.68s)]
*  In a matter of hours, we'll see the first procedural vote for this massive budget bill [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=123.72s)]
*  and then ultimately a vote around 6 o'clock this evening. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  Whether or not that goes forward is still TBD because, as we know, leadership is looking [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=132.04s)]
*  to whip up as many votes, especially those on the fence votes, as possible. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=136.8s)]
*  We know in the past couple of hours, people like Representative Victoria Sparks of Indiana, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=142.44s)]
*  Thomas Massey of Kentucky, already announced that they won't be supporting this bill because [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=148.6s)]
*  they think it isn't effective enough, like I just said, in some of the more deep spending [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=153.68s)]
*  cuts that they want to see. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=158.24s)]
*  Chip Roy of Congressmen, a pretty prominent leader on the House Freedom Caucus, also [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=159.68s)]
*  said that he shared some of the same concerns as Sparks and is interested to see where this [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=166.64s)]
*  conversation goes. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=171.04s)]
*  I know that Speaker Johnson has been doing a lot of backdoor conversations and meetings [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=172.11999999999998s)]
*  with some of these on the fence members, including moderates, many of them who had problems [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=177.2s)]
*  with the idea of touching Medicaid, especially after, again, talking about on the trail how [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=181.92s)]
*  they were looking to protect it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=187.2s)]
*  So this is going to be a tough task and a true test of Johnson's leadership. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  We saw him get the job done when it came to his speakership, even though there was a significant [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=193.76s)]
*  pressure campaign mounted against him by some of the more hard-right members. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=198.0s)]
*  Now we'll see whether or not those conversations, those negotiations will pay off for him when [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=202.48s)]
*  it comes time to bring this bill to the floor, Vlad. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=207.48s)]
*  Alright, Torian, small for us. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=210.12s)]
*  Torian, as always, we appreciate it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=211.64s)]
*  We'll be checking with you throughout the day. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRXAByfGMzQ&t=213.04s)]
