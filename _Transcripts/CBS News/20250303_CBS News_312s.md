# Highland Park parade shooter pleads guilty
**CBS News:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0)
*  We want to take you to breaking news now out of Chicago. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=0.0s)]
*  The man accused of killing seven people in Highland Park back in 2022 has pleaded guilty [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=3.0s)]
*  to murder and attempted murder. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=8.16s)]
*  This happened just moments before opening arguments of his trial. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=10.24s)]
*  So here's how CBS New Chicago covered the story just minutes ago. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=13.6s)]
*  It's against the man accused in the 4th of July mass shooting in Highland Park. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=18.28s)]
*  Yeah, a big development here. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=23.68s)]
*  We've just learned that Robert Cremo III is changing his plea in this trial. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  He is now pleading guilty to all murder and attempted murder charges. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=29.98s)]
*  Now he just made this switch minutes before opening arguments were set to start in this [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=33.58s)]
*  trial. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=38.34s)]
*  Cremo III pleading guilty to killing seven people and wounding dozens more in the Highland [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=39.34s)]
*  Park parade shooting back in 2022. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=44.18s)]
*  Now Cremo III was given a plea deal over the summer, but he turned that down. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=46.66s)]
*  He's facing life in prison without the possibility of parole. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=51.5s)]
*  Let's get right to our Sabrina Franza, who was inside the courtroom when that plea deal [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=55.3s)]
*  was switched this morning. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=59.58s)]
*  She is now inside of the Lake County Courthouse. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=60.62s)]
*  Sabrina, good morning to you. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=63.1s)]
*  And what are you expecting? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=64.26s)]
*  What are you waiting for right now? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=65.34s)]
*  Hey, Jackie, I am sitting here right now in the lobby of the courthouse. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=69.46000000000001s)]
*  The reason why things are a little hectic right now is because we're waiting for some [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=73.34s)]
*  of the family members of Robert Cremo III and some of the victims and their families [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=76.7s)]
*  to walk out. So things are a little bit moving here in the lobby of the Lake County [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=81.22s)]
*  Courthouse. But we do know we were in the courtroom watching us. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=85.53999999999999s)]
*  This was unfolding. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=89.26s)]
*  Robert Cremo III has changed his plea. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=91.06s)]
*  It started out as a normal day. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=93.5s)]
*  Everybody was there getting ready for opening statements to begin. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=94.94s)]
*  And instead of that happening, we heard from his attorneys saying that he would be [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=97.54s)]
*  changing his plea. Everything started out normal. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=102.78s)]
*  The judge actually came out and even started doing some homework. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=105.34s)]
*  At the beginning of the hearing today saying that one of the jurors would be excused [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=107.78s)]
*  and replaced with an alternate. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=111.86000000000001s)]
*  As that happened, just making sure that nothing's happening behind us here. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=120.22s)]
*  As that happened, they replaced with the alternate and recessed briefly. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=123.82000000000001s)]
*  It was only 15 minutes into the morning. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=128.62s)]
*  After that, they came back and said that Cremo would be changing his plea from not [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=130.5s)]
*  guilty to guilty. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=135.66s)]
*  He is now considered guilty on all 21 counts of first degree murder and 48 counts of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=137.14000000000001s)]
*  attempted murder. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=142.9s)]
*  And the judge went through the facts of the case. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=144.78s)]
*  He had somebody from the Lake County police go through all of the facts of the case [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=147.74s)]
*  talking and asking Cremo, do you understand what you're doing? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=153.42s)]
*  She asked him repeatedly, are you sure that this is the decision that you're going to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=156.74s)]
*  be making? Were you coerced into this decision? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=160.1s)]
*  And each time he said that no, he was not coerced. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=162.26s)]
*  Yes, he understands. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=165.66s)]
*  And she asked over and over again to make sure that he was positive in his decision [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=167.06s)]
*  to change his plea. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=171.78s)]
*  I'm just going to take a step out of the way for a moment here. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=173.9s)]
*  We're just watching as, like I said, some of the victims and their families are [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=177.66s)]
*  walking out now. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=181.18s)]
*  Their courtroom itself was full of people from the Highland Park community hoping [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=182.9s)]
*  for some sort of closure at the end of this trial, but possibly not expecting it to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=187.70000000000002s)]
*  end in the way that it did this quickly. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=191.86s)]
*  Jury selection took most of last week and they finally had those 12 jurors and six [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=194.46s)]
*  alternates there selected. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=200.02s)]
*  For this trial to begin, everything was going according to plan until today, where [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=202.94s)]
*  things have changed pace, of course. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=208.34s)]
*  And there was even an overflow room set up for some of the folks that were here [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=211.02s)]
*  today. It was a very organized operation, hoping for people who wanted to be here, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=213.58s)]
*  making the space so that they could be here. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=217.62s)]
*  And many people today surprised, hopefully finding some of that closure that they [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=219.74s)]
*  were looking for by this change of decision by Robert Cremo, the third. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=223.78s)]
*  Sabrina, thank you for those updates. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=229.62s)]
*  I'm curious, when he made that change of plea in court, did you hear like any [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=230.98s)]
*  audible response from so many of those victims who were inside the courtroom? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=235.94s)]
*  We actually heard from his mother who was sitting in just the row behind him. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=243.82s)]
*  She stood up and mentioned something pretty loudly about a court order at that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=248.18s)]
*  point. And the judge had said, you know, she said, I don't want to embarrass you. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=252.66s)]
*  This is not allowed in a courtroom. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=258.3s)]
*  And if you cannot maintain composure, you'll be asked to leave. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=260.86s)]
*  At that point, she sat down and maintained her seat. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=263.94s)]
*  But other than that, everything was very eerily calm almost. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=265.78000000000003s)]
*  And every answer that Cremo gave to the questions that the judge was presenting [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=269.42s)]
*  him with were just yes or no, yes or no. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=273.34000000000003s)]
*  Other than that, it was pretty, pretty calm in the courtroom. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=277.34000000000003s)]
*  And Sabrina, one of the things I was just thinking about is you got there this [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=281.66s)]
*  morning, along with some of our other crews that got there. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=284.82s)]
*  And you were expecting... [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=287.62s)]
*  And you were just hearing from Sabrina Franz, a reporter with CBS News Chicago [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=288.62s)]
*  with breaking news on the attacker of the Highland Park shooting that man, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=293.58s)]
*  Robert Cremo, the third, just pleaded guilty to murder and attempted murder. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=298.65999999999997s)]
*  And that was happened in Highland Park during Fourth of July parade. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=303.7s)]
*  Again, Robert Cremo, Jr., the third, pleading guilty. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KpbompfK0&t=308.78s)]
