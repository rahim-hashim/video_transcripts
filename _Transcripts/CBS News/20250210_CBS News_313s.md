# Trump repeats pledge to take control of Gaza
**CBS News:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc)
*  President Trump is doubling down on his pledge for a U.S. takeover of the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=0.0s)]
*  Speaking on board Air Force One yesterday, the president also said some parts of the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=5.5s)]
*  war-torn enclave could be rebuilt by other states in the Middle East. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=10.26s)]
*  Yeah, I think that it's a big mistake to allow people, the Palestinians or the people living [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=14.5s)]
*  in Gaza, to go back yet another time. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=20.6s)]
*  And we don't want Hamas going back. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=23.92s)]
*  Think of it as a big real estate site. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=26.68s)]
*  And the United States is going to own it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=30.16s)]
*  As far as us rebuilding it, we may give it to other states in the Middle East to build [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=32.96s)]
*  sections of it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=37.8s)]
*  Now the president's comments come as Israeli negotiators are in Qatar for talks on the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=39.88s)]
*  next phase of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  Over the weekend, Hamas released three additional hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=48.56s)]
*  But the thin and frail state of the hostages has sparked shock in Israel, with President [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=54.38s)]
*  Trump likening their appearance to Holocaust survivors. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=60.620000000000005s)]
*  For more on the situation in the Middle East, I'm joined now by BBC News correspondent Yolande [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=63.980000000000004s)]
*  Nel. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=68.9s)]
*  Yolande, President Trump repeating his pledge now for a U.S. takeover of Gaza. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=69.9s)]
*  Help us understand the impact these comments are having in the region, especially as the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=74.62s)]
*  negotiations, which are sensitive as they are and delicate, try to move for a second [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=78.68s)]
*  phase of the ceasefire deal. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=83.5s)]
*  Well, I will just to remind people, we're now about halfway through this initial six [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=86.1s)]
*  week stage in the ceasefire. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=92.38s)]
*  And we're supposed to have these talks going on in Qatar, a mediating country, ultimately [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=95.46000000000001s)]
*  about advancing to a second stage. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=100.26s)]
*  That's when we'd see a permanent end to the fighting in Gaza. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=102.62s)]
*  And you'd see the remaining Israeli hostages being brought home. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=106.78s)]
*  Now, President Trump's comments have really changed the context of all of this. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=110.94000000000001s)]
*  You've had the Israeli prime minister embracing them, calling them revolutionary. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=114.74000000000001s)]
*  He's now returned to Israel. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=119.66000000000001s)]
*  He's expected to have quite a key cabinet meeting. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=122.26s)]
*  And the Israeli media are saying that at the moment, his negotiating team in Doha don't [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  really seem to have a mandate to advance. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=131.46s)]
*  And the prime minister has appeared to want to keep the door open for a return to fighting [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=134.3s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=139.36s)]
*  This is something that's really worrying Israeli hostage families who want desperately to get [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=140.4s)]
*  their loved ones home. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=145.36s)]
*  Palestinians and Arab states, of course, have totally rejected President Trump's plan. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  And we've also had Hamas hinting that this could even endanger the current ceasefire [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=151.88000000000002s)]
*  arrangements, saying that Israel's reaction shows a lack of commitment to the ongoing [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=157.4s)]
*  deal. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  And Yolande, some of the freed hostages from the first ceasefire agreement have told CBS [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  News about the psychological and physical torture they went through. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=169.6s)]
*  But now that we're seeing more hostages being released in such delicate physical shape, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=172.96s)]
*  what are we learning about how they were treated? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=178.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, for sure, we all saw that those three men, the latest released, looked emaciated. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=183.36s)]
*  They looked to be in worse physical health than the previous hostages that came out. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=188.32s)]
*  They're said to have been suffering from malnutrition. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=194.6s)]
*  Their family is talking about how they went through physical as well as psychological [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=197.44s)]
*  abuse. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=201.88s)]
*  They needed medical care, but went untreated. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=202.88s)]
*  But we've also had from them the first sign of life of another one of the Israeli hostages, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=205.28s)]
*  the first sign of life in 16 months for his family. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=211.32s)]
*  His name's Alan Ahel. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=214.84s)]
*  Today, he would have been 24 celebrating with his family if he was home with them. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=215.84s)]
*  His mother instead gave a very emotional interview to Israeli TV talking about the desperate [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=221.02s)]
*  need to get him home, saying that he had been wounded on those 7th of October Hamas [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=226.92s)]
*  attacks and had shrapnel injuries and the likes. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=231.72s)]
*  He desperately needed medical care. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  His name is not even on the list of hostages to come out in the first six weeks of the deal. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=237.1s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=241.56s)]
*  And meantime, what's happening in Gaza? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=242.56s)]
*  We know people there are returning to its northern area following the Israeli withdrawal [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=244.06s)]
*  from certain corridors. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=248.76s)]
*  But what are they returning to exactly? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  Well, simply, Errol, near total destruction caused by intense Israeli bombardment over [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=254.0s)]
*  the past 16 months. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=261.88s)]
*  We're continuing to get these scenes of hundreds of Palestinians going, some of them [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=263.2s)]
*  in cars and in carts, to the north of the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=266.88s)]
*  Now that Israel, in accordance with the ceasefire deal, has pulled out of this key military [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=270.96s)]
*  zone basically dividing Gaza into a northern and southern part. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=275.88s)]
*  Now, local journalists who are working with us have been talking to people. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=282.4s)]
*  They continue to express defiance, saying that they want to go back even to the rubble [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=286.8s)]
*  of their homes. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=290.84s)]
*  They will not be moved from there, they say. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=291.84s)]
*  But we're getting humanitarian agencies really drawing attention to the fact that [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=295.36s)]
*  conditions in the north are dire. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=299.96s)]
*  And they're saying that there's nearly a million people who are in need urgently of [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=302.68s)]
*  proper tents and shelters. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=307.36s)]
*  Yolande, now we appreciate your reporting. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=309.32s)]
*  Joining us from Jerusalem. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lKlDVNFfc&t=311.64s)]
