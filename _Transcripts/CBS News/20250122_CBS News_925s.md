# Hughes Fire burning more than 5,000 acres in Southern California
**CBS News:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY)
*  I'm Lindsay Reiser. It's four o'clock here in New York, 1 p.m. in California, where a new wildfire has developed in Los Angeles County. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=0.0s)]
*  We take you now to CBS News Los Angeles' live coverage of that fire. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=7.0s)]
*  ...here looking very, very crowded as people appear to be heeding the warnings. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=11.0s)]
*  If they haven't checked their apps or their news apps or gotten an alert, they may just see the loom up that is to the north of them and realize that this is a major brush fire in Southern California again [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=15.0s)]
*  and that now it's affecting their community and they need to pack up and leave. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=26.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think there was kind of a sigh of relief when we heard that there was rain in the forecast this weekend. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=29.0s)]
*  We heard that the winds would not be quite as strong and I think people, at least in some areas, thought they could kind of somewhat let their guard down. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=34.0s)]
*  And then we saw this just explode. And also when you see this wider angle, you see how dry the conditions are there. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=42.0s)]
*  There's just like no green. It's just all brown and so dry. And look how massive this is right now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=48.0s)]
*  You can also see how few roads and arteries there are around this fire in terms of access for firefighters and roads for people to be able to get out. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=54.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is remarkable to see how much smoke there is in the area. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=63.0s)]
*  And our meteorologist Paul Deanna was talking about the wind conditions. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=70.0s)]
*  And originally we were hearing they were around 32 and he let us know that in this area they were more at 35 and 39 and they were expecting the winds to pick up. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=74.0s)]
*  I don't know if Paul can hear me now, but you know, so often we talk about those sundowner winds as the winds pick up as evening comes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=84.0s)]
*  But, you know, we are going to see stronger winds in this area as the day progresses, Paul. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=91.0s)]
*  Sorry, Paul's not there. But Mark, we do often see, you know, these sundowner winds and the winds picking up in these areas. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=97.0s)]
*  I know they're very prevalent in Simi Valley areas and I believe in this area as well. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=105.0s)]
*  As the evening starts to come, we will get more winds, right, Paul? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=110.0s)]
*  We will. What we're going to see is we're going to see kind of like a wave coming up and down during the day. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=114.0s)]
*  The winds get a bit stronger in the evening. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=119.0s)]
*  The overall theme of this is going to be one of our windier spots. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=122.0s)]
*  That's going to continue for the next 24 hours. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=127.0s)]
*  I expect winds to be at least 20 miles per hour in this area through tomorrow afternoon, tomorrow evening. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=129.0s)]
*  We kind of hit our peak of the winds for the day about an hour ago. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=135.0s)]
*  We can switch over to our weather maps if there's any if there's a very, very, very thin amount of good news with a fire that's spreading toward a populated area. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=138.0s)]
*  It's that the winds were in the last hour up to about 40 miles per hour. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=148.0s)]
*  And right now they're down to about 31 to 33 miles per hour. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=152.0s)]
*  That said, that's about the speed through a neighborhood. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=156.0s)]
*  Think about driving your car through a neighborhood. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=160.0s)]
*  Maybe you're not moving terribly fast, but you're still moving at a pretty good rate. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=162.0s)]
*  It's faster than you could ever go on a bicycle. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=166.0s)]
*  So that's the speed that some of the smoke is moving. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=168.0s)]
*  That's the speed that potentially some of the embers are moving. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=171.0s)]
*  And that's the speed of wind that all these brave men and women who are flying the planes and helicopters are having to deal with as well. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=175.0s)]
*  So the wind is not as bad as yesterday, certainly not as bad as last week or the week before, but it is bone dry air. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=182.0s)]
*  And we are still looking at wind gusts right now, anywhere from 31 to 33 miles per hour, specifically zooming into Castaic Lake. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=190.0s)]
*  Temperatures around 70. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=197.0s)]
*  It's a warm day out there. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=198.0s)]
*  Even in the mountains, it's about 70 degrees. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=199.0s)]
*  And the winds are pushing the fire to the south and west. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=201.0s)]
*  That's why when we have a fire burning in an area where there aren't many people living, but downwind of there, we have significant communities. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=204.0s)]
*  You can see the neighborhoods right there and then just to the west of the five and right along the five, just to the south of the lake, a lot of neighborhoods there. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=213.0s)]
*  And that's the direction that the wind is pushing this fire right now. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=221.0s)]
*  I'm going to step off screen and show you our downtown Los Angeles camera because a number of people may be familiarizing themselves with this fire because of the smoke plume that you can see. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=225.0s)]
*  And we have gone almost completely cloudy over the Hollywood Hills and points to the west in western L.A. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=236.0s)]
*  County and eastern Ventura County because that smoke plume is pushing the smoke over places like Camarillo, over places like Agoura Hills, probably stretching now all the way out toward Malibu. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=244.0s)]
*  So even if you're 40, 50, 60 miles away from this fire, you are being impacted by it because now it looks like a cloudy day. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=254.0s)]
*  Those aren't clouds. That's smoke. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=263.0s)]
*  Now we've talked about how dry it is for November. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=266.0s)]
*  We average about an inch of rainfall and about one fifth of that December. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=269.0s)]
*  We barely got nothing. And in January, we have received nothing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=272.0s)]
*  So we are talking about the driest start to a winter that we have ever had. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=276.0s)]
*  We've had two one hundredths of an inch of rain from the first of December through today. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=282.0s)]
*  So 20 seconds, we're talking about 53 days. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=286.0s)]
*  We've had one fiftieth of one inch of rainfall. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=289.0s)]
*  That is not much. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=292.0s)]
*  So we combine the dry conditions with the very dry and very low relative humidity. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=294.0s)]
*  I'll switch over to that map now. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=299.0s)]
*  Look at these relative humidity numbers. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=301.0s)]
*  This is drier than Phoenix. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=302.0s)]
*  Phoenix is not as dry as we are right here. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=305.0s)]
*  Chino, four percent relative humidity. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=308.0s)]
*  Santa Clarita, seven percent relative humidity. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=310.0s)]
*  Burbank, eight percent relative humidity. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=313.0s)]
*  And downtown Los Angeles, nine percent relative humidity. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=315.0s)]
*  So we're talking about very dry air. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=318.0s)]
*  The ground is completely parched. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=321.0s)]
*  And I'll switch back over to our wind map. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=324.0s)]
*  The final piece of the puzzle here would be the 30 to 33 mile per hour winds that are blowing. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=326.0s)]
*  It's kind of a one, two, three punch or maybe four or five. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=331.0s)]
*  How many weather elements you want to throw wind there? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=334.0s)]
*  None of them are favorable for fighting a fire. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=336.0s)]
*  All of them make this that much harder. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=338.0s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=340.0s)]
*  All right, Paul, thank you. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=341.0s)]
*  And if you're just joining us in the one o'clock hour, we are continuing to follow breaking news. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=343.0s)]
*  What you're looking at is the Hughes fire that broke out at 10 42 this morning. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=348.0s)]
*  We are learning that this fire has now grown to five thousand acres. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=353.0s)]
*  And we do know that there are a number of evacuation orders and warnings that are underway in the communities surrounding the Casteak area. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=358.0s)]
*  Smoke can be seen as far as Camarillo. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=367.0s)]
*  We are hearing from people in Oak Park and Agora that have also reported smoke in their areas as well. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=370.0s)]
*  Joining us on the phone now is Scott Epstein with the AQMD or the Air Quality Management District. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=377.0s)]
*  Scott, we've been dealing with so much smoke from the previous fires. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=383.0s)]
*  And now we have even more smoke coming from another direction. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=388.0s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for having me here. Yeah, it's really unfortunate. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=393.0s)]
*  We thought we were going to get a break, but more smoke. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=396.0s)]
*  Yeah. And and Scott, I mean, how dangerous is this for folks? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=399.0s)]
*  I heard from one of our viewers, Patricia Mike, who's in Camarillo. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=404.0s)]
*  She has asthma and she was saying that it was tough for her to breathe in Camarillo. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=408.0s)]
*  So this is many miles away. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=413.0s)]
*  So I can only imagine for people that are in the Casteak area what they're dealing with right now, because this fire is really putting off a lot of smoke. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=415.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=423.0s)]
*  So breathing smoke is harmful to everybody. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=424.0s)]
*  But people that have insensitive groups such as children, older adults, pregnant women, people with preexisting heart and lung issues like asthma, like you said, are especially vulnerable. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=428.0s)]
*  And it's even more important that they take precautions to avoid breathing in that smoke. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=438.0s)]
*  And joining us now as well is our Juan Fernandez as we continue to follow this breaking news of the Hughes fire. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=444.0s)]
*  And, you know, Scott, what advice are you having for people in this area? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=452.0s)]
*  I mean, you want to tell them to stay indoors, but if they're being evacuated right now, they've got to get out. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=457.0s)]
*  So what what can they do? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=462.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. So if you're being evacuated, by all means, get out. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=464.0s)]
*  If you're not in evacuation zone and you can stay inside, keep your windows and doors closed, run your HVAC fan and or an air purifier and avoid using things that bring outside air inside. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=469.0s)]
*  Such as a whole house fan or a swamp cooler. If you have to be outside, an N95 mask can provide some protection if it fits well. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=481.0s)]
*  And also you want to avoid doing any heavy outdoor exertion because you end up breathing in more pollution when you do that. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=490.0s)]
*  And the best thing to do is just be aware of your air quality conditions. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=496.0s)]
*  So you want to check the air quality measurements with either the South Coast AQMD app or AQMD.gov. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=500.0s)]
*  That's if you're in L.A. County. If you're in Ventura County, you want to go to air now dot gov. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=507.0s)]
*  Also, smell for smoke and look for ash. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=513.0s)]
*  And if your AQI is high, if you smell smoke or you see ash, you want to take precautions to avoid breathing that pollution in. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=516.0s)]
*  All right, Scott Epstein, thank you so much for joining us this afternoon to give some really helpful advice for those who may be dealing with this smoke. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=524.0s)]
*  We were also showing our viewers a live look at Castaic High School that is being evacuated. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=533.0s)]
*  We were talking to families. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=539.0s)]
*  Amanda Starrantino was talking to families a little earlier. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=542.0s)]
*  The families were evacuating, getting their kids out of the elementary school. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=545.0s)]
*  And now we're also hearing about the high school and going back to the smoke and the danger of it just driving in today. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=548.0s)]
*  You can see the smoke even hovering over Studio City. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=553.0s)]
*  A friend of mine also reached out who lives in North Hollywood. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=556.0s)]
*  He has a N95 mask on inside his house because he is feeling the effects of it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=558.0s)]
*  So make sure you keep your windows closed, run the A.C. if you need to and be as safe as possible. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=563.0s)]
*  All right. Speaking of Amanda Starrantino, let's go back to her now. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=569.0s)]
*  She is live at Ridge Route Road with the very latest from there, Amanda. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=572.0s)]
*  Hey, guys, it's a very hectic scene over here that you can see the fire right over this way. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=579.0s)]
*  This is where it's burning. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=585.0s)]
*  The fire department asked me not to go any further. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=586.0s)]
*  I'm going to take my IP out because I'm getting some feedback from you guys. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=589.0s)]
*  OK, so what you can see is a lot of L.A. County Fire Department is out here. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=594.0s)]
*  What they're doing right now is watching those flames. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=598.0s)]
*  They're right on the other side of this ridge. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=601.0s)]
*  They're concerned this wind is blowing southwest. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=603.0s)]
*  So we are right alongside the five freeway. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=606.0s)]
*  We are east of the five right past Lake Hughes Parkway. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=608.0s)]
*  What this fire department, this fire crews doing right here? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=612.0s)]
*  They're watching for any hot spots if that flames are going to go over. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=615.0s)]
*  They have eyes up all down right here. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=618.0s)]
*  We're right along Ridge Road. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=620.0s)]
*  You can see the five to the right and they're making sure that that fire doesn't go. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=621.0s)]
*  But they're ready to go. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=626.0s)]
*  The problem here, though, is in this spot where they're watching these flames come over, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=627.0s)]
*  they have just a little bit of water in these tanks. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=632.0s)]
*  Look at this massive tank right here. It has no water. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=634.0s)]
*  It's under construction. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=637.0s)]
*  So that's what they're very concerned about right now, that this thing has no water for them to fight that fire. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=638.0s)]
*  They are relying on air dropping, water dropping aircraft at this point. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=643.0s)]
*  But all these guys out here, they all have eyes on those flames, making sure this ridge line is staying clear. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=648.0s)]
*  But that fire is back behind us, east of us right now. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=653.0s)]
*  But the concern is, Suzanne, if you can turn around, you can see if that fire goes, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=657.0s)]
*  there's all this hillside that is all dry with a lot of brush. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=662.0s)]
*  And we can see all those homes right across the five freeway. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=666.0s)]
*  So we're crossing Ridge Route Road right now, and this is just past the fire. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=669.0s)]
*  But you can see right over here, all these homes in this area, which have been, they are under an evacuation order. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=674.0s)]
*  But these guys, keeping an eye if those flames go over because the five freeway is right here. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=681.0s)]
*  And that could cause a lot of problems because you can see just how much vegetation and brushes across there. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=686.0s)]
*  So right across me, if we go down this way, this is going to be going on the five south, going this direction. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=690.0s)]
*  This is which way the wind is blowing by how you can tell in my hair, hair blowing with the wind. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=696.0s)]
*  So we're talking about these neighborhoods all right here. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=701.0s)]
*  Lakeview, we got Lakeview over there. We have Hillcrest. We have Hasley Canyon. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=703.0s)]
*  That's the direction this fire is going. You are under an order and you need to go in the Castaic Lake area as well. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=708.0s)]
*  All those schools have been evacuated. So that is some good news there that all those kids are out of there. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=713.0s)]
*  We just came from the Castaic Recreation Area. A lot of people have left in about an hour. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=718.0s)]
*  The fire went from a very hectic, crazy scene there. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=724.0s)]
*  The roads were packed to a very quiet area with just first responders. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=727.0s)]
*  So it sounds like a lot of people packed up quickly to go. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=731.0s)]
*  But again, fire crews watching that fire line right now and making sure that no hot spots come across this area. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=734.0s)]
*  None of them can talk to me on camera here. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=739.0s)]
*  But what I am being told is that they are just keeping an eye on these flames, making sure it's not going. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=741.0s)]
*  But they say it's moving very, very rapidly. This thing is moving fast. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=746.0s)]
*  I mean, actually, just look at it. You can see these pink strands right here. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=750.0s)]
*  Just how strong this wind is blowing and which direction it is going. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=754.0s)]
*  I mean, this is a great wind gauge for us right here for you to see. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=757.0s)]
*  And that's the direction that fire is going right now across all these hillsides. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=760.0s)]
*  So right now, not directly impacting homes, but it very well could very, very quickly when this wind picks up. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=764.0s)]
*  I'm going to put my IP back in so you guys can so I can hear what you guys are saying. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=771.0s)]
*  But I can hear you guys now. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=775.0s)]
*  All right, Amanda, it looks like we have these units here. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=777.0s)]
*  They're kind of staged right now looking to see where the fire is headed next. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=780.0s)]
*  And the good news is, too, is that a lot of these units were pre-stationed, right? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=784.0s)]
*  Amy, overnight, knowing that these fires would be happening. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=790.0s)]
*  I think we lost communications with Amanda. Is that right? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=793.0s)]
*  Oh, no, I'm still here. I can hear you. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=797.0s)]
*  Great, great, great. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=799.0s)]
*  And the good thing, though, Amanda, is that while that tank may be under construction, they've got to stay alake. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=800.0s)]
*  They have water resources that they are using because there are a number of aircraft out there. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=805.0s)]
*  I believe it was something like maybe six or seven helicopters and eight fixed wings, I believe. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=811.0s)]
*  Really, so many resources were in the area because of the other fires. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=816.0s)]
*  Did the firefighter want to say something to you, Amanda? Are you in a bad situation now? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=821.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no one can talk on camera here. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=827.0s)]
*  But what I can say is through conversations that I'm having here is this fire is moving very rapidly. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=831.0s)]
*  But again, their concern is that these trucks here only have so much water, and that's what they're going to have to fight if that fire does come this way. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=836.0s)]
*  So that's why they're keeping all eyes on it to see if they need to route some of those air, water dropping aircraft to this area. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=844.0s)]
*  So I will say I actually talked to this department just two days ago anticipating these winds coming through, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=851.0s)]
*  and they had hundreds of extra firefighters prepared that were sent out that were here ready to go. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=858.0s)]
*  Different strike teams ready to go as well. So they were prepared for this to happen. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=865.0s)]
*  We have been thinking this would probably happen with the winds that we have seen. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=870.0s)]
*  It's surprising to see that this area has been spared until this time. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=874.0s)]
*  But a lot of this area had a long time to prepare with those winds that we've had in this area. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=878.0s)]
*  So if you guys can fix my feedback, I'm getting a lot of feedback, so it's hard for me to talk back to you guys. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=885.0s)]
*  But you can see right here we have Santa Clarita Valley water is coming in this way as well. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=891.0s)]
*  We've been listening to CBS News Los Angeles is live coverage of a fast moving new wildfire that has broken out in southern California. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=895.0s)]
*  The Hughes Fire is burning near Santa Clarita in northern Los Angeles. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=902.0s)]
*  The flames have already burned more than 5000 acres so far. At this hour, it is zero percent contained. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=907.0s)]
*  Authorities have ordered mandatory evacuations in the area. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=913.0s)]
*  And there are road closures as well. We will continue to monitor this fire. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=916.0s)]
*  We will bring you more after a break. You're watching CBS News 24 7. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD5FADqnUY&t=921.0s)]
