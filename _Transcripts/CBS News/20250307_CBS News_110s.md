*  The White House has made it clear President Trump has had enough after he issued an ultimatum [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0EDTn7_KdY&t=17.72s)]
*  to Hamas and the entire population of Gaza to release the hostages or face destruction. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0EDTn7_KdY&t=23.6s)]
*  Pressed on exactly what this means, special envoy Steve Witkoff said it was unclear but [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0EDTn7_KdY&t=30.44s)]
*  did not rule out joint action with the Israelis. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0EDTn7_KdY&t=36.760000000000005s)]

*  But a senior Hamas official, Moshir al-Masri, said they have no intention of leaving and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0EDTn7_KdY&t=46.08s)]
*  while they don't want to rule Gaza after the war, they will not put down their weapons [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0EDTn7_KdY&t=52.04s)]
*  until there is a Palestinian state. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0EDTn7_KdY&t=57.12s)]
*  He insisted the only way to free the remaining hostages is through negotiations to end the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0EDTn7_KdY&t=59.96s)]
*  war. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0EDTn7_KdY&t=65.88s)]
*  The uncertainty has left many hostage families raging against their Prime Minister, Benjamin [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0EDTn7_KdY&t=66.88s)]
*  Netanyahu, whom they blame for failed peace talks. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0EDTn7_KdY&t=71.68s)]

*  In Gaza, despair has replaced the relief over the initial ceasefire. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0EDTn7_KdY&t=88.68s)]
*  Israel has blocked all aid to the more than two million Palestinians living there. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0EDTn7_KdY&t=93.64s)]
*  Most cannot survive without it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0EDTn7_KdY&t=99.0s)]
*  And Whitcoff has said he will visit the region next week with stops planned in four countries. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0EDTn7_KdY&t=101.86s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0EDTn7_KdY&t=107.9s)]
*  Alright Deborah, thank you for that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0EDTn7_KdY&t=108.9s)]
