# Latest weather forecast as California families seek those missing in wildfire rubble
**CBS News:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI)
*  Firefighters are facing a new wildfire that you see here in Ventura County, California. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=0.0s)]
*  The auto fire began last night, forcing more evacuations. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=5.9s)]
*  This makes four major wildfires we are tracking in the Los Angeles area. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=10.1s)]
*  Officials say the Eaton Fire is now 35% contained. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=14.780000000000001s)]
*  The Palisades Fire is still only 17% contained. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=19.02s)]
*  The Hearst Fire, on the other hand, is nearing 100% containment. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=22.72s)]
*  The Santa Ana winds are picking up again today as particularly dangerous situation red flag [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=26.74s)]
*  warnings when they reflect this morning and are projected to last through tomorrow. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=31.82s)]
*  Wind gusts today have been so far as high as 74 miles an hour. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=36.099999999999994s)]
*  Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass outlined what fire crews told her after an aerial tour yesterday. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=40.26s)]
*  I had an opportunity to speak to the firefighters, including our chief. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=46.14s)]
*  Firefighters who've been on the job for 25, 30 years to say to me that in their entire careers, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=52.06s)]
*  they have never seen destruction like this. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=61.02s)]
*  They have never seen wind so fierce. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=65.06s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News correspondent Adam Yamaguchi from the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=69.94s)]
*  about 20 miles west of downtown Los Angeles, Adam. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=73.74000000000001s)]
*  We see just rubble behind you. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=76.30000000000001s)]
*  What does the destruction look like where you are? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=78.42s)]
*  You know, Lindsay, you start to run out of words to describe just the enormity of this [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=82.62s)]
*  destruction everywhere around us. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=89.42s)]
*  This is just a small approximation. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=91.42s)]
*  This is repeated over and over, block after block. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=93.86s)]
*  As we drive around, you know, you circle a bend and you think, OK, maybe this is all [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=96.9s)]
*  over and you see another neighborhood that's just been leveled. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=100.58s)]
*  So the devastation is just, again, it is indescribable at this point. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=104.22s)]
*  Meanwhile, as you mentioned, we're certainly not out of the we're not in the clear yet. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=109.53999999999999s)]
*  The National Weather Service has issued its highest level warning, a particularly dangerous [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=114.58s)]
*  situation that is going to continue through midday tomorrow afternoon. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=120.06s)]
*  We are expecting some of the winds to pick back up later this afternoon and into the evening. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=125.14s)]
*  So people are bracing themselves for, again, that particularly dangerous situation that may [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=130.66s)]
*  yet arise. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=137.62s)]
*  I want to ask you what you're seeing in terms of the winds and what you're hearing from [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=139.5s)]
*  firefighters about how the next few days could go, how crucial they are and what the winds [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=144.34s)]
*  are expected to do and how that could hamper their efforts. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=148.94s)]
*  Yeah, right now, at least where we are here, it's it's pretty quiet. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=153.26000000000002s)]
*  The winds are I'm not really picking up any winds here. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=157.70000000000002s)]
*  But again, officials throughout the region have cautioned residents and beyond in this [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=161.26s)]
*  neighborhood and beyond that we are not in the clear yet. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=168.46s)]
*  These fires can pick up at any moment. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=171.78s)]
*  So they are they are asking everyone to exercise vigilance. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=175.14s)]
*  Meanwhile, I'm just looking right across the street from me here. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=178.98s)]
*  A number of police officers and search and rescue teams have descended upon a property [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=182.3s)]
*  out here. So those search and rescues are continuing. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=187.22s)]
*  In this neighborhood and in the Eaton Canyon area as well. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=191.26s)]
*  Meanwhile, firefighters are still continuing to build that containment. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=194.82s)]
*  As you mentioned earlier, we are at about 17 percent here, 35 percent in Eaton County, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=199.34s)]
*  but in Canyon. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=203.86s)]
*  But again, with the with the winds expected to pick back up, these these fires can flare [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=205.57999999999998s)]
*  up really at any moment. So people are are high alert. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=211.78s)]
*  Adam, yeah, Maguchi, thank you. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=214.9s)]
*  And you can see the red flag warnings in the area around Los Angeles here on our radar [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=216.18s)]
*  showing the dangerous areas where the winds can reignite and spread flames. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=222.3s)]
*  And as you see here in our fire weather outlook, the extreme conditions around the L.A. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=226.02s)]
*  area, they are around that area. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=229.94s)]
*  There are high risks, though, all over Southern California. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=232.26000000000002s)]
*  CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Grant Gilmore is tracking that for us. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=235.26000000000002s)]
*  Hey, Grant, those Santa Ana winds have been picking up once again today and we'll really [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=238.74s)]
*  be keeping a close eye on those conditions as we go through the rest of the afternoon. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=244.06s)]
*  So far today's here, some of the wind gusts that we've seen reported Magic Mountain right [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=248.74s)]
*  around 74 mile per hour gusts. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=253.66s)]
*  That's pretty high, but that's sort of the exception. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=255.78s)]
*  We've seen more of a 40 to 50 mile per hour gust average around the region, but we could [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=257.82s)]
*  still see some of those gusts up around 60 to 70 miles per hour with those gusty conditions, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=263.76s)]
*  in the dry conditions on the ground. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=270.46s)]
*  Red flag warnings in effect through tomorrow evening with a particularly dangerous situation. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=272.62s)]
*  Red flag warning for Los Angeles and Ventura County due to those exceptionally gusty conditions [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=279.14s)]
*  along with that really low humidity, five to 10 percent relative humidity today. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=285.53999999999996s)]
*  And then the dry conditions on the ground is producing an extreme fire danger today [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=291.41999999999996s)]
*  just north of L.A. up towards Santa Clarita. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=296.82s)]
*  Really concerning conditions as we go through the rest of the day today. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=300.06s)]
*  And then into tomorrow, we'll have to still watch. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=303.02s)]
*  There is that critical fire danger still in place tomorrow all throughout Southern California [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=305.66s)]
*  with those gusty conditions, low humidity, dry conditions, and that's going to be a concern. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=310.78000000000003s)]
*  Look at these gusts as we go through the rest of the afternoon today, potentially 60 to 70 [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=316.66s)]
*  miles per hour. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=321.34000000000003s)]
*  Really not going to be until tomorrow night until those winds begin to relax. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=322.34s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=326.73999999999995s)]
*  Grant, thank you. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKWUUI6EgCI&t=327.73999999999995s)]
