# Justice Department, FBI bracing for more firings amid Trump changes
**CBS News:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70)
*  More shakeups, as you heard from Nicole, are expected at the Department of Justice. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=0.0s)]
*  Today begins Pam Bondi's first full week as U.S. attorney general, and it's expected [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  to come with some new policies and initiatives to revamp the department. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=7.7s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News Department of Justice correspondent Scott McFarland. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=11.0s)]
*  Scott, the FBI has already seen a slew of potential layoffs. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=15.4s)]
*  What more could we see before Cash Patel, should he be confirmed, takes over as director? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=19.36s)]
*  This Monday begins a very destabilizing week, potentially inside the FBI. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Not just that there's this threat or prospect of mass firings or forced resignations. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  It's that nobody has any sense as to when they could happen. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=37.84s)]
*  So one agent told us the agents are checking their email regularly, every few minutes, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=40.72s)]
*  to see if that's the moment they get put on leave toward a possible firing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=46.24s)]
*  That is a distracting way to do your job, and you certainly don't want FBI agents who [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  not chase terrorists for a living to be terribly distracted. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=55.56s)]
*  Pam Bondi entered this office as the nation's attorney general last week with a bit of shock [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=59.04s)]
*  and awe, Vlad. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=63.24s)]
*  This series of new policies and orders from reinstituting the pursuit of the death penalty [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=64.4s)]
*  in federal criminal cases to reallocating resources from the Foreign Influence Task [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=69.9s)]
*  Force, which is supposed to stop foreign countries from influencing U.S. government operations, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=75.16s)]
*  putting them on duties to pursue drug cartels. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=80.0s)]
*  Lots of shifts happening. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  We'd expect more of those in the coming days and weeks as the new leadership of the Department [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=85.28s)]
*  of Justice starts getting its roots in the ground and starts taking over more and more [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=89.8s)]
*  of the operation. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=93.64s)]
*  So as you know, the Department of Justice is trying to restore Elon Musk's allies and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=95.68s)]
*  give them access to Treasury payment systems. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=101.56s)]
*  Why are they trying to gain access, and how is that going to play out in court? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=105.12s)]
*  Now that the Department of Justice is overseen by Trump appointees, they are now taking the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=109.76s)]
*  position of supporting Elon Musk in his efforts. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=113.92s)]
*  The prior Department of Justice may have tried to stop somebody from getting access to Treasury [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=116.92s)]
*  payment systems for those who have unclear tethers to the government. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=121.56s)]
*  That notwithstanding, that's one of a few dozen legal cases that have popped up already. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  There'll be many more legal challenges to what Elon Musk, this Doge operation and the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=131.92s)]
*  Trump team are trying to do. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  The Department of Justice is now serving as their lawyers in court, trying to help Elon [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=138.06s)]
*  Musk along. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=142.28s)]
*  What does he want with access to Treasury payment information, the thing that gets checks [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=143.58s)]
*  out to Americans? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=148.02s)]
*  The argument the Trump administration is making, glad, is they're looking for waste, fraud [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=149.18s)]
*  and abuse. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=153.14000000000001s)]
*  And the best way to find that is getting into the systems themselves. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=154.26000000000002s)]
*  All right, Scott McFarlane reporting for us from Washington. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=157.10000000000002s)]
*  Scott, thank you, my friend. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=160.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4t0NTIAB70&t=161.74s)]
