*  Only the second president in history to serve non-consecutive terms. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnY60lB61Y0&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  Sworn in on the Bible given to him by his mother and the Lincoln Bible. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnY60lB61Y0&t=215.95999999999998s)]
*  Congratulated by his family and friends. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnY60lB61Y0&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  Oh you noticed the little scrambling there of the family to get up there [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnY60lB61Y0&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  and they moved a couple of the music numbers later to get this done [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnY60lB61Y0&t=232.16s)]
*  as close to noon as they possibly could. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnY60lB61Y0&t=237.16s)]
*  About 20 minutes behind on the regular schedule but they repositioned [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnY60lB61Y0&t=240.16s)]
*  I don't know that it's absolutely essential but certainly traditional to get that done at noon. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnY60lB61Y0&t=245.16s)]
*  And because of that we're not sure what's next. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnY60lB61Y0&t=250.16s)]
*  We don't know if it's the end. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnY60lB61Y0&t=253.16s)]
*  A fitting way to start the Trump administration. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnY60lB61Y0&t=255.16s)]
*  Because the schedule has been changed around a little bit. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnY60lB61Y0&t=258.16s)]
