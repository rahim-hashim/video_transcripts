# Latest news on D.C. plane crash as Trump blames DEI policies
**CBS News:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU)
*  Welcome in on this Thursday. I'm Elizabeth Cook on all of our minds today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=0.0s)]
*  The tragic news of that plane and helicopter crash near Washington D. C. We [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=4.2s)]
*  heard from officials earlier today with an update. Take a listen. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  We're now at a point where we're switching from a rescue operation to a [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  recovery operation. Um, at this point, we don't believe there are any [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=17.18s)]
*  survivors from this accident. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=21.28s)]
*  Now this investigation now in full force as officials work to uncover how [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=24.44s)]
*  this happened. You're looking at the search for debris that will help could [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=29.32s)]
*  help answer those questions and of course recover the victims of those [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=34.24s)]
*  aboard both aircrafts. Now this deadly plane crash near Reagan National [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=38.92s)]
*  Airport marks the first major U. S. Commercial aircraft accident in over a [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=42.68s)]
*  decade. So this is what we know so far about the moments leading up to the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=48.28s)]
*  crash. Both the American Airlines flight and the military Black Hawk [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=51.96s)]
*  helicopter were flying standard flight patterns before the collision. The [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=56.28s)]
*  crash happened above the Potomac River last night at 8 48 Eastern time as the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=60.5s)]
*  American flight approached Reagan National Airport for landing and a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=65.84s)]
*  warning for you at home. We're about to show you the moment of impact. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  And just moments ago, we got this video of the moment the plane and the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=78.84s)]
*  helicopter collided. You can see that happened right the top right corner of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=82.52s)]
*  your screen. That ball of flames you see there 60 passengers and four crew [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=87.56s)]
*  members were on board the American Airlines flight 53 42 from Wichita to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=92.52s)]
*  Washington. The Black Hawk helicopter was in the process of training a crew [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  of three people. Those crew members were experienced pilots. CBS News also [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  learned they were wearing night vision goggles during that flight. At least 30 [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  bodies have been recovered so far from the Potomac River by search and rescue [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=111.7s)]
*  teams. And as we mentioned earlier, officials believe there are no [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=115.34s)]
*  survivors from this crash. CBS News has not yet confirmed all the people on [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=118.61999999999999s)]
*  that flight, but the families of those passengers have been notified. At least [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=123.58s)]
*  one black box was also recovered from the river. We want to play the moment [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=128.5s)]
*  air traffic control spotted the collision before alerting authorities. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=132.94s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=137.22s)]
*  American 473 Washington 1 star. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=138.86s)]
*  How do you see that? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=142.66000000000003s)]
*  American 31 30 go around some lip in 250 Clementine 3000. I don't know if [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=144.66000000000003s)]
*  you caught earlier would happen, but there was a collision on the impression [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=149.02s)]
*  of three. We're gonna be shutting down operations for the indefinite future. If [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=153.9s)]
*  you want to go back to the gate, I suggest you guys coordinate with company. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=158.46s)]
*  Let me know what you want to do. All right, we'll let the company talk to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=161.5s)]
*  them right now. Yeah, we we witnessed the whole thing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=164.58s)]
*  No officials at the scene say three debris fields were identified and are [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=168.06s)]
*  actively actively being searched right now. The plane broke into multiple [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=171.98000000000002s)]
*  pieces following the moment of impact. The helicopter remained mostly intact [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=176.62s)]
*  upon the arrival of the recovery team, despite being upside down in the water. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=181.58s)]
*  We're told and just moments ago, President Trump addressed the nation to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=186.3s)]
*  offer his condolences to the families of those victims. Take a listen. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=189.86s)]
*  This was a dark and excruciating night in our nation's capital than in our [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=194.86s)]
*  nation's history and a tragedy of terrible proportions. As one nation, we [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=199.54000000000002s)]
*  grieve for every precious soul that has been taken from us so suddenly, and we [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=205.70000000000002s)]
*  are a country of really we are in mourning. This is really shaking a lot [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=213.14000000000001s)]
*  of people, including people very sadly from other nations who were on the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=218.74s)]
*  flight for the family members back in Wichita, Kansas, here in Washington, D. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=222.86s)]
*  C. And throughout the United States and in Russia, we have a Russia contingent [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=228.46s)]
*  of very talented people. Unfortunately, we're on that plane very, very, very [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=235.18s)]
*  sorry about that, whose loved ones were aboard the passenger jet. We can only [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=239.18s)]
*  begin to imagine the agony that you're all feeling. Nothing worse. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=244.3s)]
*  On behalf of the first lady myself and 340 million Americans, our hearts are [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=249.82s)]
*  shattered alongside yours and our prayers are with you now. And in the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=254.78s)]
*  days to come, we'll be working very, very diligently in the days to come. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=259.7s)]
*  We're here for you to wipe away the tears and to offer you our devotion, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=263.7s)]
*  our love and our support is great support. In moments like this, the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=268.26s)]
*  differences between Americans fade to nothing compared to the bonds of [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=273.82s)]
*  affection and loyalty that unite us all, both as Americans and even as nations. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=278.02s)]
*  We are one family and today we are all heartbroken. We're all searching for [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=283.9s)]
*  answers. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=289.53999999999996s)]
*  Let's get right to CBS News congressional correspondent Caitlin [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=291.4s)]
*  Huey Burns. She's at Reagan National Airport. Caitlin, thank you for being [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=293.82s)]
*  with us. I want to get to what he said in that press conference in just a [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=297.85999999999996s)]
*  moment. But first, can you talk a little bit about what's happening there at the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=300.78s)]
*  airport? We know it just reopened to the public. Walk us through what you're [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=304.54s)]
*  seeing there on the ground. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=307.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's great to be with you. This airport just reopened to the public. You [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=311.5s)]
*  can see people wheeling their suitcases behind me and heading off to their [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=315.42s)]
*  flights. This is significant because this airport shut down soon after that [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=320.46000000000004s)]
*  crash just before nine p.m. Last night, we arrived here at two in the morning [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=326.42s)]
*  to a completely empty shut down airport except for the families of those [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=332.46000000000004s)]
*  who they lost in the crash the night before they gathered in an American [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=340.26s)]
*  Airlines lounge inside this airport to meet with officials and be together. We [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=346.98s)]
*  encountered one woman around three a.m. Who arrived here at the airport looking [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=354.24s)]
*  for any news about her friend who she found out was on that flight. So very [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=359.74s)]
*  somber morning here and into these early hours. And that's when we found [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=366.42s)]
*  out to that official said that there were no survivors here. But everything [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=371.62s)]
*  has moved on at least technically here at this airport. I talked to one [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=376.14000000000004s)]
*  gentleman who was confident about boarding his flight. He was actually [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=380.90000000000003s)]
*  Wichita originally. He was heading to the area as well today, not concerned [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=385.62s)]
*  about safety. And that has been the line coming from officials as well that [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=392.02s)]
*  this shouldn't have happened, but that consumers flyers Americans around the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=396.78s)]
*  country should still be confident that the planes they're boarding are safe. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=402.97999999999996s)]
*  And Caitlin, as we mentioned, this is now turned into a recovery mission. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=409.94s)]
*  They don't anticipate finding any survivors. What more can you tell us [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=413.54s)]
*  about the next steps, though, in the investigation into why this happened? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=417.58s)]
*  Yeah, well, this investigation now moves into the purview of the NTSB. Um, and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=423.1s)]
*  we don't know yet how long that investigation will take. Yesterday [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=428.26s)]
*  after this crash just before nine p.m. Good 300 first responders at the scene. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=433.06s)]
*  When I was here in the wee hours of the morning, you could see all of the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=440.98s)]
*  bright lights from those first responders vehicles. Um, then several [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=444.70000000000005s)]
*  hours later, fewer and fewer of them. We know that the commercial aircraft [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=449.34000000000003s)]
*  that American Airlines plane when it hit the water, it broke into three pieces. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=455.24s)]
*  And so that is part of the investigation as well. Divers have [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=461.34000000000003s)]
*  been there. The recovery effort is well underway here and has been on. They're [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=466.86s)]
*  waiting to see official counts of what they have. Um, uh, so far. But as we [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=472.82s)]
*  mentioned, officials say there were no survivors here. Lots and lots of [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=480.74s)]
*  questions remain about how this could have happened. Officials note that the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=485.62s)]
*  pattern of this commercial aircraft and the idea that there was a military [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=491.06s)]
*  aircraft is completely normal. That happens all the time. So what was the [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=496.5s)]
*  miscommunication perhaps or what went wrong? No one has at least the public [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=502.34s)]
*  answers to that yet. Yeah, it was interesting because Caitlin in the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=507.5s)]
*  press conference that President Trump just gave, he suggested that the blame [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=510.65999999999997s)]
*  of all this should be placed on the helicopter pilots and he also cited D. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=515.02s)]
*  I policies. Is there evidently evidence that we that you know of or that [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=519.48s)]
*  officials know of that points to that being the reason for this crash? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=524.34s)]
*  Well, that was the first time we had heard it. And actually when he was asked [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=529.98s)]
*  in a follow up, what is the evidence? Do you have any evidence that D. I policies [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=533.4200000000001s)]
*  are to blame? The president said he didn't know, but he thinks it could have [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=538.02s)]
*  been now a little bit of context here at least to explain those comments. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=543.46s)]
*  Remember when the president took office just last week, some of the first [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=549.34s)]
*  executive orders that he signed were to revoke D. I programs at various levels [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=553.74s)]
*  and you heard from other officials at that press conference, his defense [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=559.62s)]
*  secretary, his vice president, his secretary of transportation who just [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=563.54s)]
*  started this job yesterday after being sworn in all echoed that sentiment as [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=570.0600000000001s)]
*  well. So there is no answer to that. And the president himself acknowledged that [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=575.02s)]
*  he does not have evidence for that at this point. I want to go back to the [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=580.42s)]
*  victims who were on board this tragic flight. Caitlin, we understand an ice [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=584.82s)]
*  skating club from boston lost several members of their team in this [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=589.02s)]
*  collision. What more do we know about that? And you also mentioned that [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=593.32s)]
*  there's some russian nationals that were on this flight. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=596.76s)]
*  Yeah, also part of that U. S skating federation. This was a group that had [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=601.32s)]
*  been competing in Wichita and had been making their way back here to [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=609.0s)]
*  Washington. We're still waiting, of course, for official names. But we do [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=614.96s)]
*  know from U. S ice skating that they did have team members on that flight. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=620.2s)]
*  Unfortunately, there is a lot left to be known about who else was on that [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=626.12s)]
*  flight. You heard from lawmakers here in Virginia, where this airport [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=632.1600000000001s)]
*  actually is just at the border of D. C. Um, you know, some members from this [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=636.56s)]
*  area and across the country. So as we're waiting to hear more about the [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=642.16s)]
*  victims here, we know that their families were notified last night, many [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=646.76s)]
*  of them here at this airport also looking for answers. Of course, that is [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=652.06s)]
*  all at the heart of this. Those lost souls in this horrific collision. That [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=656.0799999999999s)]
*  is really a tragedy here in Washington. Oh, my goodness. Absolutely, Caitlin. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=662.8399999999999s)]
*  And we also heard from passengers in Washington where that were at the [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=667.24s)]
*  airport at the time of the crash. They witnessed it. We want to play some of [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=670.92s)]
*  that sound for you and then talk on the other side. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=675.4799999999999s)]
*  I'm sure they're going through just horror. I can't imagine how terrible [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=678.3399999999999s)]
*  that is. The chances of playing crash are so rare that you hear about these [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=682.56s)]
*  things a lot these days and where in the olden days you didn't hear about [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=688.12s)]
*  the stuff because news didn't travel so fast. So, uh, you know, you gotta gotta [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=691.32s)]
*  think that our chances are pretty good getting on a plane this morning. We were [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=695.5200000000001s)]
*  in the middle of the air while the pilot said that there is a tragic [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=698.74s)]
*  incident happened in the D. C. Airport. They could not land. We were scared. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=704.88s)]
*  We were shocked. We are all kids and everybody's like, you know, what happened, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=709.4000000000001s)]
*  what happened in our prayers and thoughts are with the families and [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=714.32s)]
*  everybody who's involved in the incident. You can only imagine the shock [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=717.56s)]
*  and sadness and disbelief that those people who are watching this unfold [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=722.02s)]
*  right in front of their eyes. We understand passengers now face a number [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=726.0799999999999s)]
*  of delays and cancellation. So how is this accident and investigation [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=729.6s)]
*  impacting air travel across the country right now? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=734.0s)]
*  Well, it's a good question. And this particular airport was adamant about [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=739.16s)]
*  reopening and continuing those flights and that partly, you know, sent the [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=743.44s)]
*  message to Americans that it is still safe to fly. And we heard that from [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=747.76s)]
*  officials as well. But I can tell you specifically about this airport. This [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=752.08s)]
*  is a highly trafficked airport. This is also a very frequent stop for [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=755.84s)]
*  lawmakers in Washington coming from here back to their home districts and [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=761.04s)]
*  back to their states. Typically on a Thursday here, you see lots of [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=765.12s)]
*  lawmakers trying to catch last minute flight back to their home states and [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=768.7s)]
*  districts. And so this is a highly trafficked airport, but it is also [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=773.2s)]
*  very small compared to this city. And what we've heard from lawmakers for a [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=778.0400000000001s)]
*  while now is concern about congestion here. Too many flights taking off and [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=784.5600000000001s)]
*  too many flights coming in. That is a concern that predated this this awful [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=789.76s)]
*  tragedy. But this has been on the top of some lawmakers minds as they've [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=796.58s)]
*  been conducting oversight of the FAA. And that's another important thing to [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=801.54s)]
*  note here is that Trump did announce made some news just now saying that he [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=806.52s)]
*  has appointed an acting director, an acting administrator of the FAA. That's [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=810.72s)]
*  significant because that position has been vacant for several weeks as the [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=815.8s)]
*  previous administrator resigned before this administration took office. This is [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=819.74s)]
*  not a political position. Really, it is a five year term, and that's meant to [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=824.84s)]
*  extend beyond a president's term so as not to be political. Um, and so having [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=829.68s)]
*  that position now is significant given that it is vacant. But there are going [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=834.56s)]
*  to be so many questions from lawmakers on Capitol Hill, especially with how [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=839.5999999999999s)]
*  well acquainted they are with this airport and again wanting to get that [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=843.76s)]
*  message to americans across the country about safety when it comes to the air. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=846.88s)]
*  Caitlin, he reburns from Reagan National Airport. Caitlin, thank you so [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=852.28s)]
*  much for that report. Meanwhile, let's listen to more of what the president had [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=855.64s)]
*  to say about this crash from the White House briefing room earlier this morning. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=859.84s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=863.56s)]
*  We do not know what led to this crash, but we have some very strong opinions [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=865.36s)]
*  and ideas, and I think we'll probably state those opinions now. My changed [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=870.76s)]
*  the Obama standards from very mediocre at best to extraordinary. You remember [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=875.76s)]
*  that only the highest aptitude have to be the highest intellect and psychologically [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=881.74s)]
*  superior people were allowed to qualify for air traffic controllers. That was [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=890.3000000000001s)]
*  not so prior to getting there. When I arrived in 2016, I made that change [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=896.6600000000001s)]
*  very early on because I always felt this was a job that and other jobs too. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=903.22s)]
*  But this was a job that had to be superior intelligence. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=907.46s)]
*  Now, the president also said that he believes D E I policies played a role [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=912.34s)]
*  in this. Take a listen to that. I signed something last week that was an [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=916.38s)]
*  executive order, very powerful on restoring the highest standards of air [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=922.5400000000001s)]
*  traffic controllers and others, by the way, then my administration will set [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=925.7s)]
*  the highest possible bar for aviation safety. We have to have our smartest [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=931.22s)]
*  people. It doesn't matter what they look like, how they speak, who they are. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=935.1400000000001s)]
*  Matters intellect talent. The word talent have to be talented, naturally [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=940.22s)]
*  talented geniuses. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=945.5400000000001s)]
*  You can't have regular people doing that job. They won't be able to do it, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=948.4200000000001s)]
*  but will restore faith in American air travel. I'll have more to say about [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=952.72s)]
*  that. I do want to point out that various articles that appeared prior to [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=956.94s)]
*  my entering office and here's one. The F A A s diversity push includes focus [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=963.38s)]
*  on hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=970.1s)]
*  Uh, that is amazing. And then it says F A A. All right, let's bring in C B s [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=976.7s)]
*  News senior White House and political correspondent at O'Keefe. And thank you [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=982.34s)]
*  for being with us. Has there been any reaction yet to the president's [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=985.82s)]
*  comments during this press press conference about D E I policies playing [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=989.66s)]
*  a role in this? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=993.98s)]
*  Well, Elizabeth, it wrapped up at the top of the hour, so it's hard to know. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=995.86s)]
*  But what he's in what he's doing there in essence, and he said he was gonna do [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=999.34s)]
*  this was he's he's jumping to conclusions before an investigation is [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1003.14s)]
*  even underway. And he said, I'm going to do that because he didn't essentially [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1007.02s)]
*  want to have to wait several years until the investigation is over. And [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1010.94s)]
*  what he's doing is essentially drawing attention to a series of steps he's [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1013.86s)]
*  taken since he became president about nine days ago that are designed to end [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1018.8199999999999s)]
*  curtail, stop funding all sorts of programs in the realm of diversity, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1023.78s)]
*  equity inclusion that he says have permeated the federal government [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1028.06s)]
*  needlessly over the last several years and taken the eye of those agencies [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1032.26s)]
*  and departments off of their primary mission, which in the case of the F A A [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1036.46s)]
*  is safety, which in the case of all the others is up for debate. He would not [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1040.02s)]
*  say he was asked and also kind of avoided questions about whether he was [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1044.3s)]
*  seeing something specific in who was involved in this, either in the air [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1048.58s)]
*  traffic control tower or aboard either of the aircraft that would suggest that [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1052.8999999999999s)]
*  somebody in this was hired under one of those programs or is a minority or [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1057.1s)]
*  something else. But that appeared to be what he was inferring and then began to [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1063.9399999999998s)]
*  back off of it throughout the news conference, suggesting instead that, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1067.54s)]
*  look, mistakes were made. We'll have an investigation. We should put out a few [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1071.06s)]
*  things. He said there will be a systematic investigation involving the [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1074.3799999999999s)]
*  FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board, which we're expecting to hold its [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1078.6599999999999s)]
*  first news briefing in about 90 minutes or so and the Defense Department and [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1082.62s)]
*  then proceeded to sort of engage in what has been a years, if not decades long [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1087.4599999999998s)]
*  debate across parties and presidencies about whether the nation skies are safe [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1093.22s)]
*  enough and whether those that ensure that they are have the manpower and [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1098.6599999999999s)]
*  equipment needed to avoid situations like this one. We've heard, of course, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1102.74s)]
*  for the last several years, Elizabeth, about close calls on runways from coast [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1107.06s)]
*  to coast and the concern that air traffic controllers are distracted or [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1110.78s)]
*  not getting enough time off in between shifts to avoid this kind of mistake and [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1115.46s)]
*  to ensure that pilot training, both civilian and military, is proper so that [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1120.06s)]
*  this kind of thing is avoided. What he didn't talk about, but the Defense [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1124.34s)]
*  Secretary did, is the idea that perhaps there are, not the idea, the reality is [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1128.74s)]
*  that there are multiple military operations that go on over the skies of [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1133.82s)]
*  Washington at the same time that commercial aircraft is coming and going [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1138.58s)]
*  from Reagan National Airport. If you live here in Washington, it is not uncommon [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1142.86s)]
*  on weekends and late at night, once the sun goes down, to hear low-flying [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1147.22s)]
*  helicopters over your neighborhoods and often people think, well what happened? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1151.74s)]
*  Are they looking for someone? You look up and you realize, oh it's another Coast [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1155.46s)]
*  Guard helicopter or it's a military helicopter and they're doing those low [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1158.1s)]
*  altitude training missions that they do because they like to use the Potomac [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1161.8999999999999s)]
*  River, which cuts between Virginia and DC, and kind of come up the banks of that [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1165.8999999999999s)]

*  into suburban Maryland, circle around and then head back down the river at low [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1174.6999999999998s)]
*  altitude while planes are landing and coming and going from from from DCA. So [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1178.6999999999998s)]
*  that's part of what may have gone on here. In fact, this morning the [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1183.5s)]
*  president's nominee for secretary of the army conceded to senators during a [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1186.98s)]

*  holding military exercises at that low altitude over the skies of Washington if [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1193.02s)]
*  it interferes with civilian commercial aircraft coming and going from that [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1198.26s)]
*  large airport. And what Caitlin was saying, it is a small place, it is popular [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1202.1s)]
*  with a lot of people who want to be able to get in and out of Washington easily, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1206.34s)]
*  but you've also got multiple military bases, the Coast Guard, the local and [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1208.82s)]
*  state police running those low altitude operations and that may have been [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1212.94s)]
*  part of the problem here. Whether Dei had anything to do with it is absolutely [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1217.02s)]
*  unclear at this point, but the president went there and suggested that the moves [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1220.9s)]
*  he's been making in recent days, controversial disruptive as he promised [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1225.02s)]
*  may be helping solve this mistake that was was so tragic and deadly over the [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1229.9s)]
*  skies of Washington last night. Yeah, it's important important to keep [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1235.8600000000001s)]
*  repeating that that we still don't know exactly what led up to this mistake. The [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1239.54s)]
*  investigation is ongoing. I want to talk though about the victims. We [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1243.3799999999999s)]
*  understand that there excuse me that there were some Russian nationals on [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1247.74s)]
*  that flight. Can you go over what the president said and how he plans to [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1251.26s)]
*  handle the victims families in this? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1254.58s)]
*  He can. He confirmed that Russian nationals were on the flight. We had [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1258.1399999999999s)]
*  heard from an ice skating association and the U. S. Figure skating [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1261.76s)]
*  association that in fact a number of passengers aboard the plane were coming [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1265.98s)]
*  from Wichita from training sessions that were held with younger skaters in [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1270.82s)]
*  the days after a figure skating championship that was held there over [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1275.86s)]
*  last weekend. He said that the U. S. Government has been in touch with the [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1279.46s)]
*  Russian government about getting the Russian nationals back to Russia. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1283.54s)]
*  Should they? Should that be their ultimate resting place? And he also [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1286.34s)]
*  confirmed that there were nationals from other countries, but he wouldn't say [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1290.4199999999998s)]
*  which ones and that information about that would be coming later. Notably [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1293.1399999999999s)]
*  during the briefing, he was asked, Have you talked to President Putin about [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1296.26s)]
*  this? And he very sort of brushed it aside and said quickly, No, I hadn't [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1300.62s)]
*  talked to him. Not about that. So what's unclear is whether in fact there's [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1304.58s)]
*  been a conversation at all since he became president between Trump and [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1308.6599999999999s)]
*  Putin, or if he's referring to something that's not yet been confirmed that may [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1312.6599999999999s)]
*  have happened during the transition, where the two of them may have spoken. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1316.3s)]
*  This has been one of the more intriguing aspects of his new presidency. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1320.06s)]
*  Is to what extent is he in touch with the Russian leader? He may have just [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1323.02s)]
*  inadvertently told us there that there has been a conversation that had not [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1326.3799999999999s)]
*  been officially read out. So as often happens when he speaks, he's [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1329.62s)]
*  established a series of new questions that we're gonna have to answer and [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1334.9399999999998s)]
*  introduced a concept that was not necessarily on the minds of those [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1338.82s)]
*  monitoring the aftermath of this by suggesting that personnel policy across [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1341.8999999999999s)]
*  the federal government may have been to blame. Elizabeth. All right. CBS News [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1346.8999999999999s)]
*  senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe. Ed, thank you [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1350.62s)]
*  so much for being with us. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-nhu9ojLU&t=1353.3s)]
