# China tariffs set to take effect in March
**CBS News:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00)
*  Artificial intelligence giant NVIDIA released its first financial result of the year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=0.0s)]
*  The numbers show AI is alive and well despite AI stocks stumbling recently. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=5.36s)]
*  Newcomers in the race like China's DeepSeek left investors feeling a little bit jittery. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=10.76s)]
*  But now we watch to see whether these new numbers will fuel gains. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=15.24s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News MoneyWatch correspondent Kelly O'Grady. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=18.68s)]
*  OK, so Kelly, welcome in friend. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=22.28s)]
*  What's happening with artificial intelligence and what does it mean for our savings? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=23.88s)]
*  So, Reid, when you ask what's happening with artificial intelligence, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=30.76s)]
*  you basically have to ask what's happening with NVIDIA because NVIDIA is essentially [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=34.04s)]
*  synonymous with artificial intelligence. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  And we have seen this because it is the company that builds the building blocks, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=41.2s)]
*  essentially the chips that power all of these companies and their ability to develop artificial intelligence. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=46.8s)]
*  Think of it as what the Intel chips for the Internet surge. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=53.68s)]
*  And so what you have seen in the stock market over the past couple of years, really, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  is that AI, the hype around artificial intelligence, has really buoyed and fueled the growth [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=62.04s)]
*  and the record highs that you've seen in the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=68.47999999999999s)]
*  And NVIDIA accounts for over 20 percent of the returns that the S&P 500 saw last year alone. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=72.47999999999999s)]
*  And that's really important when it comes to your savings and your 401K, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=81.08s)]
*  because when NVIDIA does well, that means the larger tech stocks that rely on AI to fuel their further growth, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=84.64s)]
*  like Apple and Alphabet and some of the others, when those do well, the S&P 500 does well. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  And when the S&P 500 does well, your 401K does well, because oftentimes your money is invested in a fund that tracks that index. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=98.11999999999999s)]
*  So that's kind of how it all comes together. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  But I'll note NVIDIA, even though it had great earnings yesterday, it's down. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=109.8s)]
*  It's down over three percent right now. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=113.88000000000001s)]
*  And that's because there are some things that are in the market that could potentially hurt NVIDIA. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  We're looking at potential more tariffs on China. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=120.88000000000001s)]
*  And so when you look at your 401K, maybe you see it go down a little bit today. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  All right. So transitioning from that, I think you really key us up to something important, those tariffs on China. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=128.88s)]
*  Those will take effect in a matter of days. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  And, you know, let's look at the social media post. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=138.0s)]
*  To that note, President Donald Trump said in part the proposed tariffs scheduled to go into effect on March 4th will indeed go into effect. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=140.12s)]
*  He says China will be charged an additional 10 percent tariff on that date. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=147.96s)]
*  So that's next week. But I always think about the people down on the ground, the consumer. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=152.44s)]
*  How long will it take for those of us down on the ground to really feel the weight of those tariffs? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=156.8s)]
*  OK, so a 20 percent tariff on China. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=163.36s)]
*  We already have had a 10 percent tariff and you likely haven't actually seen the impacts of that 10 percent tariff over the past couple of weeks. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=166.28s)]
*  And that's because it really depends on the industry, the product that you're buying, whether you see that immediately or on average over the next six to nine months. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=174.8s)]
*  That's normally if we just are talking at the very, very, you know, highest levels, the average across industries. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=185.16000000000003s)]
*  But it really depends on how much supply there is. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=191.88s)]
*  So if you're looking at a new car, for example, and maybe that's going to come from Canada or Mexico, we just talked about those tariffs that may go into effect next Tuesday. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  And if you're getting a new car and it's coming from Canada and it hasn't crossed the border yet, yep, you're going to see the price increase. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=207.04s)]
*  But if you're buying something that maybe there's already supply, there's already something on the lot, you're not going to see that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  So it's really dependent on the supply and the industry of how quickly consumers will see that increase. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=218.24s)]
*  All right. We also understand there's new data on the number of Americans who don't have a job. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=224.36s)]
*  What's the data? OK, so jobless claims came out this morning. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=227.8s)]
*  It's basically the people that are filing for unemployment when they've been laid off and they spiked way more than economists expected. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=233.12s)]
*  It was the highest spike on a weekly basis that we've seen in four months. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=241.8s)]
*  And specifically, when you dig into the data, there was a spike in Washington, D.C. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=245.44s)]
*  Now, that's important. We've seen a lot of layoffs with what's happening with the doge efficiencies. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=250.04s)]
*  And so that's really going to be something to track week over week as we see how more of that plays out. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  But I will note, it's likely not representative of all of it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=261.48s)]
*  In order to be counted in that number, you actually have to be filing for unemployment. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=264.6s)]
*  And that means you have to be actively looking for a job. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=268.72s)]
*  Oftentimes, when people get laid off, they take a break or maybe they even retire. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=271.48s)]
*  But definitely something to watch. All right, Kelly O'Grady. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=274.76s)]
*  So great to talk to you. Thank you so much. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=277.88s)]
*  One day to Friday, we will see how we close out stocks coming up tomorrow. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=279.96s)]
*  Nice to talk to you. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoS_4q6LK00&t=284.76s)]
