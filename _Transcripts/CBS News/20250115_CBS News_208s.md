# Death toll rises to at least 25 from wildfires as Los Angeles area braces for more high winds
**CBS News:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q)
*  We begin this morning with those still deadly wildfires in Southern California burning now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=0.0s)]
*  for more than a week. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=5.4s)]
*  Officials have confirmed another death with at least 25 people losing their lives. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=7.54s)]
*  And the area is bracing for more powerful Santa Ana winds today. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Yesterday, lighter than expected winds allowed firefighters to hold the line against those [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=15.8s)]
*  two largest fires, the Palisades and the Eaton fires we've discussed so much. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=20.84s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Charlie DeMar continues to report from Altadena, California. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=26.279999999999998s)]
*  Charlie, the winds appear to have cooperated Tuesday. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=30.72s)]
*  How is that helping efforts today? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=34.48s)]
*  Hey, all. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=36.48s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  That was some relief for the firefighters here, but they are still on standby. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  There are some 15,000 firefighters stationed throughout Los Angeles. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=42.739999999999995s)]
*  And those two largest fires, the Palisades fire and the Eaton fire, which affected Altadena [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=48.28s)]
*  where we are, they are still burning the Eaton fire, just about 33 percent contained at this point. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=53.24s)]
*  And here in Altadena, we have seen search and rescue crews conducting the grim task of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  searching the some 7000 buildings and homes that were destroyed by the fire. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=65.48s)]
*  And that's really one of the reasons why residents have not been allowed back in yet, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=70.92s)]
*  because, of course, to allow search and rescue crews to do their job. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=75.36s)]
*  And there's also power lines that are still down. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  We know that they had to institute a curfew because of so much looting that was taking place. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=82.72s)]
*  And now we understand nearly 50 arrests have been made since last week linked to the fires. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=88.92s)]
*  What more can you tell us about that? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=94.72s)]
*  That curfew has been in place. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=98.16s)]
*  Police making it very clear that if you aren't a contractor, if you have no business being in one [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=100.0s)]
*  of these decimated areas, simply stay out. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=105.16s)]
*  Yes, there have been a number of arrests. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=108.48s)]
*  Most of the arrests have actually come from the Altadena area, but the LAPD releasing some video, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=110.12s)]
*  some ring camera video from inside one of the homes. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=115.48s)]
*  Police say that those were looters going through a home there. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  And that is what police are warning about people who are tragically taking advantage of just this awful [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=122.92s)]
*  situation, people who are in a terrible situation. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=128.56s)]
*  And police also releasing new information about an arson suspect who was arrested. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=131.56s)]
*  They're also making it clear, though, that this arson suspect, the arrest, the charges that he faces [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=137.04s)]
*  are not responsible for the fires that we have seen widespread here in the L.A. area. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=142.67999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, shocking to see that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=148.64s)]
*  And finally, Charlie, I saw some areas, areals of Altadena. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=150.0s)]
*  I'm still stunned at how block by block it seems completely flattened. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=153.68s)]
*  Are there plans to repopulate eventually or is it almost too early for people to even think in those terms yet? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, Errol, this is what people are coming home to. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=165.36s)]
*  It really is hard to make out. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=168.96s)]
*  I mean, after covering other disasters, hurricanes, tornadoes, you can usually see some resemblance of a home. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=171.0s)]
*  You can see furniture. You can see household items with this. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=177.4s)]
*  There's just nothing here. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=181.68s)]
*  And just imagine it block by block by block, really an entire community, neighborhoods eliminated in a matter of hours. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  So I think the rebuild process a little too early right now to be talking about that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=191.23999999999998s)]
*  But FEMA is on the ground here offering some assistance. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=195.72s)]
*  But to that point, FEMA is also warning about possible scams here, Errol. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=199.88s)]
*  All right. So much to keep an eye on, Charlie. Thanks so much. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY2EFEAPh3Q&t=205.32s)]
