# What still needs to happen before Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal is implemented
**CBS News:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o)
*  All right, so move now to the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=0.0s)]
*  A ceasefire and hostage deal [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=2.96s)]
*  hostage deal between Israel and Hamas [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=4.96s)]
*  appears to be back on track today. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=7.32s)]
*  After hitting a last minute snag yesterday, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=9.9s)]
*  Israel Security Cabinet voted to approve the deal. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=12.48s)]
*  Now the deal goes to the full cabinet [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=15.36s)]
*  for a second and final vote. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=18.2s)]
*  If it passes the ceasefire and release [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=20.52s)]
*  of the first group of hostages could [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=23.0s)]
*  begin as soon as Sunday, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=25.6s)]
*  but even with the ceasefire deal looming, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=27.32s)]
*  the ISIS Hamas run health ministry says [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=29.92s)]
*  deadly Israeli airstrikes continued overnight. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=32.56s)]
*  So let's go now to CBS News. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=34.64s)]
*  Foreign correspondent Ramiy [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=37.04s)]
*  Innocencio who is live for us in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=38.64s)]
*  Rami, thank you for being with us. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=41.68s)]
*  That second cabinet meeting [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=43.96s)]
*  and vote will happen soon. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=45.2s)]
*  What's the very latest from your end? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=46.72s)]
*  Aliz, yes, good to see you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=51.96s)]
*  In fact, that second cabinet [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=53.92s)]
*  meeting is happening as we speak. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=55.56s)]
*  The full cabinet is made up of 10 ministers [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=58.24s)]
*  and it is expected to pass. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=61.64s)]
*  This is the expectation going into it [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=64.8s)]
*  over the past couple hours. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=66.6s)]
*  And I say that because it was already passed [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=68.0s)]
*  through the earlier security cabinet [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=70.8s)]
*  made up of five ministers. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=73.12s)]
*  And that is despite two of those five ministers [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=74.48s)]
*  voting against this ceasefire and hostage deal. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=78.28s)]
*  Those two ministers we knew had been causing [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  political infighting in Prime Minister [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=85.16000000000001s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right coalition, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=87.92s)]
*  the National Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrek. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=90.68s)]
*  Bezalel Smotrek is the finance minister [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=95.68s)]
*  as well as National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gavir. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=97.36s)]
*  Itamar Ben-Gavir himself has said that he would resign [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  if the ceasefire and hostage deal went ahead. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=103.56s)]
*  We're still waiting for that to happen. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=106.0s)]
*  But let's say that they come out of this second meeting, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=107.48s)]
*  this cabinet meeting with an approval. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=111.72s)]
*  There still is another hurdle to get through. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=114.24s)]
*  This is in regards to lawsuits. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=117.16s)]
*  Then over the next 24 hours after approval, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=120.32s)]
*  potentially, potentially the families of Israeli hostages [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=123.72s)]
*  or people who have loved ones who have been killed by Hamas [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=128.44s)]
*  can then file lawsuits against the government [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=131.88s)]
*  to try to stop this deal from going forward. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=134.32s)]
*  With that said, it is still expected [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=137.92s)]
*  that this will carry on. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=141.04s)]
*  And if it does, the prime minister's office [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=141.96s)]
*  still does expect that the first hostages [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=144.56s)]
*  will come out of Gaza this Sunday. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=146.52s)]
*  I can't imagine what the families of these hostages [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=148.52s)]
*  have been going through the past few days. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  First, you get the word that there could be [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=153.44s)]
*  a potential ceasefire agreement. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  Then you hear about a snag, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  and now it looks like it's happening. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  But they're not quite sure when they could potentially [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=159.16s)]
*  see their loved ones. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=161.12s)]
*  You've been speaking with some of the family members [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=162.32s)]
*  of these hostages. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  What do they tell you? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=165.32s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=167.16s)]
*  In speaking with these hostage families, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=168.0s)]
*  it depends on who you talk to in terms of timeline, right? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=171.48000000000002s)]
*  So because there is the phase one timeline of six weeks, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  then there's a phase two timeline of another six weeks. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  If you talk to the families in this first phase, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=181.88s)]
*  sure, they are hopeful when they haven't been [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  hopeful before, perhaps. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  But that is just this first group. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  For example, in the second group, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=195.72s)]
*  which is made up of men and male soldiers, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  we spoke with one brother of a hostage family, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  and his name is Eli David. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=205.84s)]
*  He was saying that it's a complicated feeling [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=208.92s)]
*  where he's happy for the first phase of hostages coming out. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=212.28s)]
*  He says that they feel like his relatives, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  that they've all become this kind of family. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=218.32s)]
*  He says that they feel like his relatives, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=220.2s)]
*  that they've all become this kind of community. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=221.68s)]
*  But at the same time, he's still very fearful [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=223.48s)]
*  that his brother still has to wait, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=226.04s)]
*  he said underground for another six weeks [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=228.04s)]
*  before potentially he could come out. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=230.64s)]
*  So there's this timeline of anticipation, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=232.56s)]
*  of agony that will continue. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=235.88s)]
*  And of course, we don't know how far it will continue [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=238.92s)]
*  because there are so many different moving parts [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=241.48s)]
*  that have to be fulfilled pretty much every week. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=245.72s)]
*  The first group of hostages coming out on Sunday, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=248.72s)]
*  if they do come out, said to be three. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=251.88s)]
*  Then seven days later, it should be three or four. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=254.16s)]
*  Then seven days after that, another three or four. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=256.8s)]
*  How can we make that step-by-step movement to the next [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=259.04s)]
*  while making sure it doesn't collapse? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=262.76s)]
*  And, Rami, some fear that this deal [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=265.72s)]
*  could still fall through, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=267.64s)]
*  saying they'll believe it when they see it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=269.32s)]
*  So what will it take to keep this deal [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=271.44s)]
*  from collapsing again? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=273.76s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=279.0s)]
*  You know, I think we have to look through this [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  through the political lens. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=281.76000000000005s)]
*  Because first off, we know that the president [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=284.20000000000005s)]
*  like Donald Trump, of course, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=288.6s)]
*  is going to be president on Monday. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=289.76000000000005s)]
*  And it will be up to him, along with Israel and Hamas [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=291.68s)]
*  and other negotiating partners, including Egypt and Qatar, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=295.32000000000005s)]
*  to try to continue to guide this deal through phase one, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=300.44000000000005s)]
*  through phase two, through phase three, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=305.0s)]
*  to make sure it doesn't collapse. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=306.6s)]
*  I think, I believe that it will require good faith and trust. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=308.72s)]
*  With that said, even saying that, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=313.32000000000005s)]
*  looking back over the past 468 days [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=315.24s)]
*  since October 7th, 2023, has there been good faith? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=317.92s)]
*  Has there been trust? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=321.56s)]
*  Of course, we know the answer is no. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  It's almost as if you try to look into a fog [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=324.8s)]
*  as you're driving down a road. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=328.0s)]
*  You can only see so far ahead of you. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=329.68s)]
*  The further you try to look ahead, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=332.32000000000005s)]
*  it just becomes murkier and murkier. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=334.20000000000005s)]
*  I believe that is where we are right now. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=336.08000000000004s)]
*  I believe that we're going to have to take this day by day, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=338.16s)]
*  week by week, to try to continue to corral all of the partners [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=342.24s)]
*  to carry on through to the next phase. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3T6IvJyT0o&t=346.36s)]
