# What to know about Trump's ultimatum for Hamas about hostages
**CBS News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI)
*  Let's start out with the war in the Middle East this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=0.0s)]
*  Hamas is shrugging off the president's demand that the group release all of its remaining [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=2.4s)]
*  hostages by this weekend, or, quote, all hell will break out. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=6.0200000000000005s)]
*  That is a quote from the president of the United States. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=11.08s)]
*  It comes as the king of Jordan will be at the White House today, a nation that could [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=13.24s)]
*  be critical to President Trump's larger plans for the region. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=16.18s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes to break this all [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  down. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=24.8s)]
*  We had a report this morning on CBS Mornings where it took a lot of people by surprise [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=25.8s)]
*  what the president said about Hamas and this ultimatum that he delivered. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  Does anybody understand or know what he's signaling by saying that all hell will break [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=36.24s)]
*  out? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=40.66s)]
*  I don't think they do, Vlad, partly because this was an off-the-cuff remark that was made [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=41.660000000000004s)]
*  in response to a reporter's question in the Oval Office. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=47.92s)]
*  It didn't appear to be something that he had planned to say. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=51.84s)]
*  And so how serious is he? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=54.64s)]
*  No one really knows, and that's part of the strategy with this Trump administration, is [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=56.76s)]
*  to leave adversaries guessing about whether he really means it or not. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=60.76s)]
*  And so now we've got four days to find out because this deadline that he set is for Hamas [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=65.64s)]
*  to release the hostages by noon on Saturday. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=71.44s)]
*  He says if they don't do it, all hell is going to break out. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=75.02s)]
*  We don't know exactly what that means. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=78.74000000000001s)]
*  He added that he believes that most of the remaining hostages are dead, which would ostensibly [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=80.48s)]
*  make it harder to release them. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=87.72s)]
*  But nevertheless, this is what the president has said. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=89.88000000000001s)]
*  And it's another thing that he said, Vlad, that is probably going to create some tension [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=93.42s)]
*  in his meeting here at the White House with the king of Jordan in just about an hour and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=97.82000000000001s)]
*  a half, because in an interview with Fox News when he was asked whether Palestinians [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=104.68s)]
*  would have a right to return to Gaza under his vision of taking ownership of the territory [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=111.12s)]
*  and causing all of the Palestinians to leave while he rebuilt it into a beautiful set of [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=119.0s)]
*  resorts on the Mediterranean, he said, no, they wouldn't have the right to come back. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=124.68s)]
*  They'd be very happy living somewhere else. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=129.60000000000002s)]
*  That is not the way that the king of Jordan and leader of Egypt and other Middle Eastern [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=132.72s)]
*  leaders see things going. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=138.84s)]
*  Some of them have described that proposal as ethnic cleansing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  So we'll see whether these two men get into it today, especially with foreign aid for [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=145.28s)]
*  Jordan apparently on the line. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=150.56s)]
*  Yeah, it will be very interesting to see, Nancy, when this weekend comes, if Hamas follows [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=152.6s)]
*  through with the president's ultimatum or if they don't. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=158.4s)]
*  And then it's sort of the ball is in the president's court. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=161.58s)]
*  If he doesn't do whatever it is that he's signaling that he'll do, he'll seem weak. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=164.22s)]
*  And yet it doesn't appear that there's a strategy to do anything if Hamas doesn't meet that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=168.94000000000003s)]
*  deadline. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=172.62s)]
*  So we'll, of course, be watching. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=173.62s)]
*  The other thing that I thought was interesting, Nancy, was the president was asked who his [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=174.62s)]
*  successor was. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=179.26000000000002s)]
*  And you would think that it would be the vice president of the United States. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=180.86s)]
*  Instead, the president said something very interesting and very different. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=184.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=188.14000000000001s)]
*  He said, no, I don't necessarily see JD Vance as my successor. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=189.14s)]
*  I do not see him as my successor. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=194.14s)]
*  Basically, he said the vice president's only been on the job for a few weeks, so let's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=196.29999999999998s)]
*  see. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=200.94s)]
*  He doesn't want to tip his head now when there are four years to go before the election. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=201.94s)]
*  It's a fairly unorthodox response from a president of the United States. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=209.33999999999997s)]
*  of pay lip service at the very least to the person who they've chosen as their number [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=215.14s)]
*  two. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=220.22s)]
*  He didn't criticize his vice president in any way. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=221.22s)]
*  He just said there's a lot of people who are going to want that job, and he thinks that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=224.26s)]
*  the vice president's doing a good job for right now. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=229.45999999999998s)]
*  But let's see. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=232.22s)]
*  Yeah, it was interesting, Nancy. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=233.22s)]
*  I took a look at some of the headlines of newspapers in France, and they're all sort [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=234.89999999999998s)]
*  of making a point to highlight those comments, given that the vice president was in Paris [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=238.98s)]
*  for that AI conference. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=243.94s)]
*  So while perhaps the rest of the world isn't paying that much attention to it, certainly [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=246.02s)]
*  the country the vice president is visiting, one of our key allies is. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=249.66s)]
*  Nancy Cordes for us at the White House. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=253.57999999999998s)]
*  Nancy, wait real quick, Nancy. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=255.57999999999998s)]
*  Is there going to be a press conference between the president and with the King of Jordan [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=257.3s)]
*  at some point later today? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=261.74s)]
*  There is not a press conference scheduled, and it's eagle-eyed of you to pick up on [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=263.7s)]
*  because there was a press conference when the leader of Japan was here. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=270.14s)]
*  There was a press conference when the leader of Israel was here. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=276.21999999999997s)]
*  No press conference this time, which could be a reflection of the fact that, you know, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=279.98s)]
*  you wouldn't anticipate that the King of Jordan would be able to express support for this [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=285.58s)]
*  Gaza plan that President Trump has laid out. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=291.38s)]
*  So it wouldn't be a great PR move for either one of them. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=294.22s)]
*  The White House hasn't said why they're not doing it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=300.22s)]
*  All we know is we'll get a glimpse of them saying hello, saying goodbye, but no formal [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=303.02000000000004s)]
*  press conference. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=307.62s)]
*  Yeah, it will be interesting, Nancy, given that there isn't a press conference when the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=308.62s)]
*  two are sitting in that room for that photo op. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=312.26000000000005s)]
*  I know you and the rest of the press corps will shout some questions and we'll see if [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=314.1s)]
*  either of those men respond. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=318.06s)]
*  If I know the president, he probably might. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=320.34000000000003s)]
*  So we'll be watching. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=322.6s)]
*  Thank you, Nancy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=323.64000000000004s)]
*  We'll do our best. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=324.64000000000004s)]
*  Thanks, Nance. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=325.64000000000004s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=326.64000000000004s)]
*  Back to that situation in the Middle East. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=327.64000000000004s)]
*  In Israel, there has been mixed reaction to President Trump's warning to Hamas. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=330.12s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=334.56s)]
*  I think the most important thing is to get back our people to Israel and not push it [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=335.56s)]
*  and not threaten the Hamas, because that's not the way. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=343.88s)]
*  To say that we're going to squash you and kill you even more plays into Hamas's hands [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=347.56s)]
*  and plays out of our hands. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=352.2s)]
*  I think this is a pattern that you you make some highly outrageous statement and then [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=353.96s)]
*  and then you back down from it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=361.44s)]
*  You back down from it to something more moderate. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=363.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=367.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, demonstrators have been protesting outside of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=367.8s)]
*  office in Jerusalem this morning. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=371.84s)]
*  They are calling for an end to the war and the release of all the remaining hostages. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=373.28s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Chris Lovesay has more. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=376.96s)]
*  Well, the news of Hamas halting hostage releases is just devastating to both Israelis and Palestinians, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=380.48s)]
*  as it means the ceasefire is once again in jeopardy. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=387.68s)]
*  The Israeli defense minister Israel Katz said he's readying forces in Gaza. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=390.6s)]
*  Families of Israeli hostages blocked traffic in Tel Aviv. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=396.84000000000003s)]
*  They're panicked by Hamas halting more hostage releases like the one last weekend, and they're [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=400.44s)]
*  distraught after seeing the condition they were in. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=405.0s)]
*  They came home with news both welcome and distressing hostage alone. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=408.28s)]
*  Oh, hell is alive, but starving with untreated wounds and bound in chains. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=413.08s)]
*  That's according to his mother, who made an impassioned plea to President Trump to do [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=419.08s)]
*  everything in his power to bring her son home in the past four weeks. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=423.64s)]
*  The now imperiled ceasefire has brought home hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and allowed [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=427.71999999999997s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of Gazans to return to what's left of their homes in the north [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=433.0s)]
*  of the Gaza Strip. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=437.4s)]
*  Those gains are now in jeopardy, with Gazans beginning to stock up on supplies for fear [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=438.76s)]
*  that war will return. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=444.92s)]
*  Here in Tel Aviv, Israelis are just distraught over the 76 hostages still held by Hamas, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=447.0s)]
*  and today the Israeli military announced that the oldest one of them, 86-year-old Shlomo [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=452.92s)]
*  Mansour, was murdered in captivity. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=458.44s)]
*  He was a survivor of the 1941 pogrom in Iraq where hundreds were killed in an anti-Semitic [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=461.64s)]
*  riot. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ontj-CKv_WI&t=468.04s)]
