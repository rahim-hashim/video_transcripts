# Some migrant detainees released as ICE facilities fill up
**CBS News:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY)
*  US Immigration and Customs Enforcement's detention systems are full. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=0.0s)]
*  So much so that the agency is releasing some migrant detainees. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=4.9s)]
*  Internal government statistics obtained by CBS show ICE facilities were at 109 percent [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=9.5s)]
*  capacity this week. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=15.36s)]
*  The agency is housing nearly 42,000 undocumented migrants despite only having about 38,000 [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=16.94s)]
*  beds. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=23.0s)]
*  CBS News has learned roughly 160 migrant detainees were released from ICE custody Monday. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=24.0s)]
*  This comes as the White House confirmed the arrival of the first migrant detainee flight [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=29.86s)]
*  to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=34.1s)]
*  President Trump has proposed holding as many as 30,000 people there. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  CBS News immigration and politics reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez joins us now from our [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=40.7s)]
*  Washington DC bureau. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=45.04s)]
*  So Camilo, good to see you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=46.379999999999995s)]
*  Let's start with the ICE releases in the US. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=48.06s)]
*  Are they still, the migrant detainees still being monitored or are there any proposed [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=50.620000000000005s)]
*  solutions? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=54.739999999999995s)]
*  Some of them are still being tracked by the agency fitting them with ankle monitors to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=56.32s)]
*  track their movements and they are still facing deportation proceedings which is really important [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=60.76s)]
*  to underscore Lindsay because these are folks who are in the country illegally but ICE is [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=65.94s)]
*  deciding to on a case by case basis release them while those proceedings are adjudicated [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=70.78s)]
*  and this is happening mainly for low level offenders or people who lack criminal records, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=77.16s)]
*  are determined Lindsay to pose a threat to public safety such as serious criminals or [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=83.0s)]
*  national security such as suspected terrorists are still being held in ICE custody. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=87.16s)]
*  That is really important to underscore. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=90.84s)]
*  Camilo, this wasn't exactly unforeseeable. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=92.76s)]
*  Journalists had been pressing then Trump campaign officials, campaign officials before he was [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=95.6s)]
*  elected about the logistics of this mass deportation plan including where they would be housed, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=100.28s)]
*  right? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=105.64s)]
*  That is true and the Trump administration is facing the same operational and legal challenges [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=107.02s)]
*  that have really bedeviled Republican and Democratic administrations on this vexing issue [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=112.89999999999999s)]
*  of immigration enforcement and border enforcement. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=118.38s)]
*  We know that of course the Biden administration struggled with an unprecedented influx of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=121.02s)]
*  migrants along the US-Mexico border and to find space to detain and house them and also [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=124.56s)]
*  the resources to deport them to their home countries including nations like Venezuela [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=130.26s)]
*  that to this day are still not allowing deportations from the US though President Trump has announced [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=135.42s)]
*  that the Venezuelan government rather Lindsay is now going to be taking deportation flights [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=142.01999999999998s)]
*  from the US and because of the limited bed capacity now that ICE is facing the agency [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=146.22s)]
*  is trying to enlist the help of other agencies to be able to dramatically expand the tension [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=151.8s)]
*  capacity. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=157.42s)]
*  We are told by US officials that customs and border protection facilities along the US-Mexico [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=158.46s)]
*  border that were designed to detain unaccompanied children and migrant families with minors [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=163.78s)]
*  crossing the US-Mexico border are now being considered to be used to house ICE detainees [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=169.98s)]
*  arrested in the interior of the country and of course ICE is also turning to now the Department [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=175.14s)]
*  of Defense which has granted the agency access to Guantanamo Bay of course but also a military [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=180.01999999999998s)]
*  installation in the Denver area and we are told that more military installation could [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=185.7s)]
*  be used to house immigrant detainees to again try to fulfill what the president has promised [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=191.16000000000003s)]
*  will be the largest deportation operation in American history. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=196.32000000000002s)]
*  The Trump administration has reached a deal with El Salvador to send migrant detainees [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=200.84s)]
*  and imprisoned citizens to a mega prison there so first of all what is the idea of sending [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=204.52s)]
*  imprisoned American citizens there and what are the conditions like in that facility? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=209.4s)]
*  Well I think it's important for us Lindsay to try to distinguish between the different [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  arrangements that are being outlined here by the government in El Salvador and the Trump [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=216.6s)]
*  administration. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=221.16s)]
*  One of them is a so-called safe third country agreement that will allow the US to deport [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=222.4s)]
*  non-Salvadorian migrants who cross into the US illegally to El Salvador with instructions [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=227.16s)]
*  to request asylum there instead of in the US so this could be migrants from other Central [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=232.72s)]
*  American countries but also migrants from Venezuela and other nations that limit or [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=237.84s)]
*  outright reject US deportees. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=243.06s)]
*  One plan involves the US being able to send Venezuelan gang members or at least suspected [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=245.72s)]
*  Venezuelan gang members who are believed to be members of the Tren de Aragua prison gang [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=250.92s)]
*  to El Salvador so that country can detain them in their own prisons. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=255.4s)]
*  The other plan looks to be a law enforcement arrangement not related to immigration necessary [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=260.76s)]
*  Lindsay that would allow El Salvador to house American convicts such as citizens and legal [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=266.96s)]
*  permanent residents who are undergoing their criminal proceedings in the US and to detain [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=273.85999999999996s)]
*  them in El Salvador in their maximum security prisons and El Salvador apparently would get [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=279.9s)]
*  a monetary fee for housing those American criminal detainees but again that would not [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=285.41999999999996s)]
*  be necessarily an immigration arrangement it would be sort of like a extradition treaty [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=290.21999999999997s)]
*  and a law enforcement criminal focus arrangement. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=296.14s)]
*  Camila Montoya Galvez thank you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFz1IPoQbTY&t=300.94s)]
