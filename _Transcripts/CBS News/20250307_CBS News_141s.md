*  They were both. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=12.88s)]

*  He's live in Santa Fe, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  New Mexico with the very latest on this [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  up to date. What do we know so far? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=29.68s)]
*  Well, first of all, we're hoping to get [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=33.56s)]
*  some definitive answers today on cause [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=35.68s)]
*  of death. We know very little so far. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=37.36s)]
*  We know the circumstances that they were [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=39.72s)]
*  founded. We know that Gene Hackman was [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=41.96s)]
*  found in the mud room of his house, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=44.04s)]
*  his cane and sunglasses nearby, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=46.28s)]
*  possibly suggesting some sort of fall. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  His wife Betsy Arkawa founded a bathroom, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=49.72s)]
*  some pills scattered on the counter. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  Now they did talk about the types [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=53.72s)]
*  of pills that they found. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  They said it was a dog. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=57.36s)]
*  They said it was Tylenol, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  thyroid medication, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=60.68s)]
*  blood pressure medication, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=61.4s)]
*  that sort of thing. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=62.28s)]
*  So we know the autopsies have [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=63.48s)]
*  been completed right now. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=65.52s)]
*  They don't show any signs of external trauma, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  so right now they don't appear or foul play. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=69.32s)]
*  Does it appear to be involved? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=72.12s)]
*  But you know the sheriff when they [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  found these bodies said it was suspicious [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=76.28s)]
*  enough to warrant investigation. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=78.8s)]
*  One important piece of evidence that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=80.52s)]
*  they do have and they did have [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=82.52s)]
*  initially was Gene Hackman's pacemaker. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=84.68s)]
*  It stopped when they found the body [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=86.52s)]
*  and stopped working on February 17th. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=88.68s)]
*  Now they were found on the 26th, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=90.76s)]
*  and what that suggests is that he was [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=93.0s)]
*  dead for possibly as many as nine days. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=95.56s)]
*  And Carter, what do we know [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=99.04s)]
*  about Gene Hackman's children? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=100.44000000000001s)]
*  Have they played a role at all [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=101.56s)]
*  in this investigation? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=103.04s)]
*  Well, you know, I'm sure they've [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  been talking with investigators. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=107.48s)]
*  He has a few children and one of them, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=108.48s)]
*  Leslie, put out a statement that [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=111.04s)]
*  she hadn't talked to her daughter. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  She hadn't talked to her father [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=114.56s)]
*  in a couple of months, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=116.08000000000001s)]
*  but that was not uncommon for them. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=117.52s)]
*  That was the kind of relationship they had. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=119.36s)]
*  The couple was kind of reclusive. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=121.44s)]
*  They kept to themselves. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  Hopefully investigators will be able [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=124.24s)]
*  to get some information about what [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  the couple was going through if anything [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  was happening in the family from the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=129.8s)]
*  children and hopefully we'll find [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=131.76s)]
*  out if they did today. Alright, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  we'll look forward to that news conference. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=134.68s)]
*  Carter Evans, thank you so much for that report. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAIv7plIuR4&t=136.64s)]
