# What to know about the wildfires in North and South Carolina
**CBS News:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI)
*  All right, closer to home now, fire crews in North and South Carolina are working to contain the remaining wildfires that are burning across different parts of the states. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=0.0s)]
*  This video shows one of the biggest fires that burned yesterday near the coastal city of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, the South Carolina Forestry Commission. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=7.34s)]
*  There are only three wildfires remaining after 163 incidents were initially reported. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=15.9s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News national correspondent Dave Malkoff, who joins me from Carolina Forest, South Carolina. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=21.96s)]
*  So, Dave, earlier this morning on CBS Mornings, your live shot was completely smoke filled. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=29.44s)]
*  I can still see it smoldering behind you. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=35.12s)]
*  What are you seeing now on the ground and what's to come? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  This is basically the same neighborhood, Vlad. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=42.36s)]
*  You can see how the wind pushes the smoke away, but the smoke is rising here in the woods behind these neighborhoods. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  You may hear the South Carolina Forestry Commission going round and round in a Cessna doing their surveillance of this area, but you may think this is deep in the woods. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=52.800000000000004s)]
*  Let me show you what's actually happening here. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  Look at all these fence lines all the way down here turned into liquid taffy and all just put down on the ground here, Vlad. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  This is Bob Maddox's house. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=75.36s)]
*  And watch if you follow the blackened grass there, you can see exactly how close that got to Bob Maddox's house. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=79.28s)]
*  So many firefighters from all over this region were here all throughout the weekend, putting a stop to these flames right at the very last second. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=89.16s)]
*  So if we think about that there are no lives lost here, there are no structures lost here, that's because of the massive effort of these firefighters. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=101.28s)]
*  Because think of how close it came to losing Bob Maddox's house here. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=110.6s)]
*  Unbelievable. Dave Malkoff reporting for us. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=115.6s)]
*  Dave, thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=118.19999999999999s)]
*  All right. Let's get some weather now. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=120.72s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Andrew Kozak with the first look at the national forecast. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=122.08s)]
*  Hey, Andrew. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=126.84s)]
*  Hey, Vlad. Good morning. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=128.68s)]
*  Yeah, we are going to be watching, of course, that area. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=129.72s)]
*  It's a big concern. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=132.16s)]
*  The fire is still, of course, raging on. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=133.24s)]
*  And what we need is some moisture. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=135.36s)]
*  Now we will have rain coming in our direction. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=136.96s)]
*  That's going to help with those humidity levels. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  We're also going to turn those winds off, but it is still very dry. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=140.44s)]
*  Take a look at the humidity levels in areas like Columbia. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  Seventeen percent humidity, very dry this afternoon. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=145.56s)]
*  Even with some winds gusting between 10 and 15, we could see those fires continue. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=149.24s)]
*  But the good news here is that once we start getting into Tuesday morning, tomorrow and even into your Wednesday, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=153.88s)]
*  we still keep those gusts around, but we start to get that breeze off the Atlantic. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=159.4s)]
*  And that will help to really moisten up things a little bit. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=163.8s)]
*  So it won't be nearly as dry. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=166.44s)]
*  Plus, we're going to be talking about some rain coming in. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=167.88s)]
*  The bad news, though, is that that will come on the heels of the potential severe weather system [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=170.96s)]
*  coming in from Monday into Tuesday in the deep south and then Wednesday for the shore and the coast. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=176.36s)]
*  We'll talk more about that in just a couple of minutes. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  Vlad. All right, Andrew, thank you very much, my friend. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kqqQOyreI&t=182.92000000000002s)]
