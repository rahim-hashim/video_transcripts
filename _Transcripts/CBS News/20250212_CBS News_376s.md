# Senate confirms Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence
**CBS News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc)
*  Right off the top breaking news out of Capitol Hill, the Senate just voted to confirm Tulsi [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=0.0s)]
*  Gabbard as director of national intelligence. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=6.24s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=9.28s)]
*  Looks like we don't have that sound, but we do have CBS News congressional reporter Torian [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=15.32s)]
*  Small who's live on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  We know Gabbard is one of Trump's most embattled cabinet picks. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=21.84s)]
*  So Torian, what does this signal exactly? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=25.28s)]
*  Yeah, it signals that Republicans are in lockstep when it comes to placating President Trump. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=28.48s)]
*  We've seen previously with some of the more controversial picks like Pete Hegseth that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=36.3s)]
*  Republicans were willing to break the party line in order to quote unquote vote with their [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=43.0s)]
*  conscience as many have said before. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=48.72s)]
*  This time around, there's been an intense pressure campaign from those in Trump's orbit [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=51.82s)]
*  to get Republicans in line for the rest of these nominees. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=57.38s)]
*  As we saw here, Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, those are two normally on the fence Republicans [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=62.58s)]
*  who ultimately sided with the party to push Gabbard across the finish line. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=69.62s)]
*  Former Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is the one defector from the party who decided [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=75.86s)]
*  he just couldn't vote for Gabbard this time. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=82.53999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't matter though as she, as you just said, was confirmed and she's on her way to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=84.38s)]
*  the Department of National Intelligence. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=88.82s)]
*  Okay, Torian, we also know that procedural vote to advance RFK's nomination is expected. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=90.78s)]
*  What do we think is going to come out from that? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=97.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny because Republicans are looking to fast track as many nominees and cabinet [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=101.86s)]
*  picks as possible. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=108.06s)]
*  Now we're in the process known as hurry up and wait. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=109.78s)]
*  Republicans have about 30 hours until they could finally vote for RFK Jr. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=114.14s)]
*  That's because Democrats can invoke and utilize to the fullest of the rule a debate procedure [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=118.94s)]
*  that allows them 30 hours. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=125.62s)]
*  I don't know how to do the math, but sometime tomorrow, probably late evening, is when we'll [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=128.78s)]
*  see a vote for RFK. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=133.98s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know how to do math either, Torian, because journalists are just not good [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=135.26s)]
*  at math. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=139.18s)]
*  But we're going to talk about budget right now, which also has something to do with math. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=140.18s)]
*  House leadership just released their budget blueprint while the Senate Budget Committee [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=144.29999999999998s)]
*  is marking up its budget today. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=148.18s)]
*  So how are these plans expected to be different from each other? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=150.14s)]
*  Yeah, significantly different. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=154.34s)]
*  On the Senate side, we know that because they released this last week, their outline or [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=157.06s)]
*  their blueprint includes two bills. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=162.1s)]
*  And notably absent from that is a measure that would tee up increasing the debt ceiling. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=165.1s)]
*  And the House Republicans' version, it's one bill, one big, beautiful bill, as Republicans [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=172.34s)]
*  have said, taking a part of our page out of Donald Trump's book. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=177.57999999999998s)]
*  They want one bill that includes that measure. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=182.18s)]
*  That would be around $4 trillion that they're looking at to increase the debt ceiling. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=184.62s)]
*  That would account for about $4 trillion, around $4.5 trillion to account for an extension [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=189.62s)]
*  of Trump's 2016 tax cuts. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=196.06s)]
*  They're also looking at $1.5 trillion in spending cuts across the board over the next 10 years [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=199.06s)]
*  to offset that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=205.88s)]
*  On the Senate side, though, it's all self-contained. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=207.86s)]
*  So if you're looking at any new spending, would be offset by cuts that Lindsey Graham, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  who is the Senate Budget Committee chair, is authorizing to corresponding committees [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=215.66000000000003s)]
*  in their respective budgets. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=222.74s)]
*  One other thing, though, as it relates to this budget battle, this is all internal among [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=224.82000000000002s)]
*  Republicans. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=229.66000000000003s)]
*  So House Speaker Johnson said that anything that comes out of the Senate will be a non-starter [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=230.94s)]
*  because he can't find consensus among his 218 members to support that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=238.26s)]
*  So he's asking Senate Republicans to follow their lead. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=243.58s)]
*  Senate Republicans, Lindsey Graham, I talked to him today. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=247.98s)]
*  He said while he respects Johnson, he respectfully also disagrees. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=251.42000000000002s)]
*  And he's asking him to listen to Tom Homan. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=255.58s)]
*  The borders are, who's asking for immediate funding, more money for the border to fulfill [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=258.14s)]
*  some of Donald Trump's campaign promises sooner than later. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=263.86s)]
*  So that budget battle is ongoing and continue. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=267.9s)]
*  The deadline, though, I should mention is March 14th. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=270.46s)]
*  That's when something has to be passed in order to avoid a government shutdown, Luca. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=273.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, clock is ticking. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=277.78s)]
*  Torian, right now the House Oversight Committee is looking at government fraud and waste, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=279.34s)]
*  and along with the role Doge is playing in trying to root out all of that, Elon Musk [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=284.78s)]
*  has posted a lot about fraud and waste, but provided very little detail. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=290.21999999999997s)]
*  Did Doge give any details on what was discovered? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=295.86s)]
*  Not necessarily. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=301.66s)]
*  They've been talking in broad strokes about some things that they found, notably, and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=302.66s)]
*  this was something that Elon had to walk back. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=309.98s)]
*  They mentioned the fact that $50 million went to Gaza for condoms. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=312.7s)]
*  Reports showed that that just wasn't the case. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=319.02000000000004s)]
*  So Elon Musk, during a press conference at the White House yesterday, said that he won't [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=320.58000000000004s)]
*  always get things correct. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=324.62s)]
*  He says he'll walk back, gladly be transparent about walking back anything that he has wrong. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=326.26s)]
*  But this is what Democrats are asking for. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=330.86s)]
*  They're saying be completely transparent with what you're saying. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=332.26s)]
*  These facts that you're throwing out should be backed up with line items in previous budgets [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=335.1s)]
*  that they just haven't found yet. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=339.54s)]
*  What's happening in this hearing, though, is Democrats also questioning the legality [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=341.3s)]
*  of some of these wide-reaching actions, executive actions coming out of the president's office. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=345.42s)]
*  Again, it is Congress who holds the purse. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=349.98s)]
*  Republicans are saying they support this, so they will likely qualify any changes made [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=353.65999999999997s)]
*  or actions made by the president into law, likely through this budget reconciliation [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=357.82s)]
*  process. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=362.14s)]
*  But Democrats are saying let the courts handle this. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=363.14s)]
*  They're supporting the mini-litigation that's coming out of this because they believe that [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=365.3s)]
*  what's happening right now is pretty unconstitutional. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=369.9s)]
*  Torian Small, once again, thank you for your time today. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloO7o_BjVc&t=373.14s)]
