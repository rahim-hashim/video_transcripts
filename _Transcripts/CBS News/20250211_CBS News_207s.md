# Trump warns Hamas that "all hell is going to break out" if hostages aren't released Saturday
**CBS News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE)
*  A stark warning to Hamas from President Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=0.0s)]
*  Last night, he set a deadline for the release of all remaining hostages in Gaza and warned [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=4.12s)]
*  there will be consequences if they don't. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=9.6s)]
*  I would say Saturday at 12, we want them all back. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=11.92s)]
*  I'm speaking for myself. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=15.72s)]
*  Israel can override it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=17.32s)]
*  But for myself, Saturday at 12 o'clock, and if they're not here, all hell is going to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=19.16s)]
*  break out. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=25.92s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Natalie Brand is following this for us from the White House this morning. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=27.56s)]
*  Natalie, that ultimatum came when the president was signing executive orders. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=31.64s)]
*  But give us a bit of context in how this came up and what else was said. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=36.28s)]
*  Yeah, he was signing those orders and then taking questions from reporters. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=41.12s)]
*  And one journalist asked him about the new reports that Hamas was going to be postponing [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=46.68s)]
*  the release of the next round of hostages. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=52.82s)]
*  When the president started talking about the conditions of the hostages that have been [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  released so far, saying, you know, they've been in poor health, emaciated. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=60.28s)]
*  And then he went on to deliver this ultimatum, saying that he wants all hostages released [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=65.58s)]
*  by noon on Saturday or else, he said, all hell will break out. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  Now, when pressed by reporters, when asked what that would mean, he said, they'll find [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=75.56s)]
*  out, you'll find out. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=81.36s)]
*  He didn't really give a lot of details, but did repeat a couple different times this deadline [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=83.72s)]
*  of Saturday at noon. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=88.88s)]
*  Although, Errol, it's important to note that he also said Israel could override it, that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=90.16s)]
*  ultimately this is their decision. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=94.72s)]
*  And this comes as both sides, including White House mediators, are trying to keep this ceasefire [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=97.76s)]
*  agreement together. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  Hamas had accused Israel of violating it by not letting some Palestinians return to the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=105.48s)]
*  north, also saying that they were coming under attack of gunfire. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=112.52s)]
*  Well, Israel has said that if the release of additional hostages is postponed, that [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=116.28s)]
*  would be a clear violation, putting the military forces there on high alert. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=121.64s)]
*  Yeah, the agreement is delicate as it is. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=126.88s)]
*  I also want to ask you about the new federal ruling yesterday. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=129.48s)]
*  It blocked what could have been some potentially steep cuts to medical research. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=133.8s)]
*  What's the latest on that front? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=139.0s)]
*  Yeah, once again, a federal judge has put Trump administration changes on pause while [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=141.24s)]
*  it further considers this case. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=147.28s)]
*  This was funding changes by NIH, the National Institutes of Health, to research grant recipients, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=150.28s)]
*  universities or research institutes conducting scientific research, cancer research. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  to cut down or cap indirect costs, things like money going towards facilities, equipment [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=165.76s)]
*  overhead. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=172.4s)]
*  NIH said in a memo that it would be saving around four billion dollars a year. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=173.4s)]
*  But these research institutes and state attorneys general from democratic states with big universities [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=179.6s)]
*  that benefit from these grants say that, you know, that money for facilities is critical [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=185.88s)]
*  to keeping the lab lights on and conducting cancer research, their life saving research. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=190.72s)]
*  So once again, this is in court with a hearing scheduled, another hearing for later next [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=196.76s)]
*  week to hear further arguments on this. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=202.44s)]
*  All right, Natalie Brand, with all of that, thank you very much. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2rHgPd_EE&t=204.48s)]
