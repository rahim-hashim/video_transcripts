# Trump says he may get rid of FEMA, meets with Hurricane Helene first responders
**CBS News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0)
*  Happening right now, President Trump is sitting down with Hurricane Helene first responders as part of his first trip since taking office. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=0.0s)]
*  And we have some breaking news from the president on the future of FEMA. Let's take a listen from just moments ago. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=8.0s)]
*  I'll also be signing an executive order to begin the process of fundamentally reforming and overhauling FEMA or maybe getting rid of FEMA. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=14.0s)]
*  I think, frankly, FEMA is not good. I think when you have a problem like this, I think you want to go and whether it's a Democrat or Republican governor, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=22.0s)]
*  you want to use your state to fix it and not waste time calling FEMA. And then FEMA gets here and they don't know the area. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=32.0s)]
*  They've never been to the area and they want to give you rules that you've never heard about. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=39.0s)]
*  They want to bring people that aren't as good as the people you already have. And FEMA has turned out to be a disaster. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=44.0s)]
*  And you could go back a long way. You could go back to Louisiana. You could go back to some of the things that took place in Texas. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=51.0s)]
*  It turns out to be the state that ends up doing the work. It just complicates it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=58.0s)]
*  I think we're going to recommend that FEMA go away. And we pay directly. We pay a percentage to the state. But the state should fix this. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=62.0s)]
*  If the state did this from the beginning, it would have been a lot better situation. I think you guys agree with that, right? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=70.0s)]
*  So I just want to tell that I say that Asheville, I know it well. It's a great place. So we're going to have it be a great place again. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=76.0s)]
*  That was the one that was most severely affected. But North Carolina is going to come back bigger, better, stronger than ever before. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=83.0s)]
*  And you're going to be very thankful. And you've already seen I know that it really began four days ago, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=93.0s)]
*  but you've already seen more action than you have in the last three months. And we're going to get it together. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=99.0s)]
*  We're informing the Army Corps of Engineers to get going because you have a lot of river breaks and a lot of areas that you're going to need some pretty big work. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=105.0s)]
*  And they're on their way. They're going to be working very much harder than they've been working in the past. And we're going to take care of it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=115.0s)]
*  Any questions from the press of any of the congressmen, governor, anybody? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=123.0s)]
*  The Press. Can you say more about signing an executive order to get rid of FEMA? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=130.0s)]
*  The President. FEMA has been a very big disappointment. They cost a tremendous amount of money. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=138.0s)]
*  It's very bureaucratic and it's very slow. Other than that, we're very happy with them. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=144.0s)]
*  Okay. And I think it's I think when there's a when there's a problem with the state, I think that that problem should be taken care of by the state. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=150.0s)]
*  That's what we have states for. They take care of problems and a governor can handle something very quickly. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=160.0s)]
*  You know, one of the things I've noticed because I've been doing this for a while and we had a pretty good FEMA, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=165.0s)]
*  but I also noticed that when they come, they end up in arguments of they're fighting all the time over who does what. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=171.0s)]
*  It's just it's just not a good system. This system is so beautifully designed over 250 years, approximately, you know, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=178.0s)]
*  and we'll soon be celebrating the 250th year. It's going to be a very big celebration, but it's been designed very well. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=187.0s)]
*  And we're going to leave it that way. When North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Tennessee, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=195.0s)]
*  when everybody knows the governor of Tennessee, I think everybody do you know everybody here pretty much. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=201.0s)]
*  He's I never thought of it, but you're right over the ridge. So you're here to help. That's great. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=209.0s)]
*  The people in this region, including Tennessee, the people of Appalachia are grateful that you are here and that you haven't forgotten. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=215.0s)]
*  And there are other disasters, but this one was enormous for both North Carolina and Tennessee. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=224.0s)]
*  So thank you. You know, I've seen a lot of disasters and this when I came, I came here right after the day after. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=229.0s)]
*  And when I came here, I couldn't believe it. Actually, I couldn't believe the damage. And I've seen a lot of them. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=235.0s)]
*  This was this was more like a tornado than it was what we witnessed. So we're going to get it very much, very much taken care of. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=241.0s)]
*  Good job. That's nice that you can. And so you call it right. You're right over the ridge, right? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=250.0s)]
*  I like Tennessee, too. Let's see. Where did I get more votes? Tennessee or North Carolina? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=255.0s)]
*  I hate to tell you, North Carolina. It was Tennessee. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=260.0s)]
*  There's one of the counties in this disaster that had 88 percent for you. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=264.0s)]
*  88 percent. Yeah, that's the people are just incredible people. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=268.0s)]
*  So do you have any questions? Press president. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=273.0s)]
*  You talk about conditions being placed on a California phone right in the light. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=276.0s)]
*  Are there any conditions that you're going to put on a to North Carolina? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=280.0s)]
*  We're going to do a lot for North Carolina. They've been very slow. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=284.0s)]
*  I don't know why it's been so bad. This has been one of the worst I've seen. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=288.0s)]
*  Katrina, of course, you know, was somebody something that obviously I was a long time ago. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=293.0s)]
*  That was not good. But this has been very slow. I don't know if that was for political reasons because they lost the state. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=299.0s)]
*  You know, Biden lost the state, maybe felt he doesn't care. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=305.0s)]
*  And maybe there were other reasons. I don't know. But this has been very slow. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=309.0s)]
*  By any standard, this has been very slow. And we're going to we're going to make up for lost time. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=312.0s)]
*  No conditions you're going to push for aid. Well, in California, I have a condition in California. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=317.0s)]
*  We want them to have voter ID so the people have a voice because right now the people don't have a voice because you don't know who's voting. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=322.0s)]
*  And it's very corrupt. And we also want them to release the water. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=328.0s)]
*  If they released the water, they wouldn't have had a problem if they released the water when I told them to because I told them to do it seven years ago. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=333.0s)]
*  If they would have done it, you wouldn't have had the problem that you had. You might have you might not have even had a fire. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=341.0s)]
*  So but here I don't have that. It's a different thing. You got hit by a storm. The people are incredible. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=346.0s)]
*  They worked really well. Franklin was fantastic. And other groups, by the way, other groups came in that were also fantastic. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=353.0s)]
*  And other states came in Tennessee and a couple of others came in and they really helped. That's the way it's supposed to be. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=360.0s)]
*  No, this is a different kind of a thing. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=365.0s)]
*  About what? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=372.0s)]
*  I haven't decided to see what it is. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=376.0s)]
*  I'm disappointed that Senator Schiff hasn't joined you on this trip. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=378.0s)]
*  It's reported he invited Senator Schiff to join you on this trip and he was too busy. Are you disappointed? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=383.0s)]
*  I don't know. I was told that Schiff was going to travel with us to California. I wasn't thrilled, to be honest with you. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=388.0s)]
*  And I saw him last night on television. It looks like he got hit with a baseball bat or something. What happened to him? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=396.0s)]
*  Something happened to him. It was, well, it looked like he got hit. It looked like he got beat around. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=402.0s)]
*  But I'll ask Caroline to find out what happened to him. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=408.0s)]
*  No, if he wanted to come out, I would have done that. But I don't know. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=412.0s)]
*  Somebody said that he wanted to come on the plane, but I think he's staying back for the votes. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=416.0s)]
*  There's some pretty good votes going on. Yeah. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=421.0s)]
*  For this one? For this one? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=427.0s)]
*  What timeline are you looking at and how would you do that? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=432.0s)]
*  Well, we're looking here. Here you're talking about. To start, we're going to start immediately timeline. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=435.0s)]
*  And to finish, it's going to be a period of time. You know, people are also rebuilding their houses. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=440.0s)]
*  How long does it take to build a house? Right? It takes a time. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=447.0s)]
*  And I want them to build houses bigger, better, nicer than they had before so they can have, at least they get something out of this disaster. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=450.0s)]
*  It was a real disaster. No timeline will be fast in terms of infrastructure. I think very fast. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=458.0s)]
*  I want to thank Elon because Elon was able to get us communication systems, as you know, Starlink. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=463.0s)]
*  We had no communication. The first day I got here, I was asked by one of the people, one of the really great representatives, professionals, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=471.0s)]
*  that is there any way you could get Starlink here because they had no communication whatsoever. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=479.0s)]
*  And I called up Elon Musk and he had, you know, hundreds of units brought here, like brought immediately. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=484.0s)]
*  And it's hard to get. They couldn't get them before. And that made a lot of difference. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=491.0s)]
*  I think it saved a lot of lives, actually. Yeah. Infrastructure wise, we'll do it quickly. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=495.0s)]
*  Sir, can you just talk about how long you think it might take to get rid of FEMA with the timeline on that? If you're going to roll it back? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=500.0s)]
*  I would say, look, as far as I'm concerned, I'm not really thinking about FEMA right now here. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=507.0s)]
*  I'm thinking about Michael Watley and I'm thinking about the three Congress people that you just heard from and also the other people in Congress. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=514.0s)]
*  And they'll be working with the governor. They'll be working with the governor. So that's what I see. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=524.0s)]
*  Change the subject real quickly. The Lake and Riley Act was signed by Mike Speaker Johnson yesterday. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=531.0s)]
*  When do you anticipate to sign that in the law? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=538.0s)]
*  Well, honored by that, Lake and Riley, I was there at the time and we had a big meeting with the parents right after that horrible thing took place. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=541.0s)]
*  And we have an act. You all know what that act represents. And it was a bipartisan bill. Many Democrats signed on to it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=549.0s)]
*  That's something that is a tribute to Lakin, a beautiful young lady who was killed viciously by an illegal alien. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=558.0s)]
*  And we passed a very powerful bill and it was just approved and we'll have a ceremony sometime very shortly. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=567.0s)]
*  I'll be signing it. In other words, if you're asking, I will definitely be signing it. Yeah. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=575.0s)]
*  Mr. President, the security detail for Anthony Fauci was terminated last night and I'm wondering if you have any comment on that? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=581.0s)]
*  About what? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=587.0s)]
*  The security detail for Anthony Fauci was terminated last night, sir. Do you have a comment? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=588.0s)]
*  No, I think, you know, when you work for government, at some point your security detail comes off and, you know, you can't have them forever. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=593.0s)]
*  So I think it's very standard. If it would be for somebody else who wouldn't be asking the question. The question is very fair. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=603.0s)]
*  But, you know, you work for government. We took some off other people too. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=610.0s)]
*  But you can't have a security detail for the rest of your life because you work for government. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=615.0s)]
*  Mr. President, can we take an answer? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=620.0s)]
*  Yeah, we'll see what happens. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=622.0s)]
*  Would you feel partially responsible if something were to happen to, say, Dr. Fauci or John Bolton? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=623.0s)]
*  No, no. You know, they all made a lot of money. They can hire their own security too. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=628.0s)]
*  All the people you're talking about, they can go out. I can give them some good numbers of very good security people. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=633.0s)]
*  They can hire their own security. They all made a lot of money. Fauci made a lot of money. They all did. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=639.0s)]
*  So if they, you know, felt that strongly, I think that certainly I would not take responsibility. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=645.0s)]
*  North Carolina is a state that relies on trade and manufacturing. Are you going to have an announcement on new tariffs coming soon? Is there a timeline now? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=652.0s)]
*  Yeah, the tariffs are going to make our country rich. We're going to be a rich, rich country very soon. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=660.0s)]
*  Tariffs are going to make it rich in competence. We have common sense, competence and tariffs. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=666.0s)]
*  The word tariff is one of the most beautiful words in the dictionary. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=672.0s)]
*  Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary of the United Kingdom... [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFQJklFHE0&t=676.0s)]
