# USAID to merge into State Department with major budget cuts
**CBS News:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI)
*  All right, we want to bring you some breaking news of the future of the U.S. agency for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=0.0s)]
*  international development. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=3.4s)]
*  A reminder for our viewers, this morning staffers were told not to come into work today at the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=5.12s)]
*  agency's D.C. headquarters. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=10.32s)]
*  U.S. aid dispenses billions of dollars every year across the world to tackle poverty, diseases, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=12.56s)]
*  and respond to natural disasters. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=17.84s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News Senior White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=19.68s)]
*  With the very latest on all of this, what more can you tell us? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=22.72s)]
*  Hi there. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=28.0s)]
*  My sources are telling me this morning that USAID will be merged into the State Department. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=29.08s)]
*  It will still exist as an international aid entity, but it will be folded into the State [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=35.88s)]
*  Department. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=41.76s)]
*  It sounds like the situation is still fluid, but the discussions today are that there would [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=42.8s)]
*  be a significant reduction in the workforce. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=48.3s)]
*  And it also sounds like they're discussing cutting funding for this humanitarian aid [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=52.0s)]
*  organization, but the amount of funding cuts are still fluid. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=56.28s)]
*  The other piece of information that my colleague Sarah Cook and I gained today was the reason [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=60.2s)]
*  why the headquarters are shut down right now. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=65.68s)]
*  We were told that it's because of a security incident. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  There was a case where some staffers at the USAID, including a political appointee, someone [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=72.08s)]
*  that President Trump himself had appointed for USAID, had tried to block some of those [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=78.28s)]
*  government efficiency officials from entering the building and accessing certain information. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  Those officials have caused an unsafe condition, according to my sources, and that's why headquarters [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=90.12s)]
*  were shut down today. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=96.74000000000001s)]
*  So it doesn't mean that the agency is shutting down completely. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=98.30000000000001s)]
*  It's a temporary shutdown, but separately it will be merged into the State Department. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  Jennifer Jacobs, thank you so much for that update. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  Again, we're going to have very latest on the USAID merging with the State Department [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=109.8s)]
*  coming up later on in this show. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZPCy_irHQI&t=114.12s)]
