# California burn zones now facing landslide threats
**CBS News:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s)
*  The Palisades fire is 21% contained this morning and the critical threat of new [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=0.0s)]
*  fires has ended for now. Yeah, but there's also another danger for people [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=4.8s)]
*  in the burn zones that they need to watch out for. KCAT News reporter Rick [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=8.88s)]
*  Montanez live in Pacific Palisades where a home that survived the fire got split [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=11.6s)]
*  in half by a landslide. I mean, just so awful to see Rick. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=16.6s)]
*  Right, Chris Rudebay. I mean, it is incredible really to understand that so [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=22.0s)]
*  much of this neighborhood burned and this home was just crushed by that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=26.08s)]
*  moving earth. You see where the wall has buckled and then we go up to the home. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=29.88s)]
*  The windows shattered right there near the front balcony that overlooks the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  ocean and the house just split right in half when all the earth came moving [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=37.56s)]
*  down in it. We're not sure exactly when that happened, though. Let's show you [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=42.08s)]
*  some video from overhead. Skycal flew over the property to check out the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=45.16s)]
*  damage. I mean, this survey is pretty incredible here. The home is on the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=49.04s)]
*  cliffs above PCH on Castle Amer Drive and Stretto Way. This is right near PCH [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=53.48s)]
*  and sunset. Now, no one is sure. Like I said, when exactly the landslide [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  happened, but one thing is clear. The home survived the fire only to be [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  taken out like this. You could see in the aerial video the scar in the earth [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=67.6s)]
*  from where the where everything slid just above this home. Now we want to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=71.64s)]
*  show you this too. I checked online. The home was listed as a rental on Zillow [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=76.67999999999999s)]
*  just over two months ago. This listing has it as a one bedroom, one bath [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=81.12s)]
*  property. You'll see in the before image here 1000 square feet for this home [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  going for $14,000 a month. They say it was renovated in 2021 and it has access [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  to the beach. Incredible views, of course, just like so many other homes [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=97.16s)]
*  lost in this area since the fire last Tuesday. Now we've seen landslides [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=100.76s)]
*  along the coastal cliffs before, but now since this fire, the risk is even [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=105.28s)]
*  greater, especially when Southern California gets some rain eventually. So [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=109.44s)]
*  as we come back live, I want to point out to there is a lot of mud here in [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=113.8s)]
*  front of the home and some water that is flowing. Not a lot, but that may be a [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=116.96s)]
*  telling sign of what possibly brought this landslide on to crush this home. Of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=121.96s)]
*  course, landslides moving earth mudslides, debris flows. Those are all [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  concerns that will be in these communities when we eventually get some [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=131.68s)]
*  rain because of all the scorched earth around it. So certainly something that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=136.32s)]
*  everyone has to be aware of. But it's quite stunning to see this home [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=140.56s)]
*  survived the fire only to be destroyed by a landslide. The damage here [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=145.04s)]
*  certainly done either way. It happened reporting live in Pacific Palisades. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=150.76s)]
*  Rick Montanez, K Cal News. Yeah, just talk about emotional whiplash, right? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=154.72s)]
*  Okay, Rick, thank you so much. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PTuybYoh3s&t=158.66s)]
