# Did Macron's meeting with Trump impact U.S. position on Ukraine-Russia war?
**CBS News:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY)
*  President Trump is calling his meeting with French counterpart, his French counterpart, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=0.0s)]
*  an important step toward ending the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=5.4s)]
*  Macron reiterated that France and the US, along with European leaders, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=8.24s)]
*  are committed to reaching lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=12.68s)]
*  while outlining how Europe would take on a larger role. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=16.04s)]
*  And to talk more about that meeting, let's bring in CBS News senior White House correspondent, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=19.96s)]
*  Weijia Jiang. Weijia, great to connect with you again this morning. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=24.28s)]
*  I was fascinated to see not just what was said in the Oval Office, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=27.84s)]
*  but the body language between the French president and the US president, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=31.04s)]
*  the hand on Macron's knee that he picked up and placed back to Trump. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=34.84s)]
*  Did anything substantive come out of the meeting, as far as we can tell? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=39.92s)]
*  Right, I mean, these two leaders have been working together for so many years, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  and they've always had a very warm relationship, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=49.64s)]
*  which is exactly why they describe the meeting as friendly and productive. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=52.72s)]
*  But in terms of anything substantive, that's a little bit trickier, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=56.92s)]
*  because they don't exactly see eye to eye with how to move forward with Ukraine. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=60.6s)]
*  Of course, the president putting immense pressure on President Zelensky [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=65.84s)]
*  to sign a peace deal, and that does not seem intimate at this point so far, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=69.64s)]
*  because Zelensky has been left out of the talks between the US and Russia. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=75.92s)]
*  But Macron did talk at length about what needs to be done to get there. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  And he said, you know, it really is all about security assurances for Ukraine, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=85.04s)]
*  because they've been in this boat before and they've seen how Russia has violated terms in the past. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=89.68s)]
*  And so it's about getting an ireclad agreement, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=95.4s)]
*  which at the end of the day is what Trump wants as well, Errol. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=97.84s)]
*  So the two also participated in a call with other leaders of G7 countries. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  That unit is going to be really important to decide how to bolster Ukraine if the war comes to an end. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=106.6s)]
*  And then domestically, Weijia, these massive cuts to the federal workforce [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=114.24s)]
*  are still something we're trying to gauge the scope of. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  Any lawmakers seeing significant pushback from constituents, as far as you can tell? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=121.96s)]
*  Absolutely, Errol. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=127.6s)]
*  We have been covering various town halls across the country with Republican lawmakers [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=128.56s)]
*  who now have to answer to their constituents, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=133.44s)]
*  because it's not just Democrats who are federal workers, but Republicans too. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=136.28s)]
*  In fact, we interviewed one man who voted for Trump, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=140.04s)]
*  and now he is stunned by how much power he has. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=143.44s)]
*  And these Americans are expressing their frustration and outrage to the lawmakers, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=146.4s)]
*  asking, why aren't you doing more, essentially, blaming members of Congress for not really checking Trump's power here? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=152.96s)]
*  And one lawmaker, Rich McCormick, down in Georgia, after his town hall [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=161.92s)]
*  and after he heard from dozens of angry people admitted yesterday during a podcast [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=167.28s)]
*  that he does think things are moving too fast [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=172.76s)]
*  and that there needs to be an impact study on the departments with all these mass firings, Errol. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=175.32s)]
*  So we will see if it has any impact in practice, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=180.04s)]
*  but certainly they are feeling the heat to do something about how their constituents are feeling. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=184.96s)]
*  Yeah, you're exactly right about that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=190.56s)]
*  Weijia Zhang, thank you so much. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BLhjGk3OLY&t=191.96s)]
