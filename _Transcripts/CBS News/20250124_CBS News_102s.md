# Trump says he's ready to meet Putin to secure end to war in Ukraine
**CBS News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM)
*  And some other big stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=0.0s)]
*  At least three people have been killed in Ukraine [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=1.4000000000000001s)]
*  after Russia launched a wave of drones [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=4.12s)]
*  across the country overnight. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=6.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, South Korea's military says it suspects [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=8.96s)]
*  North Korea is preparing to send more troops [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=12.08s)]
*  to aid Russia in its war with Ukraine [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=14.92s)]
*  after suffering losses on the battlefield. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=17.64s)]
*  And the fighting does continue. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=20.44s)]
*  President Trump is urging Russia's Vladimir Putin [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=22.2s)]
*  to meet as soon as possible to bring an end to the war. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=25.28s)]
*  Our Holly Williams brings us more from Ukraine. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=28.48s)]
*  A recent poll here in Ukraine found that just over half [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  of its people would like to negotiate an end to the war. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=36.08s)]
*  And that is up dramatically since the beginning [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=39.68s)]
*  of the conflict back in 2022. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  It's also not surprising after three years of brutal war [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=44.64s)]
*  and with Ukraine thought to be running short of manpower. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  But Ukraine is adamant that there cannot be a ceasefire [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=52.32s)]
*  without security guarantees from the international community. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=55.84s)]
*  For instance, NATO membership, which would commit the US [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=59.28s)]
*  to defending Ukraine if it's attacked again. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=62.88s)]
*  And that is the fear here, that negotiations with President Trump [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=65.84s)]
*  could give Vladimir Putin credibility [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=70.16s)]
*  and a face-saving way out of the current conflict. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=72.68s)]
*  That Putin could agree to a ceasefire, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=76.0s)]
*  use it to buy time to rebuild his depleted military [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=78.36s)]
*  and then reinvade Ukraine at a later date. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  The other thing that many Ukrainians have told us here [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=85.36s)]
*  is that no matter what happens, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=88.08s)]
*  they need American weapons to defend themselves. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=89.84s)]
*  The bottom line is that at least some Ukrainians [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=93.32s)]
*  would like a ceasefire, but they need to see the details. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=95.76s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=99.6s)]
*  Holly, thank you for that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7u7flygBM&t=100.76s)]
