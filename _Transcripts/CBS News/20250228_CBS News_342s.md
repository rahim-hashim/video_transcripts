# Trump administration asks Zelenskyy to leave White House after tense exchange
**CBS News:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY)
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has now left the White House after things got heated with President Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=0.0s)]
*  The afternoon started with pleasantries when Mr. Trump greeted his Ukrainian counterpart, but that energy quickly dissolved when the visit moved to the Oval Office. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=7.0s)]
*  What was expected to be a photo opportunity between the two leaders became a contentious back and forth. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=16.0s)]
*  The two clashed over the history and future of the war in Ukraine, and now there are questions swirling about the potential for a rare earth minerals deal that the two leaders were expected to sign this afternoon. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=22.0s)]
*  I'm telling you, you will feel influence. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=52.0s)]
*  From the very beginning of the war, from the very beginning of the war, I was understand. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=57.0s)]
*  I'm not playing cards. I'm very serious, Mr. President. I'm the president in work. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=67.0s)]
*  You're gambling with World War III. You're gambling with World War III. And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country, that's back to you far more than a lot of people said they should have. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=74.0s)]
*  Shortly after that meeting, the president took to Truth Social to say, quote, I've determined that President Zelensky is not ready for peace if America is involved because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=90.0s)]
*  He went on to say, I don't want advantage. I want peace. He disrespected the United States of America and its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for peace. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=103.0s)]
*  And this afternoon's joint press conference was also quickly canceled. For more on all of this, let's bring in CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=114.0s)]
*  Nancy, this was a true moment in history. It was spicy. I mean, how unprecedented is this type of exchange filled with so much tension? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=123.0s)]
*  Completely unprecedented, Chanel, and things keep going from bad to worse. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=132.0s)]
*  We just learned that the president essentially kicked Zelensky out of the White House after that exchange. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=136.0s)]
*  We're told that Zelensky and his aides wanted to try to smooth things over, but the president wasn't having it and told him to leave. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=144.0s)]
*  There was a lunch that had been prepared for these two leaders to eat as they continued to negotiate behind closed doors. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=153.0s)]
*  That lunch went uneaten and Zelensky departed. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=160.0s)]
*  He's now slated to give a speech at the Hudson Institute, a research organization here in D.C. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=165.0s)]
*  It's chaired by former presidential candidate, Nancy Nikki Haley. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=171.0s)]
*  And as far as we know, that speech is still on and he's perhaps going to be able to give his side of the story before he departs the U.S. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=178.0s)]
*  But this is not ending in any way the way that Zelensky had hoped when he flew here to the United States, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=188.0s)]
*  thinking that he was going to be signing a minerals deal with the president of the United States and talking about the terms for a peace deal to come. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=196.0s)]
*  Right. So what happens with that rare mineral deal that was supposed to be discussed today? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=206.0s)]
*  It's completely up in the air at this point. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=212.0s)]
*  And as you read from President Trump's true social, he says Zelensky isn't ready for peace and he can come back when he is. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=215.0s)]
*  Now, President Trump has been known to change his mind before, so we'll see if that happens again. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=224.0s)]
*  He was actually sounding much more positive about that, about Zelensky yesterday than he had in the months and years before. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=231.0s)]
*  So anything is possible. But at this particular moment, Chanel, things could not be worse. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=239.0s)]
*  And it's definitely going to be a cause for great concern for European officials in particular who were hoping that things were now heading in the right direction [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=246.0s)]
*  after weeks of President Trump sounding like he was more on Putin's side than Zelensky's. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=257.0s)]
*  And speaking of that, Nancy, earlier this week, the president we know met with other European leaders. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=264.0s)]
*  Could what happened today impact America's relationship with some of those other European nations? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=269.0s)]
*  Sure. Although European nations have have other concerns. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=275.0s)]
*  For example, President Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on all European countries, in fact, all countries around the world, reciprocal tariffs. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=281.0s)]
*  And so they are worried about heading those off and may be reluctant to criticize President Trump too directly when they are also quietly negotiating [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=291.0s)]
*  with the White House to try to head off those tariffs that could hurt not only U.S. consumers, but foreign consumers as well. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=301.0s)]
*  Great concerns about a trade war with some of our closest allies. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=311.0s)]
*  And so, you know, we saw Keir Starmer, the prime minister of the UK in the Oval Office yesterday. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=316.0s)]
*  And while we know that he has a very different view of the Ukraine war than President Trump does, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=323.0s)]
*  he really downplayed any disagreement because he is working so hard behind the scenes to head off those tariffs that he believes would hurt his economy. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=329.0s)]
*  OK, Nancy, thank you so much. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvn0q89ONY&t=339.0s)]
