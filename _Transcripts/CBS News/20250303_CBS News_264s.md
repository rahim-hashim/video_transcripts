# USAID worker put on leave speaks out on DOGE cuts
**CBS News:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo)
*  One of the first federal agencies affected by the Trump administration's efforts to downsize the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=0.0s)]
*  federal workforce was the U.S. Agency for International Development, which oversees aid [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=4.32s)]
*  programs around the world. You may have heard us refer to it as USAID, including those intended to [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=8.88s)]
*  help Palestinians in Gaza. Dan McDonald joins us now. He spent most of his career at USAID's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Middle East Bureau and was put on leave in February and expects to be fired April 24th. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=20.32s)]
*  Dan, thanks for being here. And we're sorry we're talking to you under these circumstances. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=26.16s)]
*  Can you go ahead and walk us through what you did at USAID, what that work meant to you? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=31.04s)]
*  Yeah, sure. So as you mentioned, I worked in the Middle East Bureau at USAID for the last four [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=36.32s)]
*  years. And the primary portfolio that I was on was implementing the Middle East Partnership for [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  Peace Act, which focused on bringing Israelis and Palestinians together, both businesses and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  civil society, in order to build the trust necessary to form a durable peace. And MEPA, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=51.6s)]
*  Middle East Partnership for Peace Act, was signed by President Trump in 2020. A lot of bipartisan [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=57.28s)]
*  support and a lot of my work was making sure that the Congress of both parties were comfortable [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=62.24s)]
*  with the approach we were taking and that the work we were doing was carefully measured and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=67.12s)]
*  had the impact it was intended to have. And you've worked under both Democratic and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  Republican administrations. So what is concerning to you about the way this administration is making [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=76.32s)]
*  these cuts? Yeah, yeah, you're right. I began my career under the Obama administration and then [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=81.28s)]
*  worked under the Trump and then Biden administration. And we absolutely expect [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=88.88s)]
*  at the beginning of a new administration that there will be changes. In the first Trump [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  administration, there was a reduction in prioritization of things like family planning, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=96.88s)]
*  but an increase in emphasis on protecting religious and ethnic minorities, including, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=101.36s)]
*  for example, Christians and Yazidis that were facing violence from ISIS in northern Iraq. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=105.6s)]
*  That's a normal part of the business of what we do. And we were expecting that again this time [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=109.92s)]
*  around to work with new leadership and to see the president sort of steer the ship of USAID and the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  rest of the federal government in a direction that aligns with the will of the American people. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=120.08s)]
*  What's different about what happened this time around is that we didn't have any of that sort [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  of process. The administration, and we believe driven largely by Elon Musk's priorities, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=127.68s)]
*  really took a sledgehammer to the work we're doing. They, as of last week, slashed over 90 [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=134.0s)]
*  of USAID's programs around the world with no warning, pulling the rug out from underneath [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=140.0s)]
*  our partners, many of whom are doing immediately life-saving work. Almost all of my colleagues [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=143.84s)]
*  have lost their jobs or will lose their jobs very shortly. And it's not a natural place for a civil [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=149.44s)]
*  servant to be speaking so publicly, but all of the traditional channels for dissent that we would [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=155.28s)]
*  normally have, chances to engage with our bosses and our leadership to object or to explain the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=160.64s)]
*  value of our work, I would say, have been taken away. And so I feel compelled not to speak. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=165.84s)]
*  Is it your contention, Dan, that they are doing these and the sledgehammer, in your opinion, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  without proper due process? Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. These programs are appropriated [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=173.52s)]
*  by funds from Congress. USAID's established by Congress. Our staffing pattern's approved by [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  Congress. And to go after them in such a blunt and broad-based way is a clear violation of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  a number of statutes in addition to just sort of the norms that have governed the way we do [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=192.8s)]
*  things for many years. I have to be quick with you, but you have said that this is about more [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=197.36s)]
*  than one agency. It's more about the personal suffering of employees you just mentioned against [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  the will of the American people. Can you elaborate on that and what you mean by that? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=205.52s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely I can. Everyone at USAID comes from some part of this country. When you ask [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=209.36s)]
*  people where they're from, they don't say the region here. They say Michigan, Florida, Texas, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=213.52s)]
*  whatever, right? And we come here because we want to do the work that those folks sent us to do. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=218.0s)]
*  We know it's their work because their elected members of Congress have told us, right? They've [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=223.2s)]
*  appropriated these dollars. They've established USAID. And if we're a ship, right, the president's [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=228.08s)]
*  steering it, but the Congress funds it, the Congress sets the charter, and we're that crew, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=233.36s)]
*  right? And so the president and folks like Elon Musk especially don't have the right to just sink [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=237.04s)]
*  that ship without consent of the American people, and that consent is gained by engaging with [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=241.36s)]
*  Congress. And that just hasn't happened. Well Dan McDonald, it's our understanding you're [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=245.36s)]
*  to be married soon. I understand that with that comes a lot of financial strife, but we wish you [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=251.12s)]
*  and your fiance and your future the best of luck. Thank you for speaking with us. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=256.64s)]
*  Thanks so much, Lindsay. Really glad to be here. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojtd4-m0oo&t=261.6s)]
