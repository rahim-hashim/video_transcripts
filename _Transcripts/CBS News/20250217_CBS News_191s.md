# Former USDA worker fired by Trump administration shares her story
**CBS News:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E)
*  The Department of Agriculture is one of the many federal agencies hit by President Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=0.0s)]
*  mass layoffs. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=4.0600000000000005s)]
*  According to a number of staffers, emails started going out on Thursday without warning, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  leaving supervisors off guard and potentially hundreds of people without a job. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=9.6s)]
*  Tabitha Panis is one of the many USDA employees suddenly informed their job was terminated [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=14.4s)]
*  last week, and she joins me now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Tabitha, I'm sorry we're speaking under these circumstances. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=21.44s)]
*  I know emotionally how hard something like this can be and the stock you have to take. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=24.76s)]
*  How has this process gone for you and what are your biggest concerns now about taking [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  care of yourself and your family? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=35.1s)]
*  Hi, thank you so much, Lindsay, for having me. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=36.72s)]
*  I really appreciate your kind words. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=39.88s)]
*  It is a very challenging time. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's kind of been up and coming that our positions are not secure. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=43.44s)]
*  But considering that, you know, the Department of Agriculture is so important to our food [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=48.2s)]
*  security and our farmers in the Midwest, I was surprised to be terminated from this position. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=53.6s)]
*  So obviously I'm seeking different employment going forward, but, you know, still just kind [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=59.6s)]
*  of taking my time to process everything. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=66.64s)]
*  I want to ask you about something that you said, because there are people who believe [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  that the federal government does need to shrink. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=72.2s)]
*  But can you talk to us about the work you did and why you think it's such crucial work, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=74.72s)]
*  especially right now? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=78.56s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=80.56s)]
*  So with USDA, I was a natural resource specialist and I work with farmers and producers to help [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=81.56s)]
*  implement voluntary conservation practices on their land. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  Farmers come to our office to seek out our assistance and we work with them in their [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=92.92s)]
*  operation to help ensure that they are treating resource concerns and are profitable in doing [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=98.16s)]
*  so. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=104.84s)]
*  So one of the biggest resource concerns we work with in the state of Iowa is soils and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=106.38s)]
*  our, you know, soil health concerns. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=111.16s)]
*  We currently are in an eroding environment in the Midwest. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=115.16s)]
*  So it was tens of thousands of years of tall grass prairies that built our super high [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  top soils in the Midwest and is what makes our agriculture so, you know, profitable. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=126.8s)]
*  And we are losing those when we have annual row crops on the landscape. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=133.92s)]
*  We understand that we're losing soils. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=139.4s)]
*  So these soil health practices like cover crops, terraces, no till practices are super [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=140.92s)]
*  important for our farmers and they rely on us for that technical and financial assistance [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  to get that done. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=151.48s)]
*  Wow. And Tabitha, before we let you go, this has a human toll too. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=152.48s)]
*  I understand that there are some questions that you have, for example, health insurance. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=156.44s)]
*  I mean, something as simple that we take it, you know, take for granted. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  Can you elaborate on that a little bit as quickly as you can? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=163.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I mean, the termination letter was very informal and didn't have a lot of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=167.12s)]
*  information at all about my benefits moving forward. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=172.4s)]
*  So I'm still working with, waiting back for an email from my HR representative to see [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=176.0s)]
*  if they can answer any of my questions in that regard. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  Uncertain time Tabitha Panis, please let us know how you're doing in a little bit. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=184.72s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=188.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KLZg2CH7E&t=190.4s)]
