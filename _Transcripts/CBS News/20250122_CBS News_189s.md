# Nashville school shooting investigation underway
**CBS News:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A)
*  One student is dead and another wounded after a fellow student opened fire at a Tennessee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=0.0s)]
*  High School cafeteria. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=4.58s)]
*  This happened this morning at Antioch High School in Nashville. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=5.82s)]
*  The 17-year-old shooter is dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  From the investigation to this point, we know that at 11.09 a.m., a person who has been [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=14.66s)]
*  identified as a 17-year-old armed with a pistol fired multiple shots in the cafeteria of the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=21.42s)]
*  school. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=28.8s)]
*  Our video coordinating producer for CBS News' Crime and Public Safety Unit, Anna Schechter, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=29.8s)]
*  joins me now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=33.52s)]
*  What more are we learning about this? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=34.52s)]
*  Well, the investigation is ongoing. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=35.52s)]
*  As we've heard, one female student shot dead, another injured. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=38.44s)]
*  But the investigation into the shooter and his motive is very much alive right now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=42.92s)]
*  Looking at his online presence, there are deep dark places on the Internet where a lot [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=47.84s)]
*  of young people go. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=52.32s)]
*  Look at Wisconsin. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  had a lot of online activity, a lot of interest in accelerationism, which is the most extreme [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=56.12s)]
*  form of white supremacy. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=64.24s)]
*  So that's one thing that we're taking a look at is what was his online activity looking [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=67.2s)]
*  like. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  We're looking for gaming platforms, other social media platforms and investigators. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  Certainly, that is their main line of questioning now. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=79.88s)]
*  In addition to interviewing members of his family, anyone that he might have talked to [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=82.48s)]
*  or given a red flag to, there's going to be a postmortem of what signs were missed, certainly. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=86.84s)]
*  And I'm guessing investigators are also going to look into how the 17-year-old got access [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=91.64s)]
*  to a weapon. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=94.82000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=95.82000000000001s)]
*  Access to a weapon and brought that weapon inside the school. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=96.82000000000001s)]
*  Let's talk about the community here. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=99.28s)]
*  This is in Nashville. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=100.76s)]
*  Of course, we know about 30 minutes away by cars, the Covenant Catholic School, where [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=101.76s)]
*  there was a 2023 mass shooting tragically. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  It not only drew protests for gun control, but it also drew legislative action. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=109.08s)]
*  Can you talk to us about what we're seeing in Nashville and Tennessee as a whole? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=114.36s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=118.08s)]
*  Well, actually, student school administrators and teachers now can carry firearms for protection [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=119.08s)]
*  because of school shootings. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=125.92s)]
*  And this is a very controversial response to school shootings. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=127.44s)]
*  But we have seen more and more schools allowing for this. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=131.56s)]
*  That didn't factor into this case, but that is a response. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=136.52s)]
*  But there is a groundswell of activists in the Nashville area who are trying desperately [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  to fight gun violence at every level. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=145.32s)]
*  You have very loose gun laws in Tennessee, and it is one of the highest rates of deaths [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=149.28s)]
*  from gun violence in the country. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=155.12s)]
*  And just one more note while I have you. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=156.96s)]
*  There were school resource officers. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=158.88s)]
*  They weren't in the cafeteria at the time. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=161.2s)]
*  By the time they got there, the shooting had ended. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=162.44s)]
*  Some of these campuses can be pretty sprawling. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=164.72s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=166.68s)]
*  There were more than 2,000 students at this school. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=167.68s)]
*  So this was a very large high school with that cafeteria in the central area. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=169.72s)]
*  But it's hard to cover a whole building like that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=175.84s)]
*  Multiple classrooms, sports facilities. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=179.16s)]
*  And if you just have two or three officers, sometimes it's luck that they'll be in the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=182.0s)]
*  right place at the right time. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=186.24s)]
*  Anna Schechter, thank you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsdn2lwA75A&t=187.24s)]
