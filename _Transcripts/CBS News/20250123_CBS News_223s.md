# Federal judges slam Trump's Jan. 6 pardons
**CBS News:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI)
*  Following President Trump's sweeping clemency for January 6th defendants, federal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=0.0s)]
*  judges who presided over cases are letting their discontent be heard. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  U.S. District Judge Barrel Howell rebuked the president's claim of injustice, writing, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=9.0s)]
*  quote, this court cannot let stand the revisionist myth relayed in this presidential [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  pronouncement. That's his quote. Let's bring in CBS News digital politics reporter Melissa [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  Quinn. Melissa, great to have you here on America Decides. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=21.48s)]
*  What's your new reporting on how judges are handling the pardons and the executive orders [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=24.68s)]
*  from President Trump? Well, if you remember when President Trump issued his executive [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=29.720000000000002s)]
*  order on Monday, not only did he grant clemency to these 1500 January 6th defendants, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  but he also ordered the Justice Department to dismiss any pending indictments against [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=38.96s)]
*  roughly 300 of these defendants. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=43.72s)]
*  And this is where we're really hearing from these federal judges who have been overseeing [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=45.96s)]
*  these cases for the last four years. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  Now, the judges are granting these Justice Department requests to dismiss these pending [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=52.32s)]
*  indictments. But in doing so, they're issuing these very strongly worded orders where [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=57.2s)]
*  they're basically saying we cannot recast the events of January 6th in the way that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=62.440000000000005s)]
*  President Trump has trying to call it a day of love. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=68.28s)]
*  They're pointing to some of the evidence, the images, the videos that have surfaced in [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=71.16s)]
*  some of these cases and saying this was a day of violence. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=75.80000000000001s)]
*  This was a day in which 140 police officers were injured and we cannot rewrite the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=78.92s)]
*  history of that day. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=84.08s)]
*  So they're speaking out. But legally, does it have any weight for them to speak out if the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  president, with all of his executive power, says get rid of those cases? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=90.12s)]
*  Is that effectively the end of the story? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=94.56s)]
*  Well, yes, it is. And the judges are granting the request to toss out the indictments. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=96.44000000000001s)]
*  But I think what is notable here is that judges are not like public officials. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=100.84s)]
*  They're not writing in the pages of The Wall Street Journal. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=105.0s)]
*  They're not going on CNN or CBS and giving interviews talking about this is why I made [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  this decision. This is what I think about these current events. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=112.72s)]
*  Their opinions, their written orders are really where they are sort of showing their [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=115.6s)]
*  work. And I think that that is why you are seeing them here speak out so fervently [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=120.32s)]
*  against these pardons and saying I want to do one quote from Judge Tanya Chutkin, who [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=126.48s)]
*  oversaw President Trump's prosecution that has since been dismissed. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=131.04s)]
*  She said, dismissal cannot whitewash the blood, feces and terror that the mob left in [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=134.8s)]
*  its wake. So they are certainly taking the opportunity to speak out against this sort [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=141.16s)]
*  of downplaying of the events. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=146.6s)]
*  Is there a precedent for a president to dismiss pending cases, possible indictments [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=148.76s)]
*  before they even happen? Is that something we've ever seen in history? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=156.12s)]
*  Well, the president can certainly do whatever he wants. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=159.6s)]
*  And when it comes to the pardon power, I mean, that is expressly granted in the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=161.64s)]
*  Constitution. I think you are seeing this sort of pushback against the expansion of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=165.12s)]
*  that power that we've seen not only from President Trump as Democrats are saying this [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=170.6s)]
*  is going too far, but also the pardons that were issued by former President Biden in [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=175.2s)]
*  his final hours in office, granting those pardons to his family members and then prior [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=179.6s)]
*  to his son, Hunter Biden. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=184.56s)]
*  I'm told that you have some new reporting on how the judges, some of them at least, are [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=186.92s)]
*  concerned about their own safety. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=191.16s)]
*  Absolutely. And that is something that we have seen play out really over the last four [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  years. I mentioned Judge Chuckin. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=197.64s)]
*  She had protection by U.S. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=199.0s)]
*  Marshals. A woman from Texas was arrested shortly after President Trump was indicted. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=200.68s)]
*  The case was assigned to her and she left allegedly a very violent voicemail on [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=206.12s)]
*  Judge Chuckin's on her phone in her chambers. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=210.92s)]
*  So this is definitely something that the judges are worried about and have been dealing [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  with for quite some time. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=217.76s)]
*  Alyssa Quinn, thank you so much for your reporting. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=219.88s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6IqugOynLI&t=221.92s)]
