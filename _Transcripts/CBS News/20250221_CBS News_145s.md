# FBI Director Kash Patel has first full day on job, plans to implement major changes
**CBS News:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw)
*  This is the first day on the job for newly confirmed FBI director cash Patel his nomination passed the Senate yesterday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=0.0s)]
*  But just barely as changes to the bureau are already taking place [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=7.2s)]
*  Let's bring in Department of Justice correspondent Scott McFarlane for more on this Scott [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=11.48s)]
*  What are some of the major changes Patel has earmarked to transform the FBI starting now? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=16.04s)]
*  Errol during his confirmation hearings cash Patel said he would return the FBI to its quote [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=21.96s)]
*  Core mission and stop the politicization of the bureau [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=27.26s)]
*  The critics of the Trump administration would say the FBI had not deviated from its core mission and was not politicized [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=31.700000000000003s)]
*  So that's a bit of a political argument [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=37.5s)]
*  He's bringing and that's what concerns so many Trump critics that there is a Trump loyalist running the bureau [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  Which is supposed to be independent of politics and making non political arguments [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  But all of those norms seem to have been shattered when Chris, Ray [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=51.56s)]
*  Cash Patel's predecessor was forced out of the FBI at the very end of the Biden administration and the new president [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=56.36s)]
*  Nominated a new FBI director traditionally Errol [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=63.56s)]
*  There are 10 year terms for FBI directors so that they can transcend administrations and transcend politics [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=66.84s)]
*  So the question as cash Patel takes the oath at 430 p.m [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=74.02000000000001s)]
*  Eastern time today is will he be an independent voice as he's pledged as he did under questioning at the Senate or [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=77.2s)]
*  Will he be a Trump ally in that role and Scott it wasn't just Chris, Ray [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=84.76s)]
*  There were other senior DOJ officials also [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  Pushed out there was a list of those officials who worked on the January 6th [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=94.4s)]
*  Investigation so what does this mean for what cash Patel's FBI will do? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=99.88s)]
*  It's possible that list of 5,000 FBI employees and agents who are affiliated with the January 6th investigation [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=105.0s)]
*  It's possible that list makes its way to cash Patel's desk eventually [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=112.28s)]
*  I know a number of the agents on that list are worried about [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=116.41999999999999s)]
*  Retribution or being fired for following orders and investigating the attack on the US Capitol an attack [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=119.24s)]
*  Which is being rewritten as we speak in real time [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=125.16s)]
*  Whether cash Patel acts on that list is a different question for a different day [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=129.32s)]
*  But he is going to be in charge of the bureau its field offices nationwide its thousands of employees [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=133.34s)]
*  beginning tonight here in Washington [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  Scott McFarlane live from Washington for us Scott. Thank you [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvazdnFVvKw&t=141.56s)]
