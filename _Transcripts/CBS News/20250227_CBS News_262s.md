# Ukraine's future at center of Trump-Starmer meeting at White House
**CBS News:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U)
*  I want to bring in CBS News foreign correspondent Rami Nissencio to talk more about this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=0.0s)]
*  So Rami, what are you hearing from the U.K. side as to the prime minister's agenda for [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=6.0s)]
*  today's meeting? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=10.28s)]
*  Hey, yeah, Vlad. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=11.28s)]
*  Well, basically, on the general big-picture perspective, it's really to try to make sure [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=12.52s)]
*  that the U.S.-U.K. special relationship, right, from World War II, first off, doesn't go [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  trying to play what I'm couching as friendly defense of many things here in the U.K. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=25.0s)]
*  One, the British economy. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=31.6s)]
*  We know it hasn't been doing well already. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=33.36s)]
*  On national security through the lens of Ukraine and Russia. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=35.64s)]
*  And four, Keir Starmer's own political stability after attacks from Elon Musk. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=39.76s)]
*  So all of this happening against the backdrop of his visit to see Donald Trump. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=45.16s)]
*  Let's go ahead and take a listen to this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  So we want to strike a new partnership. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=52.44s)]
*  We share the view that our best days lie ahead. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  And you know, taking out a chainsaw isn't quite my style. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=59.32s)]
*  But we are stripping away red tape and bureaucracy. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=66.56s)]
*  We are reforming, permitting, getting things built, reducing barriers to investment and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=70.2s)]
*  growth. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=75.64s)]
*  And we're open for business, open for investment. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=76.64s)]
*  And we're determined to help U.S. innovators thrive in the United Kingdom. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=80.56s)]
*  So some laughs there, as you saw Keir Starmer there at the British ambassador's residence [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=86.2s)]
*  yesterday in Washington. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=91.32s)]
*  But perhaps it's also nervous laughter, him giving the stiff upper lip here, trying to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=92.78s)]
*  be positive, even though we know that he and Trump are politically opposite each other. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=97.8s)]
*  So Keir does go to the White House, though, with a carrot, you could say a tribute in [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=102.76s)]
*  his hand to offer Trump. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=107.48s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=109.32s)]
*  So, Keir, I'm curious about the current spending. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=110.32s)]
*  You mentioned that the current spending is $2.5 percent of GDP. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=113.32s)]
*  What's the current rate of that bump in U.K. defense spending that he announced two [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=117.32s)]
*  days ago? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=121.44s)]
*  The timing, obviously, notable, Vlad. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=122.44s)]
*  The question, though, will this bump be enough to appease Trump? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=124.84s)]
*  Current spending for defense, 2.3 percent of GDP. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=128.6s)]
*  The target in a couple years, 2.5 percent there. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=131.92s)]
*  Then the next target above that, 3 percent of GDP. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=134.8s)]
*  During this discussion that they're going to have tomorrow, we'll discuss this framework [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  for these mineral resources deal. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=141.11999999999998s)]
*  But again, Rami, it's the question that I asked you yesterday. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  If the United States is not going to guarantee the security of Ukraine, if they are also [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=148.38s)]
*  not willing to support their, at the later date, even if it's at a later date, their [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=155.56s)]
*  future entry into NATO, it's really, really hard to see what Zelensky is getting out of this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=166.48s)]
*  It appears to be much more important for Ukraine to get, Vlad, anything out of this from the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=167.48s)]
*  United States, from President Trump. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=175.04s)]
*  There's hope. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=177.39999999999998s)]
*  There's a lot of hope. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=178.39999999999998s)]
*  But it does seem that President Zelensky is backed into a corner and that he does not [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  have any kind of leverage when it comes to these aggressive words, the potential aggressive [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  that Donald Trump has been saying, has been threatening Ukraine, hoping that by giving [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=191.86s)]
*  the U.S. access to its mineral wealth, that it'll maybe tie the U.S. economically to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=197.42000000000002s)]
*  Ukraine and thereby providing some kind of de facto security guarantee against Russia. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=204.34s)]
*  That's the hope, right? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=210.34s)]
*  But Trump has already said that the U.S. would not give a security guarantee. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=211.54000000000002s)]
*  Zelensky has reiterated that it's crucial. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=217.18s)]
*  So we're seeing these two men talking past each other, saying the same thing over and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=218.85999999999999s)]
*  over and over again. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=224.46s)]
*  Last night in a video address, Zelensky said that guarantees of peace and security, that's [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=226.1s)]
*  key to ensuring Russia will not destroy the lives of other nations, him putting it on [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=230.5s)]
*  other nations, potentially Eastern Europe here, if Ukraine were to somehow fall. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=236.1s)]
*  Trump also poured cold water on hopes that Ukraine would join NATO under his watch. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=241.94s)]
*  He said that, quote, NATO, you can forget about that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=245.95999999999998s)]
*  So again, it seems like all the leverage is something that Donald Trump has and Zelensky [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  coming in, signing that deal. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  We just look ahead to tomorrow. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=256.4s)]
*  Yeah, indeed. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=258.12s)]
*  All right, Rami Nessencio reporting from London for us this morning. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=259.12s)]
*  Thanks, Rami. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3WgFD0xT9U&t=261.64s)]
