# Lawmakers react to Supreme Court upholding TikTok ban
**CBS News:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE)
*  So video to our monitors have our eyes trained solely and squarely on the Supreme Court for this part of our broadcast. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=0.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court move that upheld a ban of TikTok. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=6.32s)]
*  That ban is scheduled to go into effect on Sunday. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=9.4s)]
*  So literally TikTok for TikTok. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=13.24s)]
*  Take a look at just some of what Justice Neil Gorsuch said in his opinion on the ruling. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=14.92s)]
*  And this was in addition to the ruling. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=19.8s)]
*  He said, in part, whether this law will succeed in achieving its ends, I do not know. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=21.28s)]
*  But the question we face today is not the law's wisdom, only its constitutionality. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=26.8s)]
*  Given just a handful of days after oral argument and issue of an opinion, I, says Gorsuch, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=33.72s)]
*  cannot profess the kind of certainty that I would like to have about the arguments and the record before us. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=38.44s)]
*  All I can say, Gorsuch goes on to write, is that at this time and under these constraints, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=46.2s)]
*  the problem appears real and the response to it not constitutional. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=51.32s)]
*  So a reminder for our viewers right now, President Joe Biden, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=56.12s)]
*  he signed this bipartisan bill from Congress in April of last year that then got kicked up to the high court. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=59.96s)]
*  But now fast forward to today, President Joe Biden says he will not implement and he will not enforce the ban [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=65.52s)]
*  and will leave all those details squarely in the lap of Donald Trump. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=71.0s)]
*  Now, lawmakers who voted for this bill reacted to the ruling on Capitol Hill today. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=75.08s)]
*  We wanted to let you hear some of their initial reaction. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=78.6s)]
*  I think that's good from a rule of law point of view. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=81.84s)]
*  I thought TikTok's arguments were exceptionally weak. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=85.56s)]
*  Well, here's a couple of things. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=87.6s)]
*  Number one is that there's no need for TikTok to shut down if China will allow TikTok to be sold. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=88.84s)]
*  But for months now, Beijing has refused to entertain what I understand are multiple offers, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=94.44s)]
*  substantial offers to purchase TikTok from all kinds of different people. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=101.28s)]
*  And it doesn't have to be owned by an American company. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=104.52s)]
*  It just has to be owned by a company that is not subject to Beijing's control. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=106.92s)]
*  That's the problem with TikTok now. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=110.52s)]
*  Why is it a security threat was your question. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  And the answer is if you have TikTok on your phone currently, it can track your whereabouts. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=115.48s)]
*  It can read your text messages. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=120.4s)]
*  It can track your keystrokes. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  It has access to your phone records. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=123.04s)]
*  And the problem with that is all of that information is available to and subject to inspection by the government Beijing. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  And that's a massive it's not just a national security threat. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=132.88s)]
*  It's a personal security threat. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=136.36s)]
*  So whatever you think of TikTok, you love it, you hate it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=137.76s)]
*  The issue with it is its national security problems. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=141.72s)]
*  If it were sold, that'd be no problem. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=143.92s)]
*  The Supreme Court has rightly decided to uphold the requirement that TikTok be sold. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=145.68s)]
*  I support an extension of time, which can be done by the president based on efforts to sell TikTok. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=152.56s)]
*  TikTok should not be banned. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=162.16s)]
*  It should be sold. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=163.68s)]
*  China should not own it, but it should continue to exist in this country. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=165.48s)]
*  The Supreme Court's decision opens the way for constructive efforts now to preserve TikTok, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=170.2s)]
*  which everybody wants, but not under Chinese ownership, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=177.72s)]
*  enabling that enemy of the United States to surveil, collect information and present a threat to our national security. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=182.76s)]
*  I think it's a terrible idea to ban them from using it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=191.04s)]
*  And essentially it is a ban. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=193.76s)]
*  They say, oh, it's not a ban. It's just a restriction. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=195.04s)]
*  No, if you have like a company worth $100 billion and you say you got two days to sell your company or even six months, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=197.6s)]
*  or then you threaten them with other things, oh, well, we'll say it's antitrust if Facebook wants to buy it, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=203.24s)]
*  or somebody else, there's nothing to do with people with $100 billion sitting around. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=208.24s)]
*  It's a terrible idea to do this. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=212.4s)]
*  It's a terrible precedent to say we're going to shut down on speech. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=214.0s)]
*  Some people say, oh, well, China bans apps. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=218.32s)]
*  Yeah, they're an authoritarian country. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=220.96s)]
*  That's why we're not China. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  We should not be banning speech. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=224.12s)]
*  Terrible decision. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=225.8s)]
*  So CBS News crews taking the temperature of senators. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=227.44s)]
*  There are certainly more senators to talk to. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=230.32s)]
*  But again, really, it all comes down to Donald Trump and all eyes are on him. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=232.28s)]
*  What will he do? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=235.84s)]
*  We're getting some clues on his social media platform today. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  He says right here, the Supreme Court decision was expected and everyone must respect it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=239.56s)]
*  My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=245.16s)]
*  But the president let goes on to say I must have time to review the situation. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=248.96s)]
*  So stay tuned. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=252.88s)]
*  So let's continue the conversation and bring in CBS News Supreme Court reporter Catherine [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=254.36s)]
*  Cole. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=258.04s)]
*  Catherine, good to have you with us. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=259.04s)]
*  Break this down for us. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=260.04s)]
*  No dissenting opinion. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  So what do you make of those remarks by Justice Gorsuch? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=262.68s)]
*  Yeah, no dissenting opinion. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=266.48s)]
*  This is a resounding 9-0 defeat for TikTok and a decisive victory for the government, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=269.68s)]
*  which argued that the national security concerns identified by Congress were sufficient for [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=275.64s)]
*  the to impose this burden on TikTok. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=280.88s)]
*  TikTok tried to make a First Amendment argument and the court, speaking with one voice here [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=283.96000000000004s)]
*  and an opinion without any author, sort of emphasizing that the court is unanimous here, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=288.44s)]
*  said those First Amendment problems, we don't see them. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=293.32s)]
*  I think you're right to note Justice Gorsuch's opinion. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=297.08000000000004s)]
*  So he says I agree with the bottom line. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=299.6s)]
*  I'm on board. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=301.6s)]
*  I just have a few additional thoughts of my own. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=302.6s)]
*  And what I really pick up from him, he was maybe the most pro-free speech voice at oral [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  argument last week. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=310.56s)]
*  I think he's saying even considering my real hesitation to potentially step on free speech [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=312.04s)]
*  concerns, this law still passes constitutional muster. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=318.16s)]
*  And he emphasizes, of course, this has been an incredibly expedited review process, right? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=322.24s)]
*  Because of that January 19th deadline, this case came to the court quickly. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=327.36s)]
*  Briefing was quickly. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=331.24s)]
*  Oral argument was last week in the decisions today. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=332.24s)]
*  He's saying we didn't have a lot of time to look at it and I'm concerned about free speech. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=335.76s)]
*  But even there, on top of all of those things, I still think that this law is fine. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=340.24s)]
*  Well, in recent hours, President Joe Biden signalling he's not going to enforce or implement [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=345.12s)]
*  this ban, he's essentially kicking it over to the president-elect. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=349.68s)]
*  And it really bears mentioning that going into the inauguration, sitting close to the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=352.68s)]
*  president-elect is one of TikTok's top bosses. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=357.36s)]
*  Donald Trump has said he warmed to TikTok. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=361.12s)]
*  So what are his options there and how could that shape the future of the app? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, the ball is in President Trump's court at this point in time. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=368.23999999999995s)]
*  So you can see why the TikTok CEO has been getting closer to him more recently. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  Here's how this is going to work on Sunday. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=377.15999999999997s)]
*  The enforcement mechanism of this law really acts on the service providers, the app stores, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=379.32s)]
*  the tech companies that work as the intermediary between you, the TikTok user, and TikTok itself. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=385.35999999999996s)]
*  And if they essentially enable your access to TikTok, they face potential, quite serious [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=391.65999999999997s)]
*  financial penalties. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=396.9s)]
*  And so what Biden is saying is we're not going to enforce that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=398.26s)]
*  What President Trump could do is say as a matter of my administration's policy, we're [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=401.26s)]
*  also not going to enforce that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=405.53999999999996s)]
*  That's one path. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=407.46s)]
*  See if that works. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=408.53999999999996s)]
*  He could also try and lean on Congress to get this law repealed, although I don't think [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=409.85999999999996s)]
*  there's appetite on the Hill for that. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=413.41999999999996s)]
*  Or he could try and he's hinted at an executive order. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=415.5s)]
*  It's unclear what that would look like, some sort of quasi-legislative attempt to assert [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=418.82s)]
*  his own power here. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=424.92s)]
*  That would probably set the stage for future legal challenges. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=427.92s)]
*  It would depend on the details there, which of course are unknown. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=430.04s)]
*  As President Trump himself said, he needs time to review the situation. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=432.96s)]
*  So it could be a minute before we find out. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=436.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=437.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=438.6s)]
*  And he says he needs the time to reassess the situation. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=439.6s)]
*  But you know, he is famously self-sold in the American public as a dealmaker, as a businessman. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=440.6s)]
*  So it'll be very fascinating to see what moves he makes that will be that pro-business mandate [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=445.92s)]
*  that he sold to voters on the campaign trail. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=451.71999999999997s)]
*  I also have another question. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  So does what happened today with the Supreme Court really open the door for Congress to [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=456.16s)]
*  ban other social media platforms that may be run or have a hand in governments that [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=459.06s)]
*  are seen adverse to the objectives of the United States? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=464.38s)]
*  Yeah, I think the Supreme Court is very wary of not doing that. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=467.44s)]
*  And I'm looking at this first line, I've got the opinion right in front of me that says, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=472.84000000000003s)]
*  we are conscious that this case involves new technologies and that this challenging new [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=476.64s)]
*  context, it counsels caution on our part. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=482.20000000000005s)]
*  What they're saying is this is narrow. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=484.52000000000004s)]
*  We're not going to open the door for broad social media bans, First Amendment violations. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=486.48s)]
*  This is this app, this law, this context, this weekend. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=492.98s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=498.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=499.0s)]
*  Well, thank you so much for the conversation. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=500.0s)]
*  It is fascinating when you see the Supreme Court vote unanimously on anything that in [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  and of itself is newsmaking. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6evAtLZU6kE&t=506.76000000000005s)]
