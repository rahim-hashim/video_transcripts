# Latest weather forecast as landslide, toxic chemical concerns grow
**CBS News:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg)
*  So let's take the focus now back to Southern California. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=0.0s)]
*  We continue to see this devastation playing out [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=3.38s)]
*  and the work to put out those hotspots. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=5.76s)]
*  So let's talk about the firefighters. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=7.96s)]
*  In Southern California, they have the weekend [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=9.88s)]
*  to really try to boost those containment numbers [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=11.92s)]
*  as they do expect some of those harsh winds [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=14.32s)]
*  entering LA County to die down. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=16.72s)]
*  But get this, 80,000 people are out of their homes [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=19.2s)]
*  and now they're hearing of a new warning, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=23.52s)]
*  landslides and toxic chemicals, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=25.82s)]
*  and that only adds to the risks. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=28.04s)]
*  CBS News reporter Andres Gutierrez in Pacific Palisades, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=30.12s)]
*  he is live there outside of one of those burned out homes. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=33.4s)]
*  You know, my friend, if I am one of those homeowners, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=36.2s)]
*  I wanna get in, I wanna sift through and see what remains. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=38.32s)]
*  I wanna maybe even start hauling some things away. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=41.34s)]
*  You're saying that they can't get in [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=44.46s)]
*  and really touch anything in a formative way? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=45.96s)]
*  Correct, at this point, the county has said [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=51.96s)]
*  that they have to have professionals come in [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=54.260000000000005s)]
*  and assess the situation, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=57.12s)]
*  what kind of hazardous materials burned, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=58.64s)]
*  how are they gonna remove it? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  In some cases, as I pointed out earlier, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=62.64s)]
*  there are some electric vehicles [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=64.8s)]
*  that are sitting in the garages, in the parking lots there [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=66.08s)]
*  that have to have those lithium ion batteries [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=70.32s)]
*  that have the risk of catching fire, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=73.2s)]
*  even though the fire is out. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=75.56s)]
*  It's also emitting toxic chemicals, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=77.6s)]
*  and so they're looking at other best practices [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=80.72s)]
*  from previous disasters, like the one in Hawaii and Maui [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=83.16s)]
*  in 2023 to see how they dispose of those [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=86.44s)]
*  and how they could apply that to here. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=90.16s)]
*  In the last 10 minutes, we received an alert [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=92.16s)]
*  from the mayor's office that at two o'clock our time here [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=94.56s)]
*  locally at five o'clock Eastern, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=98.12s)]
*  she will be making a major announcement [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=100.04s)]
*  in the rebuilding process, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=102.06s)]
*  so we're gonna monitor that as well. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=103.28s)]
*  Right now, here in the heart of the disaster, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  there are public works crews that are trying to make repairs [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  to those lines that were damaged during the fire. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=110.98s)]
*  EPA crews also going to lots like this, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=114.68s)]
*  trying to make those assessment [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=118.04s)]
*  of those hazardous materials. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=119.52s)]
*  The LA Sheriff's Department has also issued a warning [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=121.92s)]
*  to all the deputies, the ones working over [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=125.68s)]
*  in the Altadena area to make sure [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=128.28s)]
*  that they are wearing their N95 masks [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=130.06s)]
*  because they're saying that the air is hazardous. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=132.56s)]
*  It can contain lead and asbestos, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=135.4s)]
*  and they're also asking those deputies to make sure [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=137.48s)]
*  that they decontaminate, wash their uniforms [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=140.6s)]
*  before they head home. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=145.04s)]
*  So a lot of safeguards being taken in place here [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=146.38s)]
*  because of all the risks that are in the environment now [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=149.18s)]
*  because of these wildfires. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=152.44s)]
*  And Andres, looking at that burned out house behind you, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=154.2s)]
*  it's so easy to forget that that is somebody's home there, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=157.0s)]
*  what remains of somebody's home, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=159.84s)]
*  and that the family that belonged to that house [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=161.38s)]
*  and those now ruins is looking for a place to stay. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=164.4s)]
*  There's also a big conversation happening [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=168.0s)]
*  in the state of California led by Rob Bonta, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=170.08s)]
*  the attorney general there about price gouging [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=173.24s)]
*  and the fact that they are tracking in real time, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=175.4s)]
*  people who would jack up the price of rent [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  or the price of short-term stays. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=180.04000000000002s)]
*  What do you know about that? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so before these disasters occurred, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=186.44s)]
*  the housing market here in LA, as you know, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=190.4s)]
*  was pretty tight. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=192.32000000000002s)]
*  And so now these folks are getting out there, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  they're trying to find a short-term rental. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=195.96s)]
*  A lot of these landlords have unfortunately [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=198.4s)]
*  been taking advantage of the situation. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  And we have seen on social media, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  people have been posting, you know, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=205.44000000000003s)]
*  screenshots of Zillow postings that have shot up 67%. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=206.68s)]
*  That is against state law. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=210.4s)]
*  The attorney general for the state of California [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  coming out and saying that they cannot do that. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=214.72000000000003s)]
*  When there's an emergence like this, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  prices cannot go up more than 10%. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=218.96s)]
*  His office has opened investigations [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=221.96s)]
*  into these allegations of price gouging. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=224.76000000000002s)]
*  They are encouraging folks who are experiencing this [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=227.48s)]
*  or seeing price gouging to take screenshots [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=231.04s)]
*  and email them or give them a call. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=234.2s)]
*  There is a specific hotline, I'll give you that hotline. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=236.12s)]
*  If you wanna take it down, it is 800-952-5225. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=239.12s)]
*  Again, 800-952-5225. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  There are the punishments. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=249.28s)]
*  If you are caught and if they do this investigation [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=250.64s)]
*  and they carry it out, the penalties can up to be [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=253.39999999999998s)]
*  a year in jail or up to a $10,000 fine. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=257.24s)]
*  And so the attorney general here in California [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=261.4s)]
*  taking this very seriously. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=263.76s)]
*  All right, Andres Gutierrez, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=265.46s)]
*  thank you so much for that update. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=266.6s)]
*  And let's talk to Jess right now [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=268.46s)]
*  because we understand there's a little window [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=270.04s)]
*  of opportunity before Monday [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=271.88s)]
*  when the winds are supposed to kick back up again. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=273.52s)]
*  You know, let's talk about that real fast. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=275.28s)]
*  We're gonna start seeing more Santa Ana winds [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=277.12s)]
*  as we head into Monday and Tuesday, yes. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=278.88s)]
*  But they're not gonna be nearly as strong [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=280.92s)]
*  as what we experienced last week or earlier this week. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=282.68s)]
*  Yes, it's just the same direction [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=285.28s)]
*  because right now what we're getting [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=287.4s)]
*  is that nice Pacific breeze [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=288.24s)]
*  along the California coastline that they're used to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  that helps relative humidity increase. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=291.2s)]
*  It's coming in from the Pacific, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  so it's a little bit cooler too. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=294.52s)]
*  It's gonna look different as we head into early next week. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=296.47999999999996s)]
*  And so that's that window that we were kinda just mentioning. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=298.47999999999996s)]
*  They're gonna get those offshore winds once again [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=300.68s)]
*  for Monday and Tuesday, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=302.56s)]
*  but right now it looks a lot different. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=303.44s)]
*  We dive all the way down into Southern California. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=305.3s)]
*  The Palisades fire along the coast near Malibu. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=307.52s)]
*  The Eaton fire all the way up near Pasadena. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=309.88s)]
*  And of course, all throughout Elstina, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=312.32s)]
*  we continue to keep a close eye on the containment [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=314.18s)]
*  of those fires and also the weather conditions too. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=317.48s)]
*  That was such the driving force [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=319.92s)]
*  when it came to watching these blow up in size. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=321.48s)]
*  And now what's happening right now, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=324.0s)]
*  winds are significantly light. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=325.24s)]
*  I mean, at gusts, we're seeing close to around [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  three mile per hour winds pushing in from the Pacific [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=329.32s)]
*  and heading into the next couple hours. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=332.32s)]
*  We'll continue to really watch [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=334.06s)]
*  these light conditions stick around. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=335.24s)]
*  That's the case for us as we head all the way [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=337.76s)]
*  into our Monday forecast, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=339.56s)]
*  except for the fact that we start to see them [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=340.64s)]
*  kick up just a little bit more. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=342.32s)]
*  At max, close to around 20 mile per hour wind gusts [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=343.72s)]
*  as we head into our Monday forecast. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=346.84s)]
*  By Tuesday, we'll continue to see that kind of die down. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=348.03999999999996s)]
*  But that shift of winds, of course, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=350.88s)]
*  still causes a concern when it comes [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=352.59999999999997s)]
*  to lower relative humidity. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=354.4s)]
*  It's high right now. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=355.52s)]
*  It's starting to decrease as we head into early next week [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=356.74s)]
*  in those forecasted models. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=359.08s)]
*  So like I said, these winds that we're talking about, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=360.28s)]
*  you know, you don't want to strike fear for them, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=363.08s)]
*  but you do want them to know what they can expect [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=364.44s)]
*  as we head into this weekend. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=366.48s)]
*  It is gonna be lighter this weekend. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=368.08s)]
*  By Monday and Tuesday, they'll start getting [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=369.52s)]
*  those offshore winds, which makes it a little bit [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=370.84s)]
*  challenging for the firefighters out there [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=373.08s)]
*  battling these fires. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=375.3s)]
*  Okay, and Mother Nature is also dominating headlines [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=376.3s)]
*  over in Washington, D.C. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=378.58s)]
*  because it's going to be frigid for the inauguration. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgwdHnLDmtg&t=379.9s)]
