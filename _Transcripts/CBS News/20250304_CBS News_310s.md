# Johnson says GOP lawmakers shouldn't hold in-person town halls
**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4)
*  Welcome back. House Republican leaders is encouraging Republican members of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=0.0s)]
*  conference to think twice before holding more in-person town hall meetings. That [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=5.68s)]
*  because constituents, including some Democrats, have been protesting something [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=11.0s)]
*  that's gonna come up in the president's speech tonight. Elon Musk and Department [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=16.36s)]
*  of Government efficiency cuts to the federal workforce. Speaker Mike Johnson [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=20.56s)]
*  was asked about that today. The best thing that our members can do is [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=24.32s)]
*  communicate directly, frequently, consistently with their constituents and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=28.42s)]
*  their other avenues to do it than just going in to try to give the other side [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=32.06s)]
*  sound bites. I mean they're doing this for the cameras, we all know it, and I [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=35.82s)]
*  think it's wise not to play into it right now. Maryland Republican Congressman [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=39.260000000000005s)]
*  Andy Harris joins me now. He is the chair of the House Freedom Congress. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=43.620000000000005s)]
*  Congressman, is that good advice from the speaker about to do these in-person [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=46.82000000000001s)]
*  town halls? Well I think it's great advice because we need to reach out to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=51.18000000000001s)]
*  many more people than you can put in a town hall. You know those are dozens or [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=55.9s)]
*  maybe a couple hundred. When I do my telephone town halls we reach thousands. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=59.42s)]
*  You know that's the goal, reach as many as you can. And the theatrics at some of [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=63.54s)]
*  these town halls, again George Soros funded theatrics, are you know they're [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=67.66s)]
*  over the top. They distract from communicating to the average person. Does [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=71.8s)]
*  it in any way make it look as if Republicans are afraid at any level to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=76.3s)]
*  engage in this debate with those who are unhappy at their town halls? Well only [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=80.54s)]
*  if you don't ask the Republicans how many thousands they've reached on [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=86.46000000000001s)]
*  telephone town halls. The fact of the matter is that's the technology we [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=89.66000000000001s)]
*  should be using now. We should be reaching out to as many people as [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=93.18s)]
*  possible, not to an isolated few in a town hall. You're gonna meet with the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=95.98s)]
*  president, that is to say yourself, and the Freedom Caucus at the White House [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=100.86000000000001s)]
*  tomorrow. What's on the agenda and what is the Freedom Caucus's current point of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=104.42s)]
*  view on a continuing resolution to avoid a government shutdown? Well we of [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=108.78s)]
*  course helped deliver the votes on the budget resolution last week. I believe [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=114.94s)]
*  that we will help deliver the votes on the continuing resolution next week. The [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=118.7s)]
*  president has asked for a continuing resolution to the end of the fiscal year [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=122.1s)]
*  to advance his agenda and I think that we're gonna try to deliver it. In the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=125.62s)]
*  way that the speaker has currently described it, you don't have any [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=131.82s)]
*  objections to the speaker's approach on resolving the continuing resolution as [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=134.38s)]
*  essentially keeping Biden's spending levels throughout the remainder of the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=138.76s)]
*  fiscal year? No I don't have it at all because President Biden's not in the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  Oval Office and he's not actually deciding how the spending goes. The [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=147.48s)]
*  bottom line is the president through the executive action is deciding how that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=150.88s)]
*  goes. This will freeze spending at the current level. I think Americans don't [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  want to increase spending. They realize a two trillion dollar deficit is probably [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=158.76s)]
*  just about as high as we really should be going and I think they look forward [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=162.56s)]
*  to again the economies and the efficiencies of the Trump administration. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=166.36s)]
*  Do you believe, Congressman, that the tariffs imposed today on Canada and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=172.44000000000003s)]
*  Mexico will last for a long time or they are a short-term means by which to get [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=178.96s)]
*  to something else? I think that's right. I think what the president has said, he [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=185.36s)]
*  said he wants the borders controlled. He wants to stop the flow of fentanyl across [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=190.52s)]
*  both our southern border and our northern border and I think if we if [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=193.96s)]
*  Canada and Mexico take steps toward that I think those tariffs will be relieved. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=197.84s)]
*  I want to play for you some sound from President Trump. January 2020 celebrating [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=202.0s)]
*  the USMCA, the trade agreement that these tariffs violate. I want you to listen to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=208.08s)]
*  that please. USMCA is the largest, fairest, most balanced and modern trade agreement [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=213.28s)]
*  ever achieved. There's never been anything like it. Other countries are now [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=218.74s)]
*  looking at it but there can't be a border like that because believe it or [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=222.64s)]
*  not that is by far the biggest border anywhere in the world in terms of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=226.32s)]
*  economy, in terms of people. There's nothing even close. So Congressman, if in [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=230.0s)]
*  President's words it's the largest, fairest and most balanced trade agreement [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=235.11999999999998s)]
*  ever, why do we need tariffs? Well because Mexico basically was a [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=239.04s)]
*  co-conspirator with the Biden administration allowing 10 million people [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=244.27999999999997s)]
*  across our southern border unregulated, allowing unregulated fentanyl across [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=247.48s)]
*  our southern border. I think he thought that Canada and Mexico would keep up [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=251.6s)]
*  their part of that bargain. Well obviously they didn't. Hopefully they will [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=256.84s)]
*  in the future and again we can scale back those tariffs. Yes or no, do you have [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=260.08s)]
*  any fear that these tariffs if they are long-running will increase prices for [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=264.54s)]
*  your consumers in your district? Well that's a hypothetical question. I don't [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=269.96s)]
*  think they're going to be just like I just said. I don't think they're going to [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=275.04s)]
*  be long-running. I think they're going to achieve the goal of decreasing fentanyl [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=277.12s)]
*  crossing our borders. What's your definition of long-running? More than a [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=280.12s)]
*  couple months. Look I think we saw from Mexico's action two months ago that [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  they folded in about two days. I don't know how long this is going to take. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=289.96s)]
*  These countries will try to play the victim but in fact the victims are the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=294.04s)]
*  families who's the family who has members that died from fentanyl. They're [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=298.16s)]
*  the real victims here, not Canada and Mexico. Congressman Andy Harris, Maryland. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=302.52s)]
*  Thank you very much sir. Thank you. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bwU09564Y4&t=306.72s)]
