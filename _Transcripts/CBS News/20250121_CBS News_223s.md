# "Border czar" Tom Homan tells reporter that ICE officers were told to begin raids
**CBS News:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM)
*  Welcome back to CBS News 24-7. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=0.0s)]
*  We have some news that is developing at this hour. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=2.5s)]
*  Borders are Tom Holman telling journalists [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=5.0s)]
*  that immigration raids have indeed started [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=7.84s)]
*  in these United States as part of President Donald Trump's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=10.44s)]
*  crackdown on immigration. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=13.08s)]
*  So we want to go back to our legal analyst [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=14.48s)]
*  and trial attorney Robin Nunn. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=16.64s)]
*  Robin, that news just breaking over the last few minutes [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=18.04s)]
*  from Mr. Holman. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=20.88s)]
*  So we don't know exactly where those raids are taking place. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=22.22s)]
*  All eyes have been on Chicago, but this really opens up [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=24.88s)]
*  the question about whether this is legal [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=28.32s)]
*  and whether there will be legal challenges [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=31.62s)]
*  or if federal agents can just go in and get it done. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, immigration policy is obviously often set [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=37.58s)]
*  by the president. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=40.72s)]
*  He definitely has the authority. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=41.82s)]
*  Raids have been being done for years. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=43.46s)]
*  What is happening right now is, I think, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=45.7s)]
*  really being called into question. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=48.84s)]
*  I don't think we know enough information at this point, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=50.64s)]
*  but I think that information will be coming. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  Typically, after these types of broad raids, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=54.900000000000006s)]
*  there is a lot of litigation. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=58.44s)]
*  There's a lot of class actions involving [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=59.8s)]
*  the illegal detainment of people that were never supposed [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=61.94s)]
*  to be caught up in these raids. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=65.18s)]
*  So I expect that this is going to be quite a legal fight. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=66.38s)]
*  Well, Chicago's mayor was on the radio this morning [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=69.84s)]
*  saying that local law enforcement will not participate, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=72.32s)]
*  but they also will not intervene. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=74.88s)]
*  So it'll be fascinating to see how that plays out [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=76.56s)]
*  when you look at federal agents as opposed to local police. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=79.06s)]
*  But to your point, we're already seeing some legal challenges [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=82.0s)]
*  to some of President Trump's executive orders. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=84.46000000000001s)]
*  We're understanding 18 democratic states [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  have now filed federal lawsuits to stop [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=89.08s)]
*  the administration's effort [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=91.16s)]
*  on eliminating birthright citizenship. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  So how does this work its way through the courts? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=95.22s)]
*  What's the process? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=97.41999999999999s)]
*  Do you get a sense that the president is banking [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=98.66s)]
*  that this will go all the way up to the Supreme Court [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=100.86s)]
*  that he arguably feels pretty confident in? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=103.3s)]
*  Yeah, I think this is gonna be a huge legal showdown. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=106.13999999999999s)]
*  I think we're seeing 18 states, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=109.1s)]
*  as well as the city of San Francisco, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=110.78s)]
*  city of Washington, D.C. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=113.5s)]
*  I think this is something that is unprecedented. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=115.16s)]
*  The Supreme Court has previously held [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=117.74s)]
*  that birthright citizenship is something that, you know, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=119.5s)]
*  most people is protected and most people expect. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=122.2s)]
*  I think that this is going to be something [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=125.98s)]
*  that is going to be a major showdown [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=127.64s)]
*  for the Supreme Court, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=129.52s)]
*  where we're really gonna take a look [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=130.72s)]
*  at Trump's second term agenda, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=132.32s)]
*  and this is gonna be on the top of the list. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=134.32s)]
*  Well, and for our viewers who are just logging on, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=136.18s)]
*  maybe in the palm of your own hand, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=138.46s)]
*  we are getting early reports that raids have started. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=139.86s)]
*  Just one day after that executive order, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=143.68s)]
*  those mass deportation promises being delivered on [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=145.68s)]
*  by Donald Trump that he made on the campaign trail, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=148.32s)]
*  I wanna shift a little bit in the conversation, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=151.32s)]
*  and I wanna ask you about those January 6th insurrection, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=154.16s)]
*  as many of them pled guilty. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=157.4s)]
*  And my question is about precedent, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=159.44s)]
*  because if, with the stroke of a pen, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=162.2s)]
*  people who have pled guilty themselves, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=164.0s)]
*  have been sentenced, who are serving time, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=166.14s)]
*  if all of that can just be wiped out, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=168.44s)]
*  how does this inform legal cases [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  that are sure to come up in the future going forward? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=171.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think that the president's pardon powers [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=175.6s)]
*  are pretty typical. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=180.0s)]
*  Most modern presidents use them at some point in time, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=181.4s)]
*  and this was something that was expected. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=185.2s)]
*  While this was expected, this is quite broad. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=188.4s)]
*  Obviously, this includes both violent [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=192.64s)]
*  and nonviolent offenders, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=195.1s)]
*  people who have not yet even been convicted yet, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=197.12s)]
*  people who are currently in prison, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=199.52s)]
*  people who have obviously admitted that they were guilty. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=200.85999999999999s)]
*  So it is pretty far-reaching, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=203.06s)]
*  but presidents always often have pardon power, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=205.22s)]
*  and this is just President Trump using it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=208.42s)]
*  All right, legal analyst and trial attorney Robin Nunn, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=210.94s)]
*  we thank you for jumping back on [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=213.32s)]
*  as we got that news of raids beginning [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=214.7s)]
*  in these United States, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=217.42s)]
*  and certainly we're working to find out [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=218.64s)]
*  exactly where they are. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=219.85999999999999s)]
*  But thank you for the conversation. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMtcMduHdM&t=221.42s)]
