# Sen. Duckworth asks Hegseth about budget audits: "What are you afraid of?"
**CBS News:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I)
*  Senator Duckworth, you are recognized. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and also Secretary Mattis [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=2.32s)]
*  had to have this waiver as well. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Mr. Hecks, this hearing is about whether you are qualified [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=8.2s)]
*  to be Secretary of Defense. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=11.4s)]
*  And one of the qualifications to answer my colleague's question [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=12.64s)]
*  is to actually win the votes of every member of this committee [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=15.56s)]
*  and to be confirmed by the United States Senate. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=18.96s)]
*  And you need to convince us that you're worthy of that vote, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=21.12s)]
*  because the people of the state of Illinois [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=23.96s)]
*  voted for me to be their senator so that I could cast that vote [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=25.76s)]
*  when it comes to picking who is going to be [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=29.08s)]
*  the next Secretary of Defense. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  This hearing now seems to be a hearing about whether or not [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=33.28s)]
*  women are qualified to serve in combat [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=35.56s)]
*  and not about whether or not you are qualified [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=38.6s)]
*  to be Secretary of Defense. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=40.8s)]
*  And let me just say that the American people need a sec [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=42.44s)]
*  def who's ready to lead on day one. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=44.54s)]
*  You are not that person. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  Our adversaries watched closely during times of transition [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=48.4s)]
*  and any sense that the Department of Defense [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=51.84s)]
*  that keeps us safe is being steered by someone [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  who is wholly unprepared for the job [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=55.92s)]
*  puts America at risk. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=57.64s)]
*  And I am not willing to do that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=59.24s)]
*  With that in mind, Mr. Hextheth, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=61.8s)]
*  I want you to try to explain to the American people, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=63.08s)]
*  this committee who have to vote for you [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=65.32s)]
*  and to our troops who are deployed around the world, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=68.64s)]
*  why you are qualified to lead the Department of Defense. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=70.4s)]
*  We already know that you've only led [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=73.44s)]
*  on the largest 200 person organization. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=74.84s)]
*  We already know that you so badly mangled a budget [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=77.88s)]
*  that after you left, they had to bring in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=81.56s)]
*  a forensic accountant to figure out what went wrong. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=83.52s)]
*  The largest budget you ever managed was about $18 billion. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=87.72s)]
*  That is about 51,560 times lower [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=91.72s)]
*  than the Department of Defense budget of $825 billion. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=97.56s)]
*  $16 million is 51,568 times smaller than the Defense budget. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=101.86s)]
*  Please describe to me, Mr. Hextheth, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=109.42s)]
*  you talk about DOD passing an audit. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=110.92s)]
*  Please describe to me a time or an organization [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=113.46s)]
*  that you led underwent an audit. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=118.38s)]
*  Because you say you're gonna hire smarter people [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=121.25999999999999s)]
*  than you to run this audit. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=123.14s)]
*  I'm not asking you to be an accountant. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=124.97999999999999s)]
*  I want you to be able to tell me what kind of guidance [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=126.69999999999999s)]
*  will be given to those employees, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=129.9s)]
*  what will happen whether or not you pass that audit. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=131.54s)]
*  Have you led an audit of any organization, yes or no? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=135.01999999999998s)]
*  I don't want a long answer, yes or no, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=138.22s)]
*  have you led an audit of any organization [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=139.5s)]
*  of which you were in charge? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=141.74s)]
*  Senator, in both of the organizations I ran, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=143.74s)]
*  we were always completely fiscally responsible [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=145.5s)]
*  for the money that we had. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=148.42000000000002s)]
*  Yes or no, did you lead an audit? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=149.26s)]
*  And the way my leadership has been stated [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=150.08s)]
*  has been completely mischaracterized. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=152.42000000000002s)]
*  What are you afraid of? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=153.26s)]
*  You can't answer this question. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=154.1s)]
*  Yes or no, did you lead an audit? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=155.5s)]
*  Do you not know this answer? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=157.46s)]
*  Senator, every part of my leadership [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=159.1s)]
*  of these organizations has been misrepresented [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=160.9s)]
*  from top to bottom. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=163.26s)]
*  I will take that as a no. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=164.1s)]
*  What were the findings? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=164.94s)]
*  Though there were no findings, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=165.76s)]
*  you've never led an audit. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=166.6s)]
*  What guidance did you give the auditors? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=167.58s)]
*  None, because you've never led an audit. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=170.06s)]
*  Nobody expects you to be an accountant, Mr. Hekstaff. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=172.18s)]
*  We expect this for you to understand the complexity [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=174.9s)]
*  of this Pentagon budget process [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=177.62s)]
*  that is absolutely necessary to outfit our war fighters. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=179.14000000000001s)]
*  Look, the Secret Defense is required [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=183.02s)]
*  to make quick decisions every single day [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=185.1s)]
*  that with high level information is being provided for them. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=188.42000000000002s)]
*  A Secret Defense has to have breadth and depth of knowledge. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=191.74s)]
*  Right now, I am concerned that you have neither. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=194.78s)]
*  Mr. Hekstaff, what is the highest level [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=197.3s)]
*  of international negotiations that you have engaged in, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=200.14s)]
*  that you have led in, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=202.66s)]
*  because the Secret Defense does lead [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=203.5s)]
*  international security negotiations. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=204.9s)]
*  There are three main ones [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=207.34s)]
*  that the Secret Defense leads and signs. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=208.29999999999998s)]
*  Can you name at least one of them? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=210.48s)]
*  Could you repeat the question, Senator? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=212.78s)]
*  Sure, what is the highest level [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=214.42s)]
*  of international security agreement that you have led? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=215.98s)]
*  And can you name some that the Secret Defense would lead? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=220.29999999999998s)]
*  There are three main ones. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=223.57999999999998s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=225.42s)]
*  I have not been involved [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=226.26s)]
*  in international security arrangements [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=227.1s)]
*  because I have not been in government [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=228.76s)]
*  other than serving in the military. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=230.39999999999998s)]
*  So my job has been to lead men and women in combat. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=231.84s)]
*  Can you name one of the three main ones [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  that the Secret Defense signs? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=236.2s)]
*  You're talking about defense arrangements. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=237.04s)]
*  I mean, NATO might be one that you're referring to. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=237.88s)]
*  Status of Forces Agreement would be one of them. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=241.2s)]
*  Status of Forces Agreement. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=243.56s)]
*  I've been a part of teaching [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=245.07999999999998s)]
*  about Status of Forces Agreement [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=246.84s)]
*  inside Afghanistan. But you don't remember [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=248.39999999999998s)]
*  to mention it? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=249.23999999999998s)]
*  You're not qualified, Mr. Hekstaff. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=251.16s)]
*  You're not qualified. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=253.56s)]
*  You talk about repairing our defense industrial complex. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=254.39999999999998s)]
*  You're not qualified to that. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=257.52s)]
*  You could do acquisition and cross-servicing agreements, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  which essentially are security agreements. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=260.91999999999996s)]
*  You can't even mention that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  You've done none of those. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=264.06s)]
*  You talked about the Indo-Pacific a little bit, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  and I'm glad that you mentioned it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=267.4s)]
*  Can you name the importance of at least one of the nations [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=269.4s)]
*  in the ASEAN and what type of agreement we have [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=273.08s)]
*  with at least one of those nations? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=277.2s)]
*  And how many nations are in ASEAN, by the way? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=278.79999999999995s)]
*  I couldn't tell you the exact amount of nations in that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=281.76s)]
*  But I know we have allies in South Korea, in Japan, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  and in AUKUS with Australia, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  and trying to work on submarines with them. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  And data transfers with them. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=291.44s)]
*  Mr. Hekstaff, none of those countries are in ASEAN. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=292.28s)]
*  None of those three countries that you've mentioned [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=294.59999999999997s)]
*  are in ASEAN. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=296.64s)]
*  I suggest you do a little homework [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=297.47999999999996s)]
*  before you prepare for these types of negotiations. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  Listen. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=302.35999999999996s)]
*  Mr. Hekstaff, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=305.11999999999995s)]
*  we ask our troops to go into harm's way all the time. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=309.28s)]
*  We ask them to go into harm's way. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=313.28s)]
*  And this behind me is a copy of the Soldier's Creed, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=315.28s)]
*  a copy that usually hangs over my desk here in the Senate. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  And you should be familiar with it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  It's the same copy that hung over my desk at Walter Reed [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=322.35999999999996s)]
*  every single day that I woke up and fought my way back [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=325.4s)]
*  because I wanted to go back and serve next to my buddies [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=328.67999999999995s)]
*  who saved my life. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=330.91999999999996s)]
*  These same, the same copy, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=332.2s)]
*  these words are repeated over and over and over again. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=334.96s)]
*  And let me read out two things to you, two sentences. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=338.32s)]
*  I will always place the mission first, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=341.91999999999996s)]
*  and I am disciplined physically and mentally tough, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  trained and proficient in my warrior task. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  Mr. Hekstaff, our troops follow these words every single day [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=350.2s)]
*  and they man up and they pack their rucksacks [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=353.68s)]
*  and they go to war. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  And they deserve a leader who can lead them, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=357.2s)]
*  not a leader who wants to lower the standards for himself [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=359.6s)]
*  or raising the standards for other people. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=363.16s)]
*  And by the way, our troops already meet the standards. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=365.56s)]
*  We ask troops to man that ship, fight that fire, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=368.48s)]
*  fly that helicopter until their very last breath. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=371.44s)]
*  And they do that every single day. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=374.84s)]
*  They cannot be led by someone [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=377.52s)]
*  who's not competent to do the job. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=379.28s)]
*  How can we ask these warriors to train [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=381.23999999999995s)]
*  and perform the absolute highest standards [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=383.0s)]
*  when you are asking us to lower the standards [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=384.76s)]
*  to make you the Secretary of Defense [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=387.34s)]
*  simply because you are buddies with our president-elect? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=389.08s)]
*  And by the way, he has filed for bankruptcy six times. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=392.0s)]
*  I'm not quite sure he's the kind of CEO [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=395.12s)]
*  you want to refer to as a successful businessman. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=396.84s)]
*  Let me make it clear. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=399.79999999999995s)]
*  You can't seem to grasp that there is no U.S. military [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=402.4s)]
*  as we know it without the incredible women that we serve. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=405.44s)]
*  Women who've earned their place in their units, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=409.96s)]
*  you have not earned your place as Secretary of Defense. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=412.35999999999996s)]
*  You say you care about keeping our armed forces strong [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=414.44s)]
*  and that you like that armed forces of meritocracy, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=417.32s)]
*  then let's not lower the standards for you. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=421.4s)]
*  You, sir, are a no-go at this station. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvPirH1S1I&t=422.96s)]
