# Pilot's take on D.C. plane crash, flying into nation's capital
**CBS News:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAofupEkR4U)
*  Welcome back. Let's get to that breaking news of that plane and helicopter crash near Washington, D. C. 60 passengers and four crew members were on board the American Airlines flight 53 42 from Wichita to Washington. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAofupEkR4U&t=0.0s)]
*  The Black Hawk helicopter was in the process of training a crew of three service members. Those crew members were experienced pilots were told CBS News also learned they were wearing night vision goggles during that flight. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAofupEkR4U&t=13.0s)]
*  At least 30 bodies so far have been recovered from the Potomac River by search and rescue teams. And as we mentioned earlier, officials believe there are no survivors from this crash. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAofupEkR4U&t=25.0s)]
*  Let's bring in commercial airline pilot Captain Laura Eitz-Settler. For more on all this, Laura, thank you for joining us. I want to get your initial reactions when you saw this collision. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAofupEkR4U&t=36.0s)]
*  Well, of course, it's devastating to see. So we have our thoughts and prayers going out to all of the family members and loved ones that were involved in this. The crew members, the passengers and everyone that's been affected by this. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAofupEkR4U&t=47.0s)]
*  Now, have you flown into Reagan National Airport? Are you familiar with what it's like to land a plane at that airport? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAofupEkR4U&t=61.0s)]
*  Yes, many times. It's very busy airspace. In this case, we have a lot of different types of aviation, military, airlines, corporate, and it's very sensitive airspace because of the location and of course the need to protect the capital in this case. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAofupEkR4U&t=68.0s)]
*  So we heard these 13 seconds between the air traffic control and the pilots, the pilot of that plane and those 13 seconds are really going to be a key piece of evidence on all this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAofupEkR4U&t=86.0s)]
*  Can you walk us through what it's like when you are landing a plane and when you're coming in to the tarmac there and what communication looks like between the pilot, air traffic control and potentially other aircraft? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAofupEkR4U&t=96.0s)]
*  Well, absolutely. I mean, the regional jet pilots would be at that altitude, very focused on the runway and also controlling their physically flying the aircraft at that point. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAofupEkR4U&t=109.0s)]
*  And they'll be they would be watching airspeed, altitude, rate of descent, things of that nature. The Black Hawk pilots in this case, especially with night vision goggles, your acuity can be much less as in night flying in general. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAofupEkR4U&t=120.0s)]
*  You don't have the same, you know, clarity of visual cues that you normally do, but especially with night vision goggles, that depth perception, you don't really have that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAofupEkR4U&t=136.0s)]
*  It's very flat. So with the closure rates and the similarity to the speeds, it would be hard to actually make out the regional jet, even though they did call it in sight. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAofupEkR4U&t=146.0s)]
*  Now, you said you've flown into Reagan National many times and you're familiar with the different types of aircraft that you have to deal with as you're taking off and landing into that airport. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAofupEkR4U&t=160.0s)]
*  Have you ever had any issues or potential close calls with any military aircraft or lack of communication? Any issues at all? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAofupEkR4U&t=169.0s)]
*  Well, I have 12 over 12,000 flight hours. So as a more veteran airline captain, you know, we see things over time. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAofupEkR4U&t=178.0s)]
*  But our job is, you know, we put our lives on the line every day and, you know, safety of our passengers is primary first and foremost. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAofupEkR4U&t=188.0s)]
*  So there, you know, yes, have I had some close calls? Yes. And we have TCAS systems on board, which is a great technology that we've had for, gosh, the past two decades. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAofupEkR4U&t=197.0s)]
*  And that might be something that the investigators look into requiring possibly these type of military aircraft to also have a terminal or a traffic collision avoidance system on board as well. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAofupEkR4U&t=209.0s)]
*  Captain Laura Settler, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAofupEkR4U&t=222.0s)]
