# South Korea's impeached president detained as fallout from martial law declaration continues
**CBS News:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w)
*  South Korea's impeached president, Yoon Suk-hyo, has become the country's first ever sitting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=0.0s)]
*  leader to be arrested. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  The massive law enforcement operation involved more than 3,000 police officers at the presidential [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=5.88s)]
*  compound. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=10.84s)]
*  Yoon is being investigated for criminal insurrection after his botched attempt to impose martial [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=11.84s)]
*  law at the end of last year. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=15.84s)]
*  Junah Moon with our partners at the BBC News has more from Seoul. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=17.56s)]
*  This is the first time in the country's constitutional history that a sitting president has been [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=20.94s)]
*  arrested. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=25.96s)]
*  Yoon is now at the Corruption Investigative Office, and the CIO began questioning him [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=27.52s)]
*  on charges of leading an insurrection. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=33.4s)]
*  However, Yoon is exercising his right to remain silent. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=36.36s)]
*  He did not respond to any of the questions during the morning session according to local [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=40.84s)]
*  media. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=46.04s)]
*  He may continue to remain silent throughout the investigation, as he previously stated [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=47.68s)]
*  that he agreed to the interrogation to prevent a violent escalation, not because the process [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=54.0s)]
*  is legitimate. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=61.68s)]
*  His legal team also insists that the CIO's arrest warrants are illegal and invalid. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=63.68s)]
*  So CIO can now hold Yoon for up to 48 hours or obtain a detention warrant within this [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  period to keep him. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=77.72s)]
*  If the court refuses to issue the warrant, Yoon will be released. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=80.16s)]
*  But in case that the detention warrant is issued, Yoon can be detained for up to 20 [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  days before being brought to the trial. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=91.0s)]
*  Though Yoon may be arrested, South Korea's political crisis is far from over. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phChVWP5w&t=95.16s)]
