# What to know about Trump plan to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports
**CBS News:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ)
*  When we start with this, President Trump is back at the White House after attending Super Bowl 59 last night [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=0.0s)]
*  and says that more new tariffs will be announced today. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=4.64s)]
*  This time, he's imposing tariffs on 25% of all steel and aluminum imports coming into the United States. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=7.12s)]
*  A new CBS News poll shows 53% of those polled approve of the job the president is doing in office so far. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=13.84s)]
*  When it comes to tariffs, those polled were in favor of the president imposing them against China, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=20.0s)]
*  but did not like that he's imposing them on Europe, Canada, and Mexico. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=24.68s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News White House reporter Aaron Navarro to talk more about this. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=29.159999999999997s)]
*  Aaron, how are our trading partners reacting to this announcement from the president? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=33.4s)]
*  Nothing immediately, but we already have seen Canada and Mexico show that they are willing to respond [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=39.08s)]
*  with threats of retaliatory tariffs when Trump brought this up earlier during his tenure. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=45.32s)]
*  They eventually, of course, found an agreement regarding immigration and kind of negotiated with him there [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=50.84s)]
*  for a temporary pause in those tariffs. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=55.4s)]
*  Specifically in Canada, we could see more this Friday when there is an economic summit in Toronto [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  where Justin Trudeau will meet with business and labor leaders. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=62.36s)]
*  Just noting on these tariffs, past presidents have had steel tariffs before, including George W. Bush, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=66.6s)]
*  but this could really impact home building and other industries here in the U.S., [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  so certainly something to watch. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=77.16s)]
*  Certainly, as you point out, Aaron, some of these tariffs were already in place [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=79.32s)]
*  under the previous Trump administration he imposed them. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=82.84s)]
*  President Biden didn't remove them. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=85.48s)]
*  So do we know if these tariffs are going to go on top of the existing ones or what? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, we know that this is broadly part of Trump's aggression when it comes to foreign policy [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=92.84s)]
*  and the economy, trying to send a message to China. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=99.08s)]
*  Of course, as you brought up in the poll, it's not something that's necessarily a priority [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=101.88s)]
*  for American voters. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=106.36s)]
*  The understanding is that this does go on top of those tariffs, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=107.48s)]
*  but we'll see once we get the details of that later today. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=110.04s)]
*  The other news is a federal judge in Boston who weighed in on whether the Trump administration [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=113.64s)]
*  can move forward with its plans to buy out thousands of federal employees. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=118.92s)]
*  There's another ruling expected. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=122.84s)]
*  What are the unions saying about this, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=124.68s)]
*  and what are we hearing from Trump administration officials? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=126.44s)]
*  The president of the American Federation of Government Employees said they are pleased [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=129.96s)]
*  with a temporary pause, so they continue to believe that this program violates the law. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=134.04000000000002s)]
*  They kind of view this as one of the many inflection points for Trump's efforts to revamp [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=138.44s)]
*  the federal workforce early in his second term. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=142.52s)]
*  The Trump administration and the Office of Personnel Management says that this [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=145.88000000000002s)]
*  deadline of 1159 p.m. tonight stands, and that's what they're telling federal government workers. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=150.52s)]
*  But certainly there's a lot of confusion, especially since there's 65,000 or more [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=156.60000000000002s)]
*  that have already accepted this buyout. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=161.88s)]
*  Questions about whether that will stand. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=163.56s)]
*  Hopefully they're looking at clarity from the judge's ruling later today. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  And finally, Aaron, as you know, the Trump administration ordered the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=170.04s)]
*  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to stop most of its work. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=172.44s)]
*  This is an organization that has protected millions of Americans from unsavory business [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=176.44s)]
*  practices, whether the credit card companies or the banks with excessive fees. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=181.4s)]
*  So why is this a target for the White House? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, this program was created under former President Obama's tenure as part of the Dodd-Frank [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=188.44s)]
*  Act. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the foil for Trump and many Republicans was crucial to its creation, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=193.16s)]
*  and it's been long criticized by conservatives as overreaching. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=198.68s)]
*  As you brought up some of what the agency does, they have oversight over banks, mortgage originators. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=201.88s)]
*  The general thought is that the functions of CFPB could be folded into the Department of Treasury [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=207.56s)]
*  per Trump officials. We'll wait to see if that actually takes place in the way that they want it [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=213.16s)]
*  to. We're already seeing some core challenges to this effort. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  Aaron, you may be too young to remember the old saying, a penny for your thoughts, but it sounds [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=222.52s)]
*  like even your thoughts are going to grow up in price. They're going to get more expensive. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=226.04s)]
*  What's going on with the pennies at the mint? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I do remember this being in the West Wing episode. Trump yesterday noted that it costs [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=233.48s)]
*  actually more to make the penny than what it's worth, but it is unclear if he does have the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  authority as it is up to Congress that authorizes the manufacturing of coins. It does cost, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=243.16s)]
*  according to the U.S. Mint, 3.69 cents to produce and distribute pennies. So certainly as Trump is [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=249.32s)]
*  trying to cut down government spending, the penny is one way he's looking at it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=255.24s)]
*  I guess we'll never realize the savings that we have when we see something that's only 99 cents. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=259.48s)]
*  Why not just make it a dollar? I mean, why not just make it a dollar, right Aaron? I think maybe [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=264.68s)]
*  that's what they're going for. Thank you, my friend. Appreciate it as always. Take care. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QveCwewiaQ&t=269.88s)]
