*  the 80 people on board in the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=24.92s)]
*  hospital right now with [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=25.52s)]
*  critical injuries. First [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=28.12s)]
*  of all, we're seeing a lot of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=29.36s)]
*  people on board. We're seeing [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=30.52s)]

*  over your social media feed, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=35.96s)]

*  and the drilling down for [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=41.0s)]

*  another plane crash in the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=43.24s)]
*  headlines? So once we hear from [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=46.04s)]
*  those officials at that podium, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  we're going to bring that to [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=48.28s)]
*  you live right here on CBS News [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=48.879999999999995s)]

*  correspondent Tom Hanson joins [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=52.84s)]
*  us live. Tom, what do we know [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=53.44s)]
*  about the crash? Well, we know [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=60.12s)]
*  that the passengers were going [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=60.76s)]
*  through one. Account from one [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=64.16s)]
*  passenger says that he felt [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=66.8s)]
*  like he was hanging like a bat [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=69.16s)]
*  before he unbuckled his seat [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=72.0s)]
*  belt and was able to get out of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=73.6s)]
*  the plane. These were just [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=75.0s)]
*  terrifying, shocking moments [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=77.4s)]
*  leading up to the rescue from [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=79.0s)]
*  the crew and additionally, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=81.24s)]
*  first responders who were [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=82.84s)]
*  standing by to get people out [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=84.44s)]
*  of the plane safely. As you saw [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=86.44s)]
*  earlier, the pilot was able to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=89.88s)]
*  get out of the plane very [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=91.68s)]
*  quickly upon landing. And so [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=93.48s)]
*  now the questions are [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=96.28s)]
*  circulating as to just what [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=98.36s)]
*  caused that was it was it a [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  mechanical failure? Was it [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=100.56s)]
*  weather conditions? We know [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=101.16s)]
*  that. There were wind gusts up [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=104.36s)]
*  to 37 miles an hour. That is [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=106.56s)]
*  not an easy landing for even [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=108.44s)]
*  the most experienced pilot. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=110.0s)]
*  Additionally, there were snowy [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=111.36s)]
*  conditions which could have [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  kicked snow up into the air, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=114.84s)]
*  really reduced the visibility [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=116.44s)]
*  of the plane. So we're hoping [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=118.52s)]
*  that the next few days, we're [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=119.92s)]
*  going to have a lot of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=121.56s)]
*  information from the police [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  departments from now for [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=125.0s)]
*  officials to give us some [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=126.8s)]
*  indication as to what they [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=128.6s)]
*  think went wrong where the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=130.16s)]
*  investigation is going and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=130.76s)]
*  what's next? Read such a scary, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=134.04s)]
*  scary experience for the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=135.44s)]
*  people who are on board, Tom. I [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  just have to ask. You know, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  usually when we do these [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=138.24s)]
*  stories, we say the NTSB or [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=138.84s)]
*  the National Transportation [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=139.28s)]
*  Safety Board is [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=139.68s)]
*  investigating. But. We are [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=142.28s)]
*  over international lines. Now [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=144.08s)]
*  it's Canada. Who's the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=145.28s)]
*  leader? Yeah, well, it's the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=146.64s)]
*  Canadian authorities that are [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=148.2s)]
*  taking the lead on this [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=149.6s)]
*  investigation. I know that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=150.6s)]
*  there might be some confusion [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=151.84s)]
*  for Americans out there who [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=153.24s)]
*  think that while this was an [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  American flight, it started in [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=155.84s)]
*  Minnesota and ended up in [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=157.88s)]
*  Toronto. So typically the NTSB [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=159.48s)]
*  would be the agency that would [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=161.72s)]
*  be investigating this. But [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  instead it is the Canadian [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=164.92s)]
*  authorities that are taking the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  lead with NTSB running [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=167.72s)]
*  assistance on this and no [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  doubt they are going to be [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=171.16s)]
*  examining that footage, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=172.6s)]
*  interviewing some of the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=173.96s)]
*  survivors. And I think that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  some of the survivor accounts, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=177.08s)]
*  one FAA administrator, former [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=179.28s)]
*  FAA administrator, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=181.08s)]
*  administrator, I should say, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=182.56s)]
*  says that this is nothing short [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=184.08s)]
*  of a miracle that all 80 people [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=185.52s)]
*  on board this flight were able [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=188.36s)]
*  to get off alive. Now there are [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=190.8s)]
*  two people we are learning who [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=193.6s)]
*  are in critical condition and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=195.04s)]
*  in a hospital here, a 40 year [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=196.6s)]
*  old woman, a 60 year old man, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=198.2s)]
*  another 19 people have minor to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=200.4s)]
*  be. And this is for so many [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=204.12s)]
*  Canadians, eerily reminiscent [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=205.6s)]
*  of a crash that happened nearly [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=207.16s)]
*  two decades ago at this very [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=209.76s)]
*  airport with some 300 people [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=212.0s)]
*  on board where the plane skid [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=214.44s)]
*  along the runway also burst [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  into flame. Everyone on that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=218.12s)]
*  flight miraculously also made [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  it out alive. And so, you know, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=221.72s)]
*  this is deja vu all over again, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  if you will, for a number of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=225.32s)]
*  Canadians who watched in horror [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=227.12s)]
*  and shock as this plane did the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=229.16s)]
*  exact same thing yesterday. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=231.72s)]
*  Right. And we are only in the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=233.84s)]
*  month of February and it seems [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=235.24s)]
*  like we continue for our [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=236.76s)]
*  dinnertime headlines to see [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=238.24s)]
*  crash after crash, incident [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=239.68s)]
*  after incident. Even the most [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=241.16s)]
*  level headed person, Tom, may [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=243.24s)]
*  ask the question, should I feel [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=244.88s)]
*  safe getting on an airplane [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omA0yM3D1k&t=246.32s)]
