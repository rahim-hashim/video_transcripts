# Top government ethics official fired by Trump speaks out
**CBS News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg)
*  One of those recently let go by the Trump administration was a guy named David Heitema, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=0.0s)]
*  person responsible for overseeing ethics for the entire federal government. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=4.7s)]
*  Today, we spoke with him here in Washington and asked him how he found out he was being [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=8.74s)]
*  let go. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=13.38s)]
*  I received a short, to the point, two-sentence email from someone with the White House's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=14.38s)]
*  Office of Presidential Personnel that essentially just said, on behalf of the president, he [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=21.28s)]
*  was informing me that I was removed from my position as director of OGE and thanking me [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=26.7s)]
*  for my service, and that was that. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=32.78s)]
*  I hear all the time about people who have gotten that kind of an email. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=34.46s)]
*  What was your reaction when you read it? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=38.54s)]
*  I'd say the overall emotion is really one of great disappointment. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=40.34s)]
*  This job that I was appointed to is supposed to be a five-year fixed term, so you kind [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=48.1s)]
*  of know going in that you will be serving across multiple administrations. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=55.28s)]
*  That was something I was considered, I had considered. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=60.36s)]
*  I was committed for the five years. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=63.44s)]
*  I was committed to working in good faith with any administration, including this one. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  I thought we were off to a good start. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=72.44s)]
*  I really loved our mission and our team, so it's really a disappointment at that personal level. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=75.68s)]
*  There are now at least eight inspectors general who were fired, a woman who was on the Merit [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=82.04s)]
*  Systems Protection Board, a handful of other people who are either suing or thinking about [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=88.08000000000001s)]
*  suing to get their jobs back or to at least make the legal point that what the president [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=94.84s)]
*  did was illegal in removing them. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=99.16000000000001s)]
*  Are you considering any legal action? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=101.56s)]
*  This is all still so new and sudden for me. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=103.84s)]
*  I really have no idea what's coming next and I'm just starting to turn my mind in that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=106.76s)]
*  direction, so I'm really not sure. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=113.4s)]
*  I think it underscores the point. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  The one comfort is it doesn't appear to be personal. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=119.68s)]
*  I'm in good company. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=122.44s)]
*  It really speaks, I think, to an effort to dismantle all of the institutions across the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  government that are set up to serve as kind of an independent voice for integrity and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=134.12s)]
*  for accountability. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=140.24s)]
*  Given this focus on officials like yourself who were holding what were traditionally nonpartisan [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=141.60000000000002s)]
*  positions and ousting them often late on a Friday night, where do you fall on that debate [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  over whether it's a constitutional crisis or something else? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=154.4s)]
*  I can speak to my position, what happened to me, and the role of the Office of Government [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=157.36s)]
*  Ethics. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=162.68s)]
*  It was Congress that established OGE. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=164.36s)]
*  It was in the wake of Watergate around the same time as the modern IG establishment was [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=167.16s)]
*  created. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=174.44s)]
*  The whole notion and structure was to have an organization still within the executive [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=176.68s)]
*  branch but able to take a nonpartisan, nonpoliticized, matter of fact, by the book approach and be [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=182.68s)]
*  that voice of integrity where it's needed. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  I do think it's true that my removal from this position flies in the face of that vision [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=196.52s)]
*  of Congress. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  In that sense, there is a problem in terms of honoring legislation and the legislative [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=204.60000000000002s)]
*  intent. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=211.56s)]
*  In the four years of the first Trump administration, there was a lot of concern about whether the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=213.44s)]
*  guardrails would hold. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=215.16s)]
*  You think they're going to hold over these four years? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=217.84s)]
*  I don't know, and I guess I will be watching from the sidelines now. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW45t4bzjg&t=220.64000000000001s)]
