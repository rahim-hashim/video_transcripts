# Biden issues a warning to Americans about abuses of power, military industrial complex and AI
**CBS News:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os)
*  That's why my farewell address tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=0.0s)]
*  I want to warn the country of some things that give me great concern. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=3.6s)]
*  This is a dangerous concentration — and that's a dangerous concentration of power [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=8.98s)]
*  in the hands of a very few ultra-wealthy people. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=11.84s)]
*  The dangerous consequences if their abuse of power is left unchecked. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=16.28s)]
*  Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power, and influence that [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=21.48s)]
*  threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms, and a fair shot for everyone [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=28.56s)]
*  to get ahead. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=35.88s)]
*  We see the consequences all across America, and we've seen it before. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  More than a century ago, the American people stood up to the robber barons back then and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=43.28s)]
*  busted the trusts. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=50.08s)]
*  They didn't punish the wealthy. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=52.6s)]
*  This made the wealthy pay the — played by the rules everybody else had to. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=54.64s)]
*  Workers wanted rights to earn their fair share. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=58.8s)]
*  You know, they were dealt into the deal and it helped put us on a path to building the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=61.52s)]
*  largest middle class, the most prosperous century any nation in the world has ever seen. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  We've got to do that again. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=74.04s)]
*  In the last four years, that is exactly what we've done. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=76.4s)]
*  People should be able to make as much as they can, but pay — play by the same rules. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=80.96s)]
*  Pay their fair share in taxes. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=86.19999999999999s)]
*  So much is at stake. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=89.1s)]
*  Right now, the existential threat of climate change has never been clear. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=91.36s)]
*  Just look across the country, from California to North Carolina. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=97.63999999999999s)]
*  That's why I signed the most significant climate and clean energy law ever, ever in [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=102.72s)]
*  And the rest of the world is trying to model it now. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=108.4s)]
*  It's working, creating jobs and industries of the future. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=111.04s)]
*  Now, we've proven we don't have to choose between protecting the environment and growing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=116.04s)]
*  the economy. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  We're doing both. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  The powerful forces want to wield their unchecked influence to eliminate the steps we've taken [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  to tackle the climate crisis, to serve their own interests for power and profit. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=130.08s)]
*  We must not be bullied into sacrificing the future — the future of our children and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=136.72s)]
*  our grandchildren. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=141.44s)]
*  We must keep pushing forward and push faster. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=142.44s)]
*  There's no time to waste. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=146.84s)]
*  It's also clear that American leadership in technology is an unparalleled — an unparalleled [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=149.32s)]
*  source of innovation that can transform lives. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=155.24s)]
*  We see the same dangers of a concentration of technology, power, and wealth. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=160.04s)]
*  You know, as Farewell addressed, President Eisenhower spoke of the dangers of the military-industrial [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=166.28s)]
*  complex. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=171.68s)]
*  He warned us then about, and I quote, the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  power, end of quote. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  Six days — six decades later, I'm equally concerned about the potential rise of a tech-industrial [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=182.28s)]
*  complex that could pose real dangers for our country as well. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=189.6s)]
*  Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation enabling [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=195.76s)]
*  the abuse of power. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=201.92s)]
*  The free press is crumbling. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=203.68s)]
*  Editors are disappearing. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=205.72s)]
*  Social media is giving up on fact-checking. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  The truth is smothered by lies told for power and for profit. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=211.84s)]
*  We must hold the social platform accountable to protect our children, our families, and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=217.36s)]
*  our very democracy from the abuse of power. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=223.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, artificial intelligence is the most consequential technology of our time, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=228.0s)]
*  perhaps of all time. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=234.52s)]
*  Nothing offers more profound possibilities and risks for our economy and our security, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=236.88000000000002s)]
*  our society, for humanity. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=244.36s)]
*  Artificial intelligence even has the potential to help us answer my call to end cancer as [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=249.04000000000002s)]
*  we know it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=252.72000000000003s)]
*  But unless safeguards are in place, AI could spawn new threats to our rights, our way of [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=253.72000000000003s)]
*  life, to our privacy, how we work and how we protect our nation. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=260.2s)]
*  We must make sure AI is safe and trustworthy and good for all humankind. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=265.24s)]
*  In the age of AI, it's more important than ever that the people must govern. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=272.08s)]
*  And as the land of liberty, America, not China, must lead the world in the development of [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=278.84s)]
*  AI. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=285.52s)]
*  You know, in the years ahead, it'll help to be — it's going to be up to the president, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=286.52s)]
*  the presidency, the Congress, the courts, the free press, and the American people to [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=293.64s)]
*  confront these powerful forces. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  We must reform the tax code, not by giving the biggest tax cuts to billionaires, but [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=301.68s)]
*  by making them begin to pay their fair share. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=306.6s)]
*  We need to get dark money. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=309.6s)]
*  That's that hidden funding behind too many campaign contributions. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=311.0s)]
*  We need to get it out of our politics. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=314.36s)]
*  We need to enact an 18-year time limit, term limit, time and term, for the strongest ethics [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=317.8s)]
*  reform — and the strongest ethics reforms for our Supreme Court. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=324.24s)]
*  We need to ban members of Congress from trading stock while they're in the Congress. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=328.1s)]
*  We need to amend the Constitution to make clear that no president — no president is [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=334.38s)]
*  immune from crimes that he or she commits while in office. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=338.62s)]
*  The president's power is not limited. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=343.1s)]
*  It's not absolute. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=345.90000000000003s)]
*  And it shouldn't be. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=347.38s)]
*  And in a democracy, there's another danger to the concentration of power and wealth. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=349.38s)]
*  It erodes a sense of unity and common purpose. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=356.18s)]
*  It causes distrust and division. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=359.78000000000003s)]
*  Participating in our democracy becomes exhausting and even disillusioning. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=363.26s)]
*  And people don't feel like they have a fair shot. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=368.1s)]
*  We have to stay engaged in the process. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=372.18s)]
*  I know it's frustrating. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=374.86s)]
*  A fair shot is what makes America America. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=377.12s)]
*  Everyone's entitled to a fair shot — not a guarantee, but just a fair shot. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=380.94s)]
*  And even playing field. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=385.34s)]
*  Going as far as your hard work and talent can take you. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=387.73999999999995s)]
*  We can never lose that essential truth. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=391.9s)]
*  We remain who we are. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN2jc4st_Os&t=393.9s)]
