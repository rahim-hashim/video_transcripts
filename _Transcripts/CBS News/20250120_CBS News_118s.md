*  O say can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Prif4YwDg&t=0.0s)]
*  last gleaming, Whose broad stripes and bright stars, O'er the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Prif4YwDg&t=27.0s)]
*  and the ramparts were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Prif4YwDg&t=41.56s)]
*  Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there, O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Prif4YwDg&t=57.56s)]

*  Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Prif4YwDg&t=112.56s)]
