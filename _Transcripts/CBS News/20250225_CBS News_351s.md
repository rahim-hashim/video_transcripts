# White House pressed on email to federal employees, DOGE leadership
**CBS News:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ)
*  There's a new series of executive orders coming this afternoon from President Trump at the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=0.0s)]
*  The details of the orders haven't been released, but we could hear something soon. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=4.28s)]
*  For now, we're seeing the first potential cracks inside Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=8.36s)]
*  At least 20 civil service workers are resigning from Doge, saying they refuse to use their technical expertise to, quote, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=14.84s)]
*  dismantle critical public services. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=20.96s)]
*  And the confusion is growing among many federal government workers. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=23.8s)]
*  The Office of Personnel Management says employee responses to the email from Elon Musk requiring them to list their accomplishments are voluntary, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=26.96s)]
*  and each agency head can decide how they want to proceed. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=34.8s)]
*  That directive contradicts what Elon Musk himself said. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=38.44s)]
*  He said Monday workers had another, quote, another chance to justify their work without providing a deadline. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=41.72s)]
*  And he posted on his social media platform X that, quote, failure to respond a second time will result in termination. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=47.44s)]
*  White House press secretary Caroline Lovett addressed the confusion earlier. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=53.76s)]
*  The Office of Personnel Management sent out additional guidance last night. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=57.4s)]
*  Those responses should be directed to agency leadership. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=61.12s)]
*  And the president defers to his cabinet secretaries, who he's obviously entrusted to pursue the guidance relative to their specific workforce. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=64.48s)]
*  And for some of the agencies that you've seen who have said, please don't send these emails, it's in their best interest for that specific agency. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=72.92s)]
*  And the president supports that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=79.16s)]
*  And let me be very clear. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=80.76s)]
*  The president and Elon is his entire cabinet are working as one unified team and they are implementing these very common sense solutions. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=82.12s)]
*  Lovett also confirmed Musk will attend the first official meeting of President Trump's cabinet tomorrow. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=96.2s)]
*  Nancy, what can you tell us here about some of the executive orders that President Trump is expected to sign today? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=99.16000000000001s)]
*  Hey, Lindsey. So we just got out of a very contentious White House press briefing where the White House press secretary, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=106.64s)]
*  Caroline Lovett, was pressed on who exactly is running Doge. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=113.83999999999999s)]
*  This comes amidst a flurry of new warnings and new threats for government workers telling them if they didn't fill out that email [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=119.6s)]
*  listing their five bullet points of accomplishments by later tonight that they're going to be fired or as President Trump put it yesterday, semi-fired. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=129.36s)]
*  And so this is leading to a lot of confusion, a lot of concern among federal workers who don't know what to do. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=140.76000000000002s)]
*  A lot of them have agency heads who are telling them not to respond to this email, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=147.28000000000003s)]
*  that there are national security concerns about them responding to this email or that Doge doesn't have the authority to ask them this. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=152.12s)]
*  And so a lot of people pressed Caroline Lovett in that briefing about who exactly it is that is running Doge, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=160.56s)]
*  this effort that is working to identify tens of thousands of federal workers to let go and tens of millions, if not billions of dollars worth of cuts to make. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=168.0s)]
*  And she really couldn't identify who it is. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=179.0s)]
*  I asked her if it was Elon Musk. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=181.56s)]
*  She said it's not. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=183.0s)]
*  At one point, towards the end of the briefing, she actually said there is somebody who is running it, but she didn't want to say that person's name. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  And so this is leading to a great deal of confusion because this is somebody who apparently has a great deal of power within the federal government [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  making major decisions about who stays and who goes. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=202.20000000000002s)]
*  And the Trump White House can't identify who that person is. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=205.88s)]
*  And there appears to be a growing number of employees actually leaving Doge. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=210.76s)]
*  What more are we learning? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=214.0s)]
*  Right. So there was a letter that was issued today, fascinating by 21 individuals. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  They did not provide their names, but they say that they are all engineers, project managers, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=220.28s)]
*  people who once worked in senior positions in the tech sector, who left to join the federal government and be part of what was once called the U.S. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=225.88s)]
*  digital service aimed at modernizing the federal government's computer systems. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  It was kind of subsumed by Doge about a month ago when President Trump issued his executive order. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=240.76s)]
*  And so a lot of these people were here before the current administration. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=247.2s)]
*  They said about a third of their operation was laid off right off the bat. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=252.0s)]
*  And they say that they stayed on, but now they are leaving because they don't want to be a part of what Doge is doing. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=257.12s)]
*  They say that Doge's efforts to make cuts have been haphazard, that this operation has been secretive. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=264.6s)]
*  Sometimes they were questioned by people who wouldn't tell them their names. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  And so they are speaking out, albeit anonymously, to say that they are now leaving because they're not going to be a part, they say, of what Doge is attempting to do. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=276.6s)]
*  How significant is that? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=285.72s)]
*  Well, it shines a bit of light on what's been going on. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=288.76000000000005s)]
*  We've had so much difficulty just getting basic information about how Doge works and what the chain of command looks like. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=292.44s)]
*  Do cabinet secretaries, for example, have the ultimate say about who gets fired and which projects get cut? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=301.32s)]
*  Or is it Doge that has the ultimate say? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=307.32s)]
*  And if Doge has the ultimate say, who is Doge? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=310.0s)]
*  Who's running it? We know the names of some of the people who are working for it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=312.96s)]
*  But who is the person who is making those calls that have such a significant and lasting impact on government programs and government workers? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=316.0s)]
*  And so it'll be interesting to see if any of these individuals now that they have resigned decide to actually come forward and kind of peel back the curtain and tell us a little bit more about the Doge operation, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=325.52s)]
*  how it worked and what they were told to do, what they refuse to do and what they think the end goals of the operation are. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=336.72s)]
*  Sounds like an existential question. What is Doge? Who is Doge? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  All right, Nancy Cortez, thank you. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxH1Zm6QrBQ&t=348.92s)]
