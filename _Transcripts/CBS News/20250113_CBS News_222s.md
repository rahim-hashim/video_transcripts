# Confirmation hearings for Trump Cabinet picks begin this week
**CBS News:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ)
*  All right, let's get you a live look at Capitol Hill this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And it's going to be a busy week there. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=2.08s)]
*  You've got several of Donald Trump's cabinet [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=3.68s)]
*  picks facing confirmation hearings. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=5.48s)]
*  First on the docket is the president-elect's controversial [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  choice for defense secretary. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=10.68s)]
*  That's Pete Hegseth. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=12.08s)]
*  He's a former Fox News host who served in the military in Iraq [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=13.48s)]
*  and in Afghanistan. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  His hearing takes place tomorrow. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=18.56s)]
*  Wednesday, Florida Senator Marco Rubio [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=20.64s)]
*  will face questions from his colleagues. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=22.48s)]
*  He's up for the position of Trump's secretary of state. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=24.36s)]
*  The president-elect's pick for attorney general, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=27.24s)]
*  Pam Bondi, will also have a hearing that same day. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=29.48s)]
*  And Thursday, House Republican Conference Chair Elise [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=32.72s)]
*  Stefanik, that's Trump's pick for ambassador to the UN. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=35.12s)]
*  She's scheduled to be there on the Hill. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=38.6s)]
*  And a Senate Democratic source is telling CBS News, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=41.04s)]
*  minority leader Chuck Schumer is telling members, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=44.32s)]
*  this week's hearings will be a good opportunity [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  to hold the nominees' feet to the fire. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=49.36s)]
*  He wants Democrats to push them on how [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  they plan to make good on Trump's many campaign promises. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=54.16s)]
*  For more on all of this, let's bring in CBS News [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=58.48s)]
*  political reporter, Shona Mazzell. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=60.32s)]
*  She's joining us, I believe, from Florida. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=62.16s)]
*  Shona, is the Trump team really expecting [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=65.28s)]
*  a smooth confirmation process? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=67.12s)]
*  Because Democrats are signaling they plan to, you know, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=69.2s)]
*  figuratively beat these nominees up. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=72.28s)]
*  Hey, Errol, good morning. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=77.08s)]
*  And you're right, these confirmation hearings [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=78.32s)]
*  can be extremely contentious, but Team Trump [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=80.12s)]
*  is expressing a lot of confidence going into this. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  We know that these hearings come after weeks and weeks [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=86.08000000000001s)]
*  of these nominees meeting with Capitol Hill Republicans [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=89.28s)]
*  and attempting to garner their support, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=92.68s)]
*  but also attempting to get ahead of any concerns [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=94.64s)]
*  or questions that could come up in these confirmation hearings. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=97.16000000000001s)]
*  And what's really important here is that Democrats actually [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  aren't needed to push these nominees through, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=103.0s)]
*  because Republicans do have the majority in the Senate. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=105.36000000000001s)]
*  Now, I know the hearing has not yet [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  been scheduled for Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=110.12s)]
*  That's Trump's pick for DNI, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=111.76s)]
*  Director of National Intelligence. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=113.56s)]
*  Yesterday on Face the Nation, Senator John Barrasso said [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  that was due to a paperwork problem. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=118.28s)]
*  Let's just play that clip. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  It's a paperwork problem right now [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  with the Office of Government Ethics. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=124.12s)]
*  We had hoped to have the hearing later this week. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  It looks like it's gonna be the following week, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=128.8s)]
*  but she continues to have promotions in the military. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  She's a lieutenant colonel. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=134.0s)]
*  She now has top-level security clearances. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=135.52s)]
*  She's the right person to keep America secure and safe. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=138.72s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  So is that delay causing any concerns in the Trump team? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=143.2s)]
*  Well, with so many other confirmation hearings [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=148.32s)]
*  happening this week, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=150.48s)]
*  the fact that Tulsi Gabbard will not have one [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=151.36s)]
*  certainly draws attention and does beg that question. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=153.44s)]
*  But as you heard from Barrasso, Senate Republicans [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=156.64s)]
*  are still expressing support and rallying behind her. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=158.96s)]
*  And just last week, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=161.8s)]
*  Gabbard continued those meetings up on Capitol Hill [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=162.92s)]
*  in an effort to garner that support. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=165.88s)]
*  And last week, she also met with the current director [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=167.72s)]
*  of national intelligence. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=170.4s)]
*  Obviously, that's the post that she would be hoping to fill [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=171.68s)]
*  if pushed through in her confirmation process [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  whenever her hearing does take place. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=176.44s)]
*  And Shauna, we understand that in order to smooth [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=178.16s)]
*  some of their rough edges, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=180.28s)]
*  some cabinet picks are reversing [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=182.0s)]
*  some of their more controversial stances. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=183.96s)]
*  Well, can you tell us about that? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, Gabbard, in fact, who we just talked about, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=189.88s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, when she was a member in Congress, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=191.88s)]
*  she was very vocal. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=194.0s)]
*  She was an opponent, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=195.36s)]
*  and she voted against FISA authorization. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=196.24s)]
*  Now, what this is, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=198.96s)]
*  is overseas surveillance of non-American citizens. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=199.88s)]
*  She said that this program needed reform, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  but just last week, she reversed this position. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=205.24s)]
*  And this position was actually a sticking point [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  for Democrats and Republicans. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=209.72s)]
*  And so this reversal could indicate [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=211.32000000000002s)]
*  that she is really seeking to do whatever she needs to do [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  to be able to get approved and confirmed for DNI. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=215.84s)]
*  All right, Shauna Mazzell from West Palm Beach. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EntWe9plvQ&t=220.56s)]
