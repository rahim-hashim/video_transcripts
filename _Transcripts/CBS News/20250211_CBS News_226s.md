# Where the 2026 House map stands for Democrats
**CBS News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8)
*  Welcome back. You stayed all the way to the end. Thank you. You're not thinking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=0.0s)]
*  about the House races in 2026, nor should you be, but here's a fact. House [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=4.32s)]
*  members are, and people who want to join the House of Representatives are, and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=8.92s)]
*  that means planning, preparations, analysis already underway. The [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Nonpartisan Cook Political Report has quite helpfully put out a new list of 18 [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=17.92s)]
*  potential toss-up races that could very much inform us about the next majority [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  in the House of Representatives. For more on this, I want to bring in Erin Covey. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=30.04s)]
*  For analysis, she leads the Cook Political Report's coverage of the House. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=32.76s)]
*  It's great to have you with us. So, too early for lots of people, but not too [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=36.24s)]
*  early for us to have this conversation, and most especially not too early for [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=41.4s)]
*  the members of the House and those who would like to be in the member, like to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=45.36s)]
*  become future members of the House. So what 18 races has the Cook Political [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=47.88s)]
*  Report looked at and said, hey, these are ones to keep an eye on, and why? So it's [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=52.64s)]
*  never too early for us, and off years don't really exist anymore. So we are [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=56.72s)]
*  always on, and we have released our House and Senate and governor's race [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=61.32s)]
*  ratings now. Now, obviously, we have over 600 days until the midterms, so [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=64.84s)]
*  environmentally, we don't know what that's going to look like, and a lot could [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=69.52s)]
*  change. But right now, it looks like the battleground of competitive House races [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=72.48s)]
*  is relatively small, so Democrats would only need to pick up three seats on net [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=76.28s)]
*  to take control of the House next year. So, theoretically, that should be a very [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=81.4s)]
*  doable opportunity for them. But the battleground itself is relatively evenly [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  divided. We have 18 true toss-up races, in total about 39 competitive races, and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=91.0s)]
*  between those two 18 toss-up races, we have 10 held by Democrats and eight held [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=97.64s)]
*  by Republicans. Many of the Democrats in these toss-up seats are folks that we [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=102.52s)]
*  know and have heard of before, Jared Golden in Maine, Marie Glousencamp-Perez [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  in Washington, Marcy Kaptur in Ohio. These are all seats that Trump has carried [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=112.28s)]
*  previously, so they are going to have to win over a significant number of Trump [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=117.08s)]
*  voters to win re-election next year. And is there anything thematic about these [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=120.64s)]
*  toss-up House races? It's hard to put a theme to it. They're geographically very [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=127.36s)]
*  diverse, spread out all over the map, as the map just showed, yeah. All around the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=132.28s)]
*  map. Some of these are in presidential battleground states. We have some [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  competitive seats in Pennsylvania and Arizona that are often competitive, but [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=139.88s)]
*  we also have seats in California and New York. And so it is pretty diverse [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=144.12s)]
*  geographically, diverse racially too. I think the main thing drawing all of these [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=148.76s)]
*  seats together is in most of these cases, we have members who are going to have to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=154.48s)]
*  reach out to voters who may have voted differently last year. And very quickly, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=159.56s)]
*  you have some updated Senate analysis. Michigan and Georgia toss-ups. Yes, so the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=163.64s)]
*  Senate is much harder for Democrats. Currently we have only five Senate seats [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=169.64s)]
*  that are rated as competitive. That's New Hampshire and Georgia and Michigan, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=173.92s)]
*  which are held by Democrats, North Carolina and Maine, which are held by [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=178.48s)]
*  Republicans. So even if Democrats hold the three seats that are competitive and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=181.48s)]
*  flip the two Republican-held seats, there's still two seats short of a [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  majority. So we're not really expecting Democrats take back the majority next [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  year, but of course it is very early and other states could join the map later on. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=193.32s)]
*  And John Ossoff was a big winner. Now he's in a toss-up category. Is that a race to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  keep a very close eye on? Absolutely. I think he's probably the most vulnerable [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=203.52s)]
*  senator from both parties. From either party. Right now. And he will be facing [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=206.96s)]
*  reelection in an environment that should be better for Democrats, but it is going [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=212.56s)]
*  to be a difficult state. This is a state that Trump carried last year, and so he's [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  also going to have to win over Trump voters to win reelection. Aaron Covey, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=220.88s)]
*  please come back. I appreciate the time and the expertise. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGMj2xGNo8&t=224.0s)]
