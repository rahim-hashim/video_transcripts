# Breaking down Biden's farewell address
**CBS News:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo)
*  President Joe Biden, in his final Oval Office address to the nation, not only touting his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=0.0s)]
*  accomplishments as president—17 million jobs, he says, that he has created—also [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=7.62s)]
*  talking about strengthening NATO—and then ending his remarks with a warning, warning [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  of an unelected oligarchy of tech barons essentially taking power in America. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=19.42s)]
*  And Biden's echoing Dwight Eisenhower's warning about a military-industrial complex [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=26.0s)]
*  that will certainly make news, as it was striking to hear the president say Americans face a [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=31.68s)]
*  choice now to stand up to abuse of power or to yield to it, and then at the same time [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=37.2s)]
*  wishing the new Trump administration well. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  Want to bring in Face the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  It has been a busy day. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=49.24s)]
*  We'll talk about the hostage deal. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  But first, the president's final remarks. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  And guard was a phrase he used. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=56.0s)]
*  This was a warning, as you said, and that really is extraordinary. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=58.96s)]
*  It wasn't the fond farewell, perhaps, that we were prepared for. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=62.56s)]
*  With the president really just rattling off, as you said, a number of warnings of the guardrails [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=66.52s)]
*  of democracy that he says are in peril, one of them are very industry. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=71.4s)]
*  He said the free press is crumbling, pointing to social media, making that connection back [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  to technology and lack of fact-checking. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=79.28s)]
*  He talked about the need to hold accountable social platforms. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=81.86s)]
*  All of this seemingly in that space framed around some of the political forces of the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=85.56s)]
*  moment who are aligned with Donald Trump, although his successor was not named there. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=90.56s)]
*  Some of the CEOs who have come out and said that they're going to attend the inauguration. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=96.16s)]
*  You have to imagine he wrote this with them in mind. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=99.64s)]
*  But also warning on the national security front saying that this next generation is [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=102.24s)]
*  going to be really shaped by artificial intelligence, AI, said it is the most consequential technology [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=107.28s)]
*  and really called for safeguards there. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  Having opened with the idea that we, he said, moved forward against China in that competition [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=117.52s)]
*  over this technology space, really warning that it's not just a foe from without that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=123.84s)]
*  can weaponize technology, but from within the threats to the forces that are underpinning [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=129.72s)]
*  our democracy. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=136.24s)]
*  Robert Checking and the basics. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=137.24s)]
*  Robert Costa is with us. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=139.08s)]
*  Well, you've covered the president, interviewed him several months ago. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=140.52s)]
*  What did you make of his final speech? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=144.06s)]
*  Well, at one level, it was deeply personal, nor you did see the photos of the family sitting [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=145.7s)]
*  behind President Biden, including his late son, Bo Biden. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=150.5s)]
*  Earlier today, I was at the Capitol meeting with President Biden's close friends like [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=154.02s)]
*  Senator Chris Coons, and they expected him to advocate for his record. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=157.38s)]
*  But what was most striking was what you mentioned, the echo of Dwight D. Eisenhower. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=161.46s)]
*  January 17th, 1961, President Eisenhower, in his own farewell address, warned the nation [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=165.7s)]
*  of a so-called military industrial complex. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=172.02s)]
*  Now President Biden, as he departs the presidency, is warning of a, quote, tech industrial complex. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=175.34s)]
*  And this comes as Elon Musk, the billionaire, and others like Jeff Bezos are prepared to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=181.06s)]
*  sit on that dais at the inaugural for President-elect Donald Trump on January 20th. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=185.26000000000002s)]
*  And you see President Biden, who began his career as Scranton Joe, as someone who was [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=190.5s)]
*  an advocate for working people, ending his presidency as someone underscoring his own [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=195.02s)]
*  progressive values, really sending a signal to the left in this country that he stood [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=200.02s)]
*  with them on their core economic issues. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=205.42s)]
*  I want to bring in Weijia Jiang. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=207.94s)]
*  She is our senior White House correspondent outside the White House. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=209.66s)]
*  Weijia, you have covered this president so closely. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=213.46s)]
*  What do you make of how he made up this address? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=216.7s)]
*  Not only the accomplishments that he feels he did not get credit for, but also this warning [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=219.06s)]
*  in a very populous tone. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=224.34s)]
*  Well, Nora, frankly, I expected much more about his accomplishments and his personal [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=227.70000000000002s)]
*  story in this farewell address, because White House sources had talked about, leading up [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=233.5s)]
*  to this moment, how this was not just an exit from the White House, but this was an exit [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=239.26000000000002s)]
*  from 50 years of his public service. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=244.18s)]
*  And he really wanted this to be personal and positive and nonpartisan. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=247.02s)]
*  But certainly, his message was dark in many ways as he issued those warnings. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=253.1s)]
*  And even though he did not mention any of his political opponents by name, including [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=257.7s)]
*  Trump, even though he did not talk about those tech tycoons who are now weaved into the Trump [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=262.38s)]
*  administration, certainly almost every warning he had was a veiled strike at them, whether [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=268.1s)]
*  it was a mis- and disinformation, talking about the lack of fact-checking on social [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=274.82s)]
*  media platforms after Mark Zuckerberg announced their new policy, whether it was about the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=280.06s)]
*  concentration of wealth, and you're talking about some of the richest men in the world [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=285.34s)]
*  now in his orbit, whether he's talking about AI safeguards. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=290.38s)]
*  And so I thought it was really interesting that he chose to spend so much time on those [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=294.74s)]
*  things, Nora, instead of his legacy. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=299.78s)]
*  But he will be making several more speeches this week, so he'll have more chances to [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=302.36s)]
*  do that. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=306.54s)]
*  Nora? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=307.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=309.02000000000004s)]
*  I want to bring in our chief White House correspondent, Nancy Cordes. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=310.02000000000004s)]
*  She is with President-elect Trump in West Palm Beach, Florida. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=312.58000000000004s)]
*  And Nancy, that warning from President Biden about what this new Trump White House may [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=316.82s)]
*  look like, and in his words, to stand guard, as Margaret said, or stand up to abuse of [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=323.34000000000003s)]
*  power is what he was concerned about tonight. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=329.42s)]
*  Right, Nora. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=331.94s)]
*  Right, Nora. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=333.34s)]
*  In fact, he started this speech much in the same way he started his inaugural address [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=334.34s)]
*  nearly four years ago, talking about the need to defend democracy. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=339.38s)]
*  And the subtext there is not going to be lost on Donald Trump or his supporters here in [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=344.58s)]
*  West Palm Beach, because normally when Joe Biden talks about defending democracy, he [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=350.1s)]
*  is talking about Donald Trump, who he has described several times as a threat to democracy. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=355.22s)]
*  And what was fascinating was that even as Biden was speaking, Donald Trump was posting, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=362.5s)]
*  not on X, owned by Elon Musk, but on his site, Truth Social, that as he fills out the ranks [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=367.58000000000004s)]
*  of his administration, he doesn't want to hire anyone who has worked for someone he [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=374.3s)]
*  views as disloyal or as an enemy. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=379.94000000000005s)]
*  And he actually helpfully put out a list of people who fit that category. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=382.86s)]
*  Don't send me any names of anyone who has worked for Mike Pence, his former vice president, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=388.5s)]
*  or Paul Ryan, or Liz Cheney, or her father, the former vice president, Dick Cheney. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=395.18s)]
*  I'm not hiring them. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=400.66s)]
*  The message he's clearly sending, I only want to hire people who are true believers. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=402.22s)]
*  Nancy Cordes in West Palm Beach, where that transition is underway. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=408.46000000000004s)]
*  Nancy, thank you. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=412.1s)]
*  Want to bring in our senior White House and political correspondent, Ed. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=413.7s)]
*  Ed, you heard President Biden mention the seeds are planted. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=418.62s)]
*  He's talking about the idea. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=423.3s)]
*  Well, you may not be feeling the benefit of all of my big policy ideas. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=424.62s)]
*  I know inflation still exists, but the seeds are there and you will eventually feel them. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=429.06s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=433.26s)]
*  As you mentioned, 39% approval rating, not the greatest number to go out with. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=434.26s)]
*  But what he's hoping for, what he's signaling, is that history is going to be kinder to him. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=437.22s)]
*  And he's, in recent interviews, he's lamented the fact that when various COVID stimulus [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=441.42s)]
*  checks went out in the early years of his presidency, he didn't sign them and put his [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=446.32s)]
*  name on them to reinforce that it was him who was helping Americans, believing now in [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=450.03999999999996s)]
*  hindsight that that would have helped in the short term, at least shore up the belief among [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=454.53999999999996s)]
*  Americans that he was doing what he could to help. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=458.64s)]
*  And so saying the seeds are planted and they'll grow and bloom for generations to come. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=461.28s)]
*  He's speaking to his infrastructure plan, the COVID relief that was established, the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=464.79999999999995s)]
*  fact that his administration at least worked to support and protect Ukraine in its ongoing [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=469.4s)]
*  struggle with Russia. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=474.08s)]
*  And it's a statement that other unpopular presidents have made as well. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=476.08s)]
*  George W. Bush is the one that comes to mind most immediately, who said, I'm more worried [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=479.04s)]
*  about what history will say about me. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=482.44s)]
*  And even a few years removed since, given the whims of the Republican Party and the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=484.16s)]
*  way the world has gone, history is already treating him kinder than it was in the beginning. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=488.32s)]
*  To the point about oligarchy, Nora, also important to remember, he's not the first American [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=492.52s)]
*  president to warn of this. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=496.48s)]
*  John Adams wrote about the few, the well-born and the rich, and concerns that this country [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=497.56s)]
*  was going to put too much emphasis on them. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=502.6s)]
*  This is a problem that's come up before and has been addressed, and he's signaling [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=505.24s)]
*  to his party tonight. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=508.24s)]
*  Focus on that, that populist message, and maybe that's the way to win back the White [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=509.96000000000004s)]
*  House. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=512.96s)]
*  Ed O'Keefe, thank you. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=513.96s)]
*  I also want to focus on the big news of the day, carried out with the Biden administration. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=515.96s)]
*  They've been working on this for months at the president's directive, this new ceasefire [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=522.44s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas and this hostage deal. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=526.88s)]
*  Margaret, you've been at the forefront of this reporting. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=530.24s)]
*  How will these three phases of this deal work? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=533.48s)]
*  Well, this is a capstone for Joe Biden, foreign policy legacy so key to him, and it is Donald [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=535.88s)]
*  Trump who will have to execute it. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=540.88s)]
*  So two of the three Americans still in captivity would come out in phase one. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  The other American, Idan Alexander, would come out if Donald Trump can see this all [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=547.28s)]
*  the way through to the end. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=551.28s)]
*  But it's 33 hostages, 42 days. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=552.54s)]
*  If they get to phase two, which would be negotiated over the next six weeks by the Trump administration [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=555.5s)]
*  as well as regional partners Qatar, Egypt and Israel, they'd be able to get to potentially [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  a full withdrawal in that second phase. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=566.36s)]
*  If they can get there, ultimately by phase three, they would be able to bring back and [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=568.8399999999999s)]
*  reclaim the remains of some of the Americans who died in captivity. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=572.9399999999999s)]
*  The president's incoming national security adviser suggested that hostages could be being [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=576.5s)]
*  hugged by their families as Donald Trump is sworn into office. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=580.04s)]
*  Is that a possibility? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=582.6s)]
*  Perhaps even the day prior. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=584.3199999999999s)]
*  By Sunday, we expect to see the first female captives released. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=585.64s)]
*  Margaret Brandon, Robert Costa, to all of our correspondents. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ac2GFVlHo&t=590.24s)]
