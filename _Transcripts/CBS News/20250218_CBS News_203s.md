# Officials provide update on Delta plane crash in Toronto
**CBS News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc)
*  Toronto airport officials say all but two of the people injured yesterday when a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=0.0s)]
*  delta plane crashed and came to rest upside down are out of the hospital. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=5.08s)]
*  Aviation investigators from Canada and the US are now working together to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  determine what caused the accident. Officials delivering an update today [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=13.32s)]
*  said two recent snowstorms forced many flights to be canceled or delayed over [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=17.2s)]
*  the weekend, but they say it's too early to know if weather conditions played a [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=21.92s)]
*  role in yesterday's crash. This would not be a time for us to have theory or [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=25.72s)]
*  to speculate on what caused the crash. So as I shared, you know, we have a [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=30.72s)]
*  number of agencies that are here that are responsible for doing a thorough and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=35.16s)]
*  full and complete investigation to determine all the causal factors. And we [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=39.76s)]
*  are looking forward to getting those results and to sharing those and those [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=44.4s)]
*  will be shared very publicly once they are received. Yesterday's crash happened [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  just weeks after a series of deadly plane crashes in the US. CBS News [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=52.199999999999996s)]
*  correspondent Tom Hanson is in suburban Toronto with more. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=55.68s)]
*  Well, we're getting a little bit clearer of an image of just what happened [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=59.9s)]
*  yesterday in the scene that happened. But the million dollar question remains. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=63.0s)]
*  What was the cause of the crash? We still do not know the answer to that [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  after hearing from the airport CEO here as well as first responders. Now, what [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=71.6s)]
*  she did say was in an event that went was a worst case scenario, if you will, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=76.4s)]
*  the first first responders and the emergency response was very much a best [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=82.60000000000001s)]
*  case scenario. The first responders were carrying out their duties in a way that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=87.12s)]
*  the CEO referred to as textbook. They were quick in their response. They got [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=93.2s)]
*  people out of harm's way in a very challenging scene, given the fact that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=98.22s)]
*  there was some nasty weather conditions, including strong wind gusts up to 37 [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  miles an hour. Now, one of the conditions that they went on to describe in this [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=108.08s)]
*  press conference was the fact that there was jet fuel involved, which is highly [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=112.28s)]
*  flammable. And so when you saw that plane burst into a ball of flames, that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=117.2s)]
*  easily could have been very catastrophic for the people on board. So responding [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=123.12s)]
*  in a timely matter was paramount in getting people out of harm's way safety. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=127.6s)]
*  They also mentioned some of the nature of the injuries that have been reported. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=131.56s)]
*  And while they were not potentially life threatening, that doesn't mean they [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=136.96s)]
*  weren't serious. We're talking about back sprains, neck injuries, head [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=140.6s)]
*  injuries. When you think about the people who were suspended upside down, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=144.96s)]
*  almost like a bat, and then having to detach themselves from the buckle of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=148.96s)]
*  the plane, you're talking about people who were falling to the ground before [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=153.58s)]
*  they could evacuate and get out. But all in all, we still do not know what [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=156.4s)]
*  caused this crash. However, we do know the extent of the investigation or we [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=162.42000000000002s)]
*  can get a clearer picture of that. They did say that the fuselage fuselage will [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=166.84s)]
*  remain on the runway at least for a couple days as they continue their [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=170.72s)]
*  investigation. Presumably the fuselage will be removed once the investigation [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=174.76s)]
*  wraps up for now. It is basically blocking the longest north to south [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=179.12s)]
*  runway, the longest east to west runway. And so those runways will remain [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=184.56s)]
*  closed until this investigation wraps up. But still, as I mentioned, that big [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=189.08s)]
*  question remains what caused the crash in the first place that has yet to be [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=194.51999999999998s)]
*  answered back to you, Tom Hanson. Thank you. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDS2JFOSfqc&t=199.72s)]
