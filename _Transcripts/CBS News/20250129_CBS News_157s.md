# White House reacts to federal funding memo reversal
**CBS News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U)
*  Let's cover some breaking news with you. The White House rescinding its order to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=0.0s)]
*  freeze federal grants and loans. This has really dominated the headlines for [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=4.68s)]
*  the last at least 24-36 hours. What more are we learning about this decision? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=8.72s)]
*  Yeah, this coming in just now. I do want to read part of a statement from [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=12.68s)]
*  Caroline Levitt. She is the press secretary. We got this statement a short [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=16.52s)]
*  while ago, but she said that in light of the injunction, the OMB rescinded the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  memo to end any confusion on the federal policy that Trump signed on an [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=24.44s)]
*  executive order memo that was created by a court ruling, the confusion about that [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=28.66s)]
*  court ruling. We know a court issued a stay on this. This was last night, just [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=33.66s)]
*  minutes before this order was set to take place at 5 p.m., saying that they [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=39.22s)]
*  want to hear more from the plaintiffs, which are nonprofits in this case, and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=43.34s)]
*  Trump's DOJ before making a ruling come next Monday during a hearing. So it's [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=47.22s)]
*  important to note that this is a rescission, this is not a rescission of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=52.42s)]
*  the federal freeze, but rather of the memo. They're making that distinction [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=55.68s)]
*  there, but of course this caused mass chaos and confusion across not only the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=60.2s)]
*  federal government, but state governments yesterday, wondering if they would still [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=64.68s)]
*  have access to Medicaid, to benefits, to certain federal funds that they receive, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=67.8s)]
*  and what exactly this all meant. So the White House trying to clear up some of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=73.16s)]
*  that confusion today, but there's still some outstanding questions here about [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=77.52s)]
*  who exactly this is impacting, but the White House is also saying that they are [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=80.88s)]
*  still moving forward with the federal funding freeze. That means that Trump's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=84.96s)]
*  goal of really rooting out any of these quote pet projects within the federal [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=88.8s)]
*  government that do not align with his executive orders and his priorities will [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=93.88s)]
*  still be rooted out. So important to note there. The threat to certain programs [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=97.88s)]
*  still not over. Olivia, the Trump administration says it still plans to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=102.08s)]
*  move forward with the February 1st deadline to implement tariffs on Canada [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  and Mexico. Does the White House expect today's decision to have any impact on [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=109.28s)]
*  that? Are they pretty steadfast in this February 1st date? Well the February 1st [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  date was set by Trump, something he would like to see as far as those tariffs, but [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=118.36s)]
*  what was important to note today, we actually heard from Howard Lutnick who [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=122.52s)]
*  is talking before the Senate about being the Secretary of Commerce, and he said [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=125.8s)]
*  that that's not a hard and fast date and it's not a hard and fast 25% rule, but [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=130.42000000000002s)]
*  rather the tariffs against Canada and Mexico would be related to any [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=135.88s)]
*  immigration issues. So if they can resolve some of those immigration issues [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=140.12s)]
*  that they have, then they wouldn't put on those tariffs. So a lot to watch [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=143.68s)]
*  there in the coming days. That deadline is coming out as fast and furious. Just [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=147.52s)]
*  another thing to add on of the things we're watching here from the White [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  House. Olivia Rinaldi, thank you. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnwvBAQB23U&t=154.82s)]
