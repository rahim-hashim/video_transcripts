# Why officials believe deaths of Gene Hackman, wife are "suspicious enough" to investigate
**CBS News:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU)
*  Police in New Mexico say the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Gene Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa appear, quote, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=0.0s)]
*  suspicious enough to warrant an investigation. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=6.7s)]
*  A couple was found dead Wednesday in their home just outside Santa Fe. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=9.9s)]
*  One of their dogs was also found dead. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=13.9s)]
*  Deputies responded after a maintenance worker found the door of the home open and called 911. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=16.54s)]
*  I think we just found two or one deceased person inside the house. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  Are they moving at all? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=28.3s)]
*  No, they're not moving. Just send somebody out here really quick. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=30.099999999999998s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Tom Hanson is following this for us from Santa Fe, New Mexico. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=34.2s)]
*  Tom, thanks for joining us. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=39.4s)]
*  First off, why are police calling the deaths suspicious in nature? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=41.2s)]
*  Well, because the circumstances, Michael, are suspicious. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=47.4s)]
*  There are a lot of unanswered questions here. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=50.0s)]
*  And what we have to do is we have to look at some of the reports that have been issued, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=52.3s)]
*  including the preliminary autopsy, which found no evidence of external trauma. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=55.7s)]
*  But police say their deaths are suspicious enough. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=61.0s)]
*  Gene and Betsy, their deaths are suspicious enough that they are going to continue investigating. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=64.5s)]
*  You know, looking at the affidavit here, that paints perhaps the clearest picture of the events that unfolded throughout the day [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=69.5s)]
*  when both bodies were discovered. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=77.5s)]
*  Officers entered the home, as you mentioned, with the door ajar. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=79.4s)]
*  They found Betsy first. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=83.30000000000001s)]
*  They found her in the bathroom, her head next to a space heater, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=85.1s)]
*  pills scattered across the countertop. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=89.1s)]
*  And then they found Gene in another room, also dead, and including a dog as well. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=92.6s)]
*  But two other dogs were found alive. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=100.89999999999999s)]
*  Now, what they have noticed in their investigation so far is that, for instance, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=103.8s)]
*  details like both of them were in sweatpants. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=109.69999999999999s)]
*  They noticed that they were in relaxed clothing, that this is believed to have happened somewhat abruptly. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=113.10000000000001s)]
*  But there is no evidence to suggest that there was a carbon monoxide leak, for instance, or a gas leak. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=121.7s)]
*  So there are a lot of unanswered questions here. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=127.4s)]
*  And we're going to be looking very closely for a more thorough autopsy to come out in order to determine a cause of death here, Michael. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=129.70000000000002s)]
*  What are we hearing from the Hackman family? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=137.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, they've come out with a statement, and I think we can put it up on the screen here just to show. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=142.0s)]
*  They say that they are devastated by the loss. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=147.8s)]
*  The children released the statement saying, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=151.0s)]
*  It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our father, Gene Hackman, and his wife Betsy. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=153.6s)]
*  He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=158.4s)]
*  But to us, he was always just dad and grandpa. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  We will miss him sorely and are devastated by the loss. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=165.5s)]
*  Now, I should also mention that longtime friend, former colleague Clint Eastwood, also came out. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=168.3s)]
*  And I'm paraphrasing here, but essentially said that there were very few actors that were better than Gene Hackman, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=176.0s)]
*  and that he is one of the great actors of the 20th century, Michael. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=182.4s)]
*  All right, so many unanswered questions. Tom Hanson, thanks for joining us. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-n3BGhwcoU&t=187.3s)]
