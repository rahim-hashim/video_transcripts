# Jimmy Carter's funeral highlights his impact as U.S. president
**CBS News:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE)
*  Major, what a service. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=0.0s)]
*  What were some of your main takeaways from today's ceremony? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=2.56s)]
*  First of all, when we laid arrest [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=8.24s)]
*  and memorialize an American president, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=10.32s)]
*  we're reminding ourselves of the process [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=12.68s)]
*  by which that person became president, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=14.58s)]
*  a national campaign that transfixed the country [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=17.1s)]
*  and the country made a decision to elect whomever it was [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=19.56s)]
*  to occupy the office of the presidency. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=22.44s)]
*  And even if that, as in the case of Jimmy Carter's [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=24.48s)]
*  presidency is riddled by political turmoil, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  external events that sometimes appeared overwhelming [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=29.96s)]
*  and that president isn't reelected, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=32.72s)]
*  upon their death, we reevaluate not only the life [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=34.82s)]
*  that they led before the presidency, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=38.0s)]
*  during the presidency and afterwards, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=39.68s)]
*  but what that presidency meant in the moment to our country. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=41.24s)]
*  And the reflections now on the Jimmy Carter presidency [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=44.84s)]
*  got quite a bit of notice in the eulogies today, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=47.5s)]
*  saying yes, there were external events, inflation, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=50.84s)]
*  an oil embargo, a hostage crisis, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=53.88s)]
*  but there are also accomplishments, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=56.66s)]
*  things that maybe were not as well appreciated then, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=58.22s)]
*  but live with us today. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=61.22s)]
*  Jason Carter, the president's grandson, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=63.339999999999996s)]
*  said he was an early millennial [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=65.42s)]
*  because he influenced policy dealing with technology, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=67.44s)]
*  meaning he helped create the cable industry, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=71.74s)]
*  which led to streaming services, which led to cell phones. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=73.74s)]
*  He deregulated the airlines, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=76.78s)]
*  which led to low cost travel, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=78.25999999999999s)]
*  which we all take for granted now. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=79.98s)]
*  He created the modern shipping economy, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=81.82s)]
*  where Amazon and everything else [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=85.3s)]
*  is basically built into our daily lives [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=86.86s)]
*  because he deregulated trains and trucking in our country. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=89.22s)]
*  So those things live with us now [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=96.46s)]
*  because of Jimmy Carter's presidency. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=98.58s)]
*  I guarantee you, having read the history of that presidency [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=100.34s)]
*  and being old enough to remember it in my high school years, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=102.68s)]
*  got almost no notice at the time, almost none, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=105.56s)]
*  maybe a teeny bit. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=108.42s)]
*  So when we reappraise presidents at times like this, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=110.58s)]
*  we sort of go back and say, hey, what actually happened? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=113.28s)]
*  Is there something we missed [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=117.7s)]
*  or something that we should think about slightly differently? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=119.18s)]
*  That happened with George Herbert Walker Bush, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=121.6s)]
*  it happened with Gerald Ford. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=123.18s)]
*  And it looks like we lost Major. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=131.3s)]
*  The false. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=132.54s)]
*  Go ahead, Major, I'm sorry, there was a technical glitch. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=135.18s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=137.62s)]
*  The technical glitch is we are living with them ever, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=139.42000000000002s)]
*  constantly. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=142.62s)]
*  There is a sense in the short-term analysis [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=144.06s)]
*  of President Carter, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=147.02s)]
*  well, his post-presidency is the historic part. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=148.78s)]
*  Those who were closest to him say, no, no, no, not so fast. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=151.46s)]
*  The presidency mattered, the president was tested, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=154.78s)]
*  the president had lots of political ups and downs, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=157.26s)]
*  more downs than ups, but it still mattered. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=159.34s)]
*  And the fundamentals he brought to that office, honesty, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=161.98000000000002s)]
*  I will never tell you a lie, integrity, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=164.76s)]
*  not doing backroom deals, even with his own party, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=167.24s)]
*  congressional Democrats, which got him a lot of hostility [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=170.5s)]
*  within his own party, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=173.14s)]
*  putting aside an intra-party challenge from Ted Kennedy [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=174.89999999999998s)]
*  for the nomination in 1980, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  all things very difficult to balance, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=179.7s)]
*  all things very difficult to juggle. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=181.61999999999998s)]
*  He had a significant and relevant presidency. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=183.5s)]
*  That's also been part of the conversation, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=185.82s)]
*  not just today, but for the last two weeks. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=187.67999999999998s)]
*  So many poignant moments of the service today, Major. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=190.5s)]
*  The eulogies, though, by both the late President Gerald Ford [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=194.1s)]
*  and Carter's Vice President Walter Mondale, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=197.26s)]
*  bred by Ford's son, Stephen, and Mondale's son, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=199.26s)]
*  really stuck out to me. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=202.06s)]
*  And it really spoke to the friendship and love [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=203.86s)]
*  that these two men had for President Carter. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=206.94s)]
*  What was your reaction to those tributes? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=209.62s)]
*  That Jimmy Carter had a fierceness to him about politics. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=214.02s)]
*  You don't become governor of Georgia. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=218.62s)]
*  You don't, upon becoming governor of Georgia in 1970, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  looked at all the segregationists in your party [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=224.1s)]
*  and say the days of segregation are over, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=226.26s)]
*  shock them, appall them, anger them, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=228.58s)]
*  instantaneously about taking the office. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=230.54s)]
*  If you don't have a sense of courage, a sense of purpose, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=233.1s)]
*  you don't pursue the presidency when no one knows your name [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=235.67999999999998s)]
*  and no one in the Democratic Party takes you seriously, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=238.48s)]
*  win the nomination and win the presidency [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=240.64s)]
*  without that core set of fierceness and determination. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=242.72s)]
*  Jimmy Carter had all that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=246.29999999999998s)]
*  But he also had a kind of friendliness and openness [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=247.57999999999998s)]
*  and curiosity about people that transcended politics, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=251.29999999999998s)]
*  basically took away easy, reflexive, partisan differences [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=255.92s)]
*  and endured. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=261.71999999999997s)]
*  Gerald Ford's son spoke to that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=263.06s)]
*  Walter Mondale's son spoke to that. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=265.0s)]
*  And many people who have known Carter, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=266.96s)]
*  either as president or in his post-presidency, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=268.96s)]
*  said that he was more genuine [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=272.08s)]
*  than even they would have expected and more approachable, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=274.32s)]
*  more relatable than they would have expected. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=278.59999999999997s)]
*  Not a person of grandeur. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=281.41999999999996s)]
*  He wasn't in the office of the presidency [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=282.64s)]
*  and he wasn't after the presidency. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  And that's something that people found not only enticing, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=287.04s)]
*  but enduring and built long sustaining bonds, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  which not everyone does in politics. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  I can tell you that for certain. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=297.48s)]
*  Yes, definitely. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=299.16s)]
*  And Major, I wanna lean into something [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=300.48s)]
*  you brought up earlier in this conversation [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=302.24s)]
*  because so much of Carter's legacy really revolves [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=304.04s)]
*  around his life after he was in the White House. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=306.12s)]
*  He left Washington with a low approval rating. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=308.92s)]
*  But looking at our current political climate, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=311.74s)]
*  do you think history will perhaps look at his legacy [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  as president differently? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=317.36s)]
*  I think it will. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=321.12s)]
*  It always takes time. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=321.96s)]
*  It takes a long time. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=323.08s)]
*  And look, Jimmy Carter, twice in his presidency, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  once in 1978 and again in 1980, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=327.28s)]
*  had an approval rating of 26%. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=331.28s)]
*  That's a terribly low number. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=334.24s)]
*  So in the fierceness of the time in which he was president, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=336.46s)]
*  the American people turned away from him. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=340.28s)]
*  His presidency sometimes looked and felt very small [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=342.28s)]
*  as if he was overwhelmed by events. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=344.88s)]
*  There were articles written at the time [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=348.0s)]
*  about the ungovernability of America [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=350.05999999999995s)]
*  and how difficult things like inflation and interest rates [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=352.79999999999995s)]
*  and an oil embargo and the hostage crisis [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=355.91999999999996s)]
*  just made everyone feel as if things simply [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=358.67999999999995s)]
*  could not be brought into any semblance of order. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=361.34s)]
*  That all flowed toward the Carter presidency [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=364.96s)]
*  and was held against the Carter presidency very strongly. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=368.0s)]
*  That doesn't mean, even though that was [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=372.4s)]
*  the public perception widespread at the time, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=374.28s)]
*  that it was nothing but one failure after another. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=377.04s)]
*  The legislative accomplishments of the Carter presidency [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=379.84s)]
*  stand up pretty well. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=382.12s)]
*  Yes, he had large majorities of Democrats [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=383.16s)]
*  in the Senate and the House. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=386.2s)]
*  But remember, a lot of those were Southern Democrats [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=387.68s)]
*  who were not necessarily in every way [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=389.88s)]
*  comfortable with Jimmy Carter. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=392.08s)]
*  They thought in some respects he was too progressive, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=393.36s)]
*  too liberal, and didn't always align with him. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=395.9s)]
*  So that was a difficulty. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=399.7s)]
*  But as I mentioned before, when you [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=401.5s)]
*  look at deregulating the airlines, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=403.29999999999995s)]
*  trucking, telecommunications, even craft beer, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=405.02s)]
*  those are accomplishments. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=408.5s)]
*  His foreign policy, people think about the Soviet invasion [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=410.17999999999995s)]
*  of Afghanistan, and they think, well, Ronald Reagan [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=413.41999999999996s)]
*  must have helped defeat the Soviets. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=415.58s)]
*  No, Jimmy Carter was the first one [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=417.29999999999995s)]
*  to authorize covert assistance to the Mujahideen, which [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=418.73999999999995s)]
*  led to the defeat of the Soviets in Afghanistan. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=423.02s)]
*  Obviously, the Camp David peace accord, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=425.62s)]
*  an enormous accomplishment that still is with us today. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=427.46s)]
*  Egypt and Israel, every hour of every day, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=431.1s)]
*  are trying to figure out a way to get the hostages out [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=434.02s)]
*  from Gaza and resolve that long running war between Hamas [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=436.66s)]
*  and Israel because of the Camp David accords [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=441.0s)]
*  and the durability of that peace pact between Israel and Egypt. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=443.62s)]
*  President-elect Trump is talking about the Panama Canal. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=447.54s)]
*  Highly controversial at the time, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=450.26s)]
*  but Jimmy Carter thought it was enormously important [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=451.82s)]
*  for America to soften its Yankee imperialist image [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=454.12s)]
*  throughout South America and Central America, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=457.4s)]
*  turn the Panama Canal over to Panamanian control eventually. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=459.56s)]
*  That was a very hard fought political battle. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=463.12s)]
*  It proved to be one that he accomplished and won, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=465.12s)]
*  though the politics were demonstrably against him. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=468.04s)]
*  That has proved to be durable and is being revisited today, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=470.6s)]
*  not because the Panamanians are not handling the canal well. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=474.6s)]
*  It's because the Chinese have some interest in the ports [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=478.24s)]
*  on both ends of that canal. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=480.76s)]
*  That's a legitimate international policy issue, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=482.12s)]
*  but it's not the Panamanians' fault, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=484.48s)]
*  and it is certainly not Jimmy Carter's fault [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=486.04s)]
*  for creating a treaty by which control of that canal [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=488.2s)]
*  would eventually be given over to Panama. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=491.24s)]
*  All of those things were part of the Carter presidency. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=493.48s)]
*  If there's one constant thread to that presidency, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=495.64s)]
*  Jimmy Carter ignored the politics and pursued the policy. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=498.72s)]
*  Even when his closest advisors, including his wife, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=503.88s)]
*  Rosalynn, said, don't take this political risk now, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=506.32s)]
*  save it for later, Jimmy Carter's response [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=509.02s)]
*  as president always was, there might not be a later [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=511.9s)]
*  in which I can accomplish what I can accomplish now. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=514.5s)]
*  I will do it now. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=517.1s)]
*  Politics be damned. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=518.3s)]
*  Well, he damned the politics. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=519.9399999999999s)]
*  That came back to bite him. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=521.18s)]
*  That due his defeat in 1980, but it didn't mean [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=522.4599999999999s)]
*  he didn't accomplish a lot in the policy area. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=525.26s)]
*  Jimmy Carter was a remarkable person, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=528.4599999999999s)]
*  a remarkable president. He leaves quite the legacy. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=530.22s)]
*  Major Garrett, thank you so much for taking the time with us, sir. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=532.8s)]
*  Thank you so much for your insight. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XAQwzNIPE&t=535.5799999999999s)]
