# More on Trump's birthright citizenship order, new jobs report data, more | CBS News 24/7
**CBS News:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc)
*  What a day it's been already taking notes in real time all eyes on the White House as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=0.0s)]
*  President Donald Trump and the Japanese Prime Minister go head to head on dollars and defense. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Big questions loom at this hour, not the least of which could President Trump change the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=17.64s)]
*  course for Japan's Nippon Steels blocked bid to buy US Steel. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=22.0s)]
*  I'm Reid Cowen. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  Welcome in. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  As the two leaders step in front of a podium for a joint news conference, you'll see it [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=29.08s)]
*  right here on CBS News 24 seven. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=32.48s)]
*  It is one we are waiting for. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=34.64s)]
*  So think about it like this. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=35.92s)]
*  What's in the meeting of a Shibas Japan and what's in the meeting for Trump's vision for [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  America? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=42.76s)]
*  This we know Mr. Shiba has been hunkered down with his advisors for a week, preparing for [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=44.04s)]
*  that very big meeting. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  We're talking about strategy, the big issues, how much Japan pays for its own defense and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=49.72s)]
*  What more can Donald Trump squeeze out of Japan to get that nation to pay more for its [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  own security? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=60.6s)]
*  So here's what the president had to say just a moment ago. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=61.6s)]
*  We will be discussing North Korea and many other things. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=65.04s)]
*  I will be spending pretty much today. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=68.80000000000001s)]
*  But that's always a topic. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=72.28s)]
*  Mr. President, have you changed your mind about the sale of US Steel? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=73.28s)]
*  No, I think we're going to be discussing that today. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=77.28s)]
*  No, I haven't. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=80.72s)]
*  And I hear we'll have some pretty good information on that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=81.72s)]
*  That's our Ouija Jang asking that question. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  CBS News Chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes joining us now. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=87.48s)]
*  All eyes on that US Steel bid. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=90.72s)]
*  We know that President Biden put his foot in the door and said no. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  It looked at the time like President Donald Trump was with Biden on that, which is sort [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=95.88000000000001s)]
*  of rare, right? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=100.94000000000001s)]
*  But now it seems like there's a little bit of an opening, Nancy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump is always somebody who likes to make a deal. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  So let's see what the prime minister of Japan has to offer him in that meeting that is [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=110.58s)]
*  going on right now, Reid. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=115.82s)]
*  He has argued that steel is something that is so important to be made in the United States [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=118.25999999999999s)]
*  by US companies. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=123.9s)]
*  But US Steel itself has argued that it is going to have to lay off American workers [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=125.86s)]
*  if they don't get this all-important cash infusion from Nippon Steel, a Japanese company. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=130.66s)]
*  So the fact that President Trump told Ouija there that it's still up for discussion is [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=137.1s)]
*  really notable. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=144.22s)]
*  It is notable, especially given the fact that we have a president who was just voted in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  overwhelmingly by Americans on an America First agenda. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=149.85999999999999s)]
*  Do you think those layoffs is how he's going to, if this does get through and we don't [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=154.14s)]
*  know that it's going to get through, is how he's going to have to sell it to the American [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=157.82s)]
*  public? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=160.57999999999998s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=161.57999999999998s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=163.58s)]
*  And this is one of these issues where I think the American public is split just like folks [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=164.58s)]
*  in the steel industry are split. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=168.38000000000002s)]
*  There are union members who actually support the deal and having the Japanese come in and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=169.9s)]
*  take over US Steel. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=176.62s)]
*  They say that's the only way they're going to be able to keep their jobs and actually [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=177.78s)]
*  see the company grow. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=181.70000000000002s)]
*  And so this is not a cut and dried issue that has to do with sending US jobs overseas. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=183.26000000000002s)]
*  In fact, quite the opposite. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=190.14000000000001s)]
*  There has been this really compelling case made that actually bringing in foreign investment [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=192.12s)]
*  would increase American jobs. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  So we'll see if the president is willing to move on that at all over the course of this [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=199.04s)]
*  meeting. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=204.28s)]
*  He's going to be holding a press conference with the Japanese prime minister afterwards, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=205.28s)]
*  and I'm sure he'll get asked about it again. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=209.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=211.0s)]
*  And you know, we know that US Steel is not the only game piece on the board, so to speak. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=212.0s)]
*  There's also the discussion of trying to get Japan to increase the amount of money that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  they put forward for their own defense. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=220.17999999999998s)]
*  Any any thought there that Japan may move on this to increase the percentage based on [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=222.14s)]
*  their gross domestic product? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=227.22s)]
*  They may have to because what President Trump is likely to do with Japan is something that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=230.98s)]
*  he's been doing with other countries, which is threatening tariffs if they don't do what [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=235.14s)]
*  he wants. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=239.54s)]
*  It's part of the reason that he is threatening European countries with tariffs. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=240.94s)]
*  He has always believed, for example, he just brought it up there again in the Oval Office, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=244.73999999999998s)]
*  that European countries need to contribute more to NATO. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=248.26s)]
*  They did do that during his first term, but apparently not enough for President Trump. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=252.66s)]
*  And so it's not surprising that that is a line item on the list of things to be discussed [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=257.53999999999996s)]
*  in the Oval Office today. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=264.18s)]
*  They'll also be talking, Reed, about China. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=265.78s)]
*  This is something that both Japan and the US share concerns about Chinese influence [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=269.09999999999997s)]
*  in the region. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=275.21999999999997s)]
*  The US, as you know, has already gone ahead and slapped some tariffs, new tariffs on [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=276.90000000000003s)]
*  Chinese goods, and the Chinese have retaliated. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=281.90000000000003s)]
*  And that creates concerns for other countries in the region who worry that if there's a [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=284.70000000000005s)]
*  trade war, that that will mean higher prices for them as well. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=288.46000000000004s)]
*  So we're likely to hear coming out of that meeting more about that topic, too. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=293.22s)]
*  We know that you will be there and bring us those reports as soon as they step out. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=298.5s)]
*  Nancy Kord is always great to talk to you on a Friday or any day there from the White [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=301.82000000000005s)]
*  House. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=305.42s)]
*  Let's turn now to breaking news from the FBI after the Department of Justice demanded [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=306.42s)]
*  a list of agents who investigated those January 6 cases. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=310.3s)]
*  So you know this, FBI agents, they sued, they were worried about their privacy, worried [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=313.3s)]
*  about safety concerns. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=317.86s)]
*  We have an update at this hour, the US government agreeing in court to not release that list [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=319.66s)]
*  of names. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=324.26s)]
*  So that is a little bit of a relief, but that agreement is not long lasting. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=325.26s)]
*  It's only temporary, we're told. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=330.34000000000003s)]
*  So in the interim, CBS News correspondent Scott McFarland found that the Bureau is in [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=332.26s)]
*  turmoil. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=336.74s)]
*  Here is his interview with an agent whose name is reportedly on that list. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=337.74s)]
*  Listen. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=341.86s)]
*  The largest criminal investigation in FBI history has given way to potentially its largest [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=342.86s)]
*  crisis. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=348.58s)]
*  Do you think this is a distraction? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=349.58s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=351.58s)]
*  I personally, I've lost sleep over this. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=352.58s)]
*  This agent who helped arrest January 6 rioters fears retaliation from new leadership of [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=356.94s)]
*  the Justice Department for speaking with CBS News. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=362.1s)]
*  We just have a lot of unknowns and it feels like no one has our backs. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=365.5s)]
*  Trump allies at the Justice Department ordered the FBI to send a questionnaire nationwide [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=369.70000000000005s)]
*  to identify the personnel who investigated January 6 and make a list for leadership to [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=374.34000000000003s)]
*  review. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=379.90000000000003s)]
*  The agent is one of approximately 5,000 names on that list. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=380.90000000000003s)]
*  What was it like filling out that questionnaire? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=384.54s)]
*  Saying what you did and when you did it? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=390.22s)]
*  Really demoralizing. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=393.18s)]
*  Defeated. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=394.18s)]
*  We all feel defeated. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=395.18s)]
*  And really for nothing. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=398.18s)]
*  The scrutiny and storm cloud hovering over FBI employees over their work on cases that [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=400.82000000000005s)]
*  yielded more than 1,000 guilty pleas and a 100% conviction rate in jury trials sends [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=405.82000000000005s)]
*  a chilling message, the agent warns. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=411.42s)]
*  Moving forward, do we pick and choose? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=413.82000000000005s)]
*  Are we allowed to pick and choose what we feel comfortable? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=415.70000000000005s)]
*  Do you think this might scare people off taking certain cases in the future? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=419.9s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=423.5s)]
*  I mean, we're all humans. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=424.5s)]
*  Agents who testified or signed their names to public court documents worry of retaliation [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=427.5s)]
*  from riot defendants. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=432.26s)]
*  Keep the fight, fight, fight, fight. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=433.74s)]
*  Or their sympathizers. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=438.5s)]
*  It almost as if these defendants that were all pardoned have been put on a pedestal of [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=439.5s)]
*  being more patriotic and more loyal to this country than the men and women who go out [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=445.34s)]
*  every single day away from their families and put their lives on the line. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=451.61999999999995s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=456.61999999999995s)]
*  I really am at a loss for words. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=457.62s)]
*  It hurts. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=462.05999999999995s)]
*  We'll say that. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=463.05999999999995s)]
*  It hurts. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=464.05999999999995s)]
*  A Justice Department official in a memo to the FBI earlier this week wrote that agents [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=465.05999999999995s)]
*  who are simply following orders or carried out their duties in an ethical manner will [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=468.9s)]
*  not be subject to discipline. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=473.62s)]
*  But the agents and their attorneys tell CBS News they're not convinced. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=475.38s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=480.98s)]
*  Scott McFarland there. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=481.98s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=482.98s)]
*  When we come back, we continue to have all eyes and all monitors on the White House. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=483.98s)]
*  What will happen when the prime minister of Japan comes out and talks with the president [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=488.1s)]
*  of the United States? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=493.46s)]
*  What's the future of U.S. steel? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=495.58s)]
*  We're going to have that conversation and what it means to your wallet when we come [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=497.74s)]
*  back. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=500.5s)]
*  Welcome back to CBS News 24-7. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=503.62s)]
*  Let's talk jobs. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=508.42s)]
*  The January jobs report reveals new numbers on employment. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=509.42s)]
*  And economists say the data is weaker than expected. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=513.14s)]
*  The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the U.S. added 143,000 jobs last month. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=516.26s)]
*  That's lower than projected. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=521.1s)]
*  But at the same time, the unemployment rate edged down slightly from 4.1 percent in December [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=522.26s)]
*  to 4.4 percent in January. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=528.14s)]
*  Let's go live to CBS News Money Watch correspondent Kelly O'Grady. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=530.94s)]
*  Kelly, what do you make of today's job report? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=534.58s)]
*  Obviously, with a new administration, all eyes are on this early performance indicator. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=536.7800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so look, I would say things are in a decent spot, but we are slowing down. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=541.1s)]
*  Now, I do want to highlight this is for all of January, so the new administration can [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=548.1800000000001s)]
*  only really take credit for the back half of the report. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=553.1400000000001s)]
*  It's an early indication of the health of the labor market that the Trump administration [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=557.26s)]
*  is going to be dealing with. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=562.4200000000001s)]
*  We do know that people are taking longer and longer to find jobs when they are out of work. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=563.5400000000001s)]
*  And so when you see a lower number in terms of the openings, which came in versus what [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=569.98s)]
*  we were expecting, that's where you start to say, OK, things are slowing down. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=576.1s)]
*  The fact that that unemployment rate number ticked down to 4.0 percent from 4.1 percent, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=579.98s)]
*  less people are quitting, less people are moving away from those jobs. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=585.9s)]
*  So like I said, we're in a decent spot, but we are slowing down. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=589.66s)]
*  Well, we know one thing tends to affect the other. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=592.9399999999999s)]
*  And of course, the big thing, the elephant in the room is inflation. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=595.3s)]
*  Everybody wanting to get that down because then that affects interest rates, et cetera. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=599.06s)]
*  How does the jobs report really reflect inflation changes or does it? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=602.4599999999999s)]
*  So the really good news about this jobs report is that wages picked up in terms of the income [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=608.9s)]
*  increase in your salary. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=615.9s)]
*  So that increased from 3.9 percent annually to 4.1 percent. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=617.0600000000001s)]
*  The very good news about that 4.1 percent is that it's significantly higher where inflation [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=622.0600000000001s)]
*  stands right around 2.7 to 2.9 percent, depending on what index you're looking at. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=626.54s)]
*  We want to see continued months where that happens because when your wages grow, that's [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=632.22s)]
*  when you feel some of that relief in your pocketbook. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=637.94s)]
*  But again, it takes months and months and sometimes years of that to happen given how [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=640.82s)]
*  high inflation was. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=643.86s)]
*  What my takeaway is in terms of how the jobs report and the inflation are interacting is [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=645.72s)]
*  that we are not getting an interest rate cut when the Federal Reserve meets at the end [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=650.1600000000001s)]
*  of March. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=653.96s)]
*  The Fed always looks at where the labor market is and where inflation is. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=654.96s)]
*  And the fact that you are seeing inflation continue to tick up right now and you are [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=658.48s)]
*  seeing the labor market remain in a good spot and that unemployment rate actually come down [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=662.0s)]
*  indicates that there is not the case right now for an interest rate cut. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=667.64s)]
*  So we would likely expect them to hold steady. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=671.5600000000001s)]
*  Even if you get a front row seat, Kelly, even if you're there in March and there's a front [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=674.3s)]
*  row seat, no cut, what gives on a Friday? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=677.54s)]
*  Kelly, okay. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=681.0999999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much, my friend. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=682.0999999999999s)]
*  We'd rather have the truth, right? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=687.4599999999999s)]
*  So in the midst of so many questions about President Trump saying the U.S. would take [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=689.02s)]
*  over the Gaza Strip, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=692.14s)]
*  met at the Capitol today. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=696.6999999999999s)]
*  So let's listen in to what came from that meeting. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=698.26s)]
*  Today we discussed the special partnership that we have between these two countries, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=701.86s)]
*  and I thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for his unrelenting commitment to making the region [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=705.02s)]
*  and the world a safer place amid really extraordinary challenges. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=709.94s)]
*  What Israel has done in the past seven months really is a testament to what can be accomplished [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=714.98s)]
*  when we do not let the enemy set the rules. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=718.86s)]
*  As Prime Minister Netanyahu said Tuesday at the White House, when our enemies see daylight [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=722.64s)]
*  between Israel and the United States, they will exploit it. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=726.86s)]
*  We all know that is true. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=730.6999999999999s)]
*  And that's why strong, decisive leadership is so crucial in this time. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=732.3s)]
*  President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu both understand that peace is secured through [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=737.14s)]
*  strength, not appeasement, and not by turning our backs on our allies. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=740.66s)]
*  I'm now completing the week which began with an extraordinary meeting with President Trump. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=745.78s)]
*  And under his leadership, the critical decisions that show his commitment and the American [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=752.3399999999999s)]
*  people's commitment to Israel have come to the fore instantly. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=759.62s)]
*  Firstly, he renewed immediately the supply of the weapons that had been stopped, which [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=762.7800000000001s)]
*  we need as we're fighting for our future, for our existence, and for the broader Middle [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=767.1s)]
*  East in a seven-front war. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=773.1s)]
*  He immediately released those weapons. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=775.14s)]
*  He issued yesterday these sanctions on this scandalous and corrupt organization, the ICC, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=776.7800000000001s)]
*  that threatens the right of all democracies to defend themselves by themselves. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=783.7s)]
*  He's done so many things in the interim, just in two weeks' space to do that. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=789.02s)]
*  I can't wait. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=792.46s)]
*  You'll be welcome in the red carpet. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=793.46s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=795.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=796.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=797.38s)]
*  All right, so a lot of handshaking there. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=798.38s)]
*  Welcome with the red carpet, right? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=802.86s)]
*  But let's go live to CBS News, Congressional Reporter Torian Smaltorian. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=804.22s)]
*  Really what I didn't hear there was a drill down and getting very specific on what President [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=808.1s)]
*  Trump said regarding the U.S. potentially taking over the Gaza Strip, statements that [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=812.9399999999999s)]
*  seemed to have some backing and support from Mr. Johnson. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=818.02s)]
*  Any particulars on that? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=822.22s)]
*  And we also saw subsequently the president walk back a potential timeline on if that [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=826.26s)]
*  would happen. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=831.5s)]
*  But I agree with you. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=832.5s)]
*  That was something that was absent from these conversations, according to folks in the room. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=833.62s)]
*  I talked to Senator Richard Blumenthal, who was a part of a bipartisan delegation that [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=837.66s)]
*  sat down with Netanyahu this week, and he said that wasn't even a part of the discussion. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=841.94s)]
*  He said there's no expectation that the U.S. would be a part of this redevelopment and [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=846.78s)]
*  would especially not be tasked with financing that great overhaul happening there in Gaza [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=851.42s)]
*  if this were to happen. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=858.22s)]
*  What we did see, though, in this press conference and the meeting that preceded it between Johnson [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=860.46s)]
*  and Netanyahu was a reaffirmation of sorts of the U.S.'s alliance with Israel. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=866.78s)]
*  Mr. Johnson also laid at the feet of President Trump the progress and success of the Hamas-Israel [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=873.5s)]
*  ceasefire deal, and they reaffirmed their hope to extend that ceasefire and ultimately [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=879.7s)]
*  peace in that region. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=887.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, and keep in mind, we're still in phase one of what is hopefully going to be two phases [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=888.0600000000001s)]
*  of the hostage release and ceasefire deal, so that's a very tenuous bubble to be on. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=893.02s)]
*  Let's switch gears also. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=897.82s)]
*  This morning, Speaker Johnson said that details on a new budget resolution could be released [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=898.82s)]
*  soon to help advance the president's agenda. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=903.06s)]
*  Keep in mind, Congress writes the checks, right? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=905.38s)]
*  So the Senate is also working on their own package, but are they on the same page? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=907.0999999999999s)]
*  That's unclear, and I should mention the reason why this press conference between, or this [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=914.66s)]
*  photo op, it wasn't really a press conference, they didn't take questions, between Netanyahu [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=919.7399999999999s)]
*  and Johnson happened today is because it was postponed from yesterday. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=924.42s)]
*  It was a five-hour long meeting with House members and the White House that ran long [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=927.6600000000001s)]
*  because of these intense conversations about how exactly to implement and allocate funding [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=933.38s)]
*  for the president's agenda. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=940.62s)]
*  We know that several members of the House conference met in Mar-a-Lago or met in Florida [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=942.86s)]
*  last week. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=948.5400000000001s)]
*  This week, Senate Republicans will be headed down to Florida to meet with the president [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=949.5400000000001s)]
*  to discuss exactly how they move forward with that. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=954.86s)]
*  Priorities don't necessarily seem to match. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=957.98s)]
*  A lot of Senate Republicans have said that they want to prioritize spending on energy, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=959.9399999999999s)]
*  the military, and a border wall. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=965.14s)]
*  Republicans have a long laundry list that they got from the president, including the [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=968.54s)]
*  2017 tax cuts and other items that the president has talked about on the campaign trail. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=973.3s)]
*  The goal here, though, is to get something done sooner than later as they're looking [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=979.8199999999999s)]
*  to utilize the budget reconciliation process. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=983.9s)]
*  They also, though, have to address the debt limit that was pushed off, that was a part [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=987.3s)]
*  of the initial negotiations and the government funding deal that happened before President [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=991.98s)]
*  Trump took office that ultimately wasn't included. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=997.9s)]
*  That will have to be a significant piece of this conversation. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1000.98s)]
*  And correct me if I'm wrong, March 13th, that's the deadline, March 14th? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1004.38s)]
*  Mid-March, okay. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1009.42s)]
*  March 14th to avoid a government shutdown. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1010.42s)]
*  The Senate just confirmed Russell Vote. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1013.22s)]
*  He's the White House budget director. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1014.82s)]
*  How is policy expected to change under his leadership? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1016.5s)]
*  Well, Democrats are warning that this is the most dangerous confirmation Senate Republicans [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1019.5s)]
*  have pushed through yet. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1025.58s)]
*  They're noting that he is an architect, or known as an architect, of Project 2025. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1026.82s)]
*  And as Trump's budget chief, he would essentially allow, in their words, Trump unfettered access [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1033.06s)]
*  to dismantling the federal government as we know it. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1038.38s)]
*  This comes after Trump, before he was even confirmed, went ahead and signed quite a few [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1042.6999999999998s)]
*  executive orders that reformatted a lot of organizations that also include significant [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1046.62s)]
*  staffing cuts to several federal departments. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1052.6999999999998s)]
*  That's something that they're saying the American people should be concerned with. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1056.06s)]
*  I should also note, though, as part of this confirmation process, we've seen fewer and [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1059.3799999999999s)]
*  fewer Republicans defect from Trump's will on these more controversial picks. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1063.9399999999998s)]
*  Pete Hexeth saw only three Republicans defect there since then. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1069.5s)]
*  Russell Vote hasn't seen as much pushback. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1073.98s)]
*  Democrats recognize this. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1079.46s)]
*  So they're saying they're going to stall these processes, not necessarily because they believe [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1080.46s)]
*  they could change Republicans' mind, but they want to broadcast to the American public that [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1084.3799999999999s)]
*  these are the people that Trump's putting up to control the government, essentially, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1089.46s)]
*  and they want to make sure that they know that this is the wrong direction for America [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1093.72s)]
*  to go down. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1097.3799999999999s)]
*  OK, so speaking of confirmations, we're looking into next week. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1098.46s)]
*  We're at Friday now. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1101.8600000000001s)]
*  The Senate will vote to confirm whether Trump's two most embattled cabinet picks get through. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1102.8600000000001s)]
*  We're talking, of course, about Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence and [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1107.0600000000002s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of health and human services. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1111.3400000000001s)]
*  What can we expect from those votes? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1114.5s)]
*  Are we seeing a trend there as well going into next week? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1115.7800000000002s)]
*  Reid, the math is math-ing for them. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1120.7800000000002s)]
*  There are not as many Republicans who have reservations about them. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1123.66s)]
*  Some of the ones we were watching, for example, like Todd Young of Indiana, who had some questions [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1129.26s)]
*  about Tulsi Gabbard's effectiveness in the role. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1134.22s)]
*  He faced significant pushback from folks in Trump's world, and this intense pressure campaign [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1138.02s)]
*  has been pretty significant. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1143.3s)]
*  JD Vance, the vice president, has also served as a power broker of sorts, coming to the [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1144.9s)]
*  hill talking to these Republicans who have been on the fence. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1150.6999999999998s)]
*  It's ultimately been effective in pushing through these members. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1152.9799999999998s)]
*  Again, the numbers just aren't in the Democrats' favor here. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1155.8999999999999s)]
*  If they can't get four Republicans to vote against the party, then it's likely we'll [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1159.02s)]
*  see these two especially breeze through their confirmations next week. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1164.82s)]
*  Yeah, we keep hearing from Democrats those words, four principled Republicans, and you're [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1169.82s)]
*  yet to see them get what they are hoping for. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1174.78s)]
*  Nice to talk to you, Torian. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1177.86s)]
*  Well, you have a great Friday. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1178.86s)]
*  We appreciate the update. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1180.06s)]
*  Well, let's move on to this. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1181.3s)]
*  Crews in Alaska searching right now for a small plane missing with 10 people on board. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1182.86s)]
*  That regional airline flight taking off yesterday afternoon in western Alaska. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1187.4599999999998s)]
*  Still, at this hour, no word on any of their identities, but the disappearance, keeping [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1192.3799999999999s)]
*  track, marks the third major U.S. aviation incident in about a week. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1197.62s)]
*  We're talking about the crash of that Medevac jet in Philadelphia and then the helicopter [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1202.06s)]
*  in plane crash near D.C. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1206.1s)]
*  From a plane crash in Alaska to one in Brazil, look at the upper right part of your screen. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1208.9399999999998s)]
*  This is a traffic camera's view catching a moment that a small plane went down on a busy [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1213.3s)]
*  street in Sao Paulo. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1219.3999999999999s)]
*  That crash killed the two sole people aboard that aircraft. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1221.58s)]
*  We're talking about the pilot and the passenger. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1225.62s)]
*  A lot of residents with cameras caught this incident, posted it on social media. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1228.1s)]
*  Look at the aftermath there. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1232.4599999999998s)]
*  The entire crew on the scene said it wasn't really clear if that plane was attempting [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1233.78s)]
*  to make some sort of an emergency landing after taking off, but you see the results [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1236.8600000000001s)]
*  there. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1241.7s)]
*  It slid hundreds of meters and then hit a bus before it exploded. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1242.7s)]
*  We don't know the fate of the people on the bus, but we're asking that question as well. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1246.66s)]
*  We have our international cameras poised on that story. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1250.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, the National Weather Service confirmed two tornadoes touched down in eastern Tennessee [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1252.5800000000002s)]
*  last night. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1256.74s)]
*  This is in Morgan County. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1257.74s)]
*  It's about two hours east of Nashville. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1259.5s)]
*  And let's go a little closer. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1262.0800000000002s)]
*  This is a look at the aftermath. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1263.1s)]
*  Two people killed here. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1264.86s)]
*  Officials say the victims were mother and daughter, both of them from the same household. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1265.86s)]
*  In fact, at least three others are also injured here. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1270.4599999999998s)]
*  The damage prompted schools in that area to close today just to be very careful. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1273.34s)]
*  Look at those ominous skies. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1277.1s)]
*  Crews on the ground cleaning up the fallen debris and the trees that are littering that [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1278.98s)]
*  area. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1282.8999999999999s)]
*  Those tornadoes just can hit that fast, Jess. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1283.8999999999999s)]
*  And we continue to keep a close eye on that exact same community because right now they're [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1286.74s)]
*  gearing up for more ice storms and snow storms heading into this weekend's forecast just [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1290.14s)]
*  throughout the Midwest. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1294.5800000000002s)]
*  And so what happened last week, or actually earlier this week, the atmospheric river that [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1296.14s)]
*  impacted all the West Coast, that same system is now being drug along the states and it's [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1299.8200000000002s)]
*  bringing them more snow right around the corner. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1304.5400000000002s)]
*  I'm going to show you that right now on the map so you can kind of see this whole painted [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1306.42s)]
*  picture. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1309.7800000000002s)]
*  All throughout this week we were talking about heavy amounts of rain falling throughout California [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1311.18s)]
*  and the West Coast. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1315.46s)]
*  And now that exact same system, it's going to loop again and you'll see it. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1316.7800000000002s)]
*  And that's going to be that snowstorm that's pushing its way over Montana all throughout [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1319.94s)]
*  the Great Lakes, picking up some moisture from the south closer to Alabama and throughout [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1323.3s)]
*  the Carolinas. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1328.02s)]
*  And that's going to create some icy conditions for our friends right around the corner off [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1329.02s)]
*  closer to West Virginia where a lot of winter storm advisories are in effect right now. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1332.66s)]
*  That's that purple color you see behind me stretched all throughout those northern states [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1338.02s)]
*  too. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1341.3400000000001s)]
*  So take a look behind me. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1342.3400000000001s)]
*  I want to gear you up and get you ready to go when it comes to this strong storm. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1343.3400000000001s)]
*  We're expecting snowy conditions from Montana all the way over into Minnesota just throughout [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1345.94s)]
*  the afternoon hours for Friday. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1351.42s)]
*  That continues to track off closer to the Midwest. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1353.24s)]
*  We head all the way over into the Carolinas. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1356.4s)]
*  That's where that snow ice rain mix starts to occur as we head into this weekend's forecast, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1358.14s)]
*  making it challenging for travel and just hitting the highways, hitting the roads and [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1362.38s)]
*  airports too. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1366.8200000000002s)]
*  Ice accumulation can get close to around a hundredth of an inch, even more than that [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1368.42s)]
*  in certain communities just along those hills close to West Virginia and southern portions [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1371.5s)]
*  of Pennsylvania. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1375.74s)]
*  Now you take a look at the snow forecast. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1376.74s)]
*  This is impressive. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1378.3400000000001s)]
*  We can see up to around 10 inches of snow on the opposite end of the Great Lakes, a little [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1379.3400000000001s)]
*  bit less on the back end. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1383.5s)]
*  But you head all the way over into areas like upstate New York, places like Syracuse. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1384.5s)]
*  You get close to around 10 inches just within two days alone. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1388.42s)]
*  So it's going to be a snowy setup. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1391.7s)]
*  They're going to be packed in with all of that as we head into Saturday and Sunday. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1393.3400000000001s)]
*  And our friends just a little bit more south. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1396.98s)]
*  Well, they're going to see plenty of rain. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1398.26s)]
*  So ice, snow, rain. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1401.06s)]
*  They're getting it all right now just after that devastating tornado happened too. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1402.74s)]
*  Okay, Jess, thank you so much. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1406.18s)]
*  All right. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1408.34s)]
*  Talking about executive orders by the president of the United States from orders to lawyers. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1409.5s)]
*  More arguments against that executive order regarding birthright citizenship challenges [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1415.14s)]
*  when we come back. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1419.42s)]
*  Welcome back, everybody. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1420.42s)]
*  So we've learned in a new court filing moments ago after days of resistance, the director [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1433.3400000000001s)]
*  of the FBI sent over the names and the information of FBI employees investigating January 6 cases [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1437.22s)]
*  to the Department of Justice last night. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1443.5s)]
*  However, both parties agreed to not publicly publish those names before the court has something [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1445.94s)]
*  to say about it. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1451.26s)]
*  So what does this mean? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1452.26s)]
*  We know who to ask. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1453.78s)]
*  CBS News contributor Jessica Levinson joining us now, Jessica, why are we even having this [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1454.78s)]
*  conversation? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1459.3400000000001s)]
*  It used to be that it was a given that we didn't release the names of people who protect [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1460.3400000000001s)]
*  and serve our nation. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1464.9s)]
*  What's changed? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1466.26s)]
*  What's changed is we have a new administration that's changing a lot. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1468.5s)]
*  I mean, you and I have talked about executive orders. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1471.46s)]
*  We'll talk about those. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1473.7s)]
*  And we have an administration who is changing the way we do business and is saying to the [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1476.06s)]
*  Department of Justice, ask for FBI agents to identify themselves if they worked on [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1481.26s)]
*  January 6. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1486.46s)]
*  We know one of the president's very first things that he did once he was sworn in again [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1487.94s)]
*  was to pardon everybody who had been convicted or pleaded guilty regarding the events of [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1492.26s)]
*  And now he's seeking to find out which members of the FBI worked on that case. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1498.38s)]
*  As you said very clearly, the parties have come to at least a temporary agreement, meaning [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1504.5s)]
*  don't disseminate the names of these FBI agents unless you either give two days and allow [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1509.5s)]
*  them to fight it or you just want to wait until the next hearing in this case, because [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1516.2600000000002s)]
*  there will be more hearings in this case. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1522.5s)]
*  And we understand that this is only a temporary reprieve for those FBI agents who are worried [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1524.74s)]
*  that their names could get out and that they could be vulnerable to retaliation by those [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1528.46s)]
*  who not only in this January 6 case, but in other cases, they've been involved in prosecuting. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1533.46s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1538.26s)]
*  And that's what the judge, I believe, will consider. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1540.02s)]
*  So at this point, what we're doing is we're taking the temporary restraining order hearing [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1542.78s)]
*  off the table because the parties have come to a temporary agreement. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1547.0600000000002s)]
*  Sometime next month, I believe in March, there will be a hearing on something called [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1551.82s)]
*  a preliminary injunction. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1555.54s)]
*  And the same arguments will come up. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1557.74s)]
*  And the arguments will be FBI agents saying, I fear for my safety, I fear for the safety [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1560.5s)]
*  of my family, and will essentially ask, what is the purpose behind allowing anything other [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1566.3s)]
*  than my employee identification ever to become public in the sense of why would this information [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1574.02s)]
*  ever need to be disseminated to the public at large? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1580.44s)]
*  There will be arguments and then a judge will make a decision. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1584.0400000000002s)]
*  Be fascinating to watch that. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1588.2800000000002s)]
*  Let's pivot now to this conversation and regarding President Trump's executive orders on birthright [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1589.72s)]
*  citizenship. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1594.0800000000002s)]
*  We've now seen two court rulings. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1595.0800000000002s)]
*  Appeals are in process, but there's also a hearing going on in Boston. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1597.0400000000002s)]
*  Tell us what you know about that. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1601.0800000000002s)]
*  So we know that it's basically the same arguments and arguments are I'm going to characterize [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1603.5600000000002s)]
*  them as arguments to uphold the executive order on the basis of a new interpretation [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1609.52s)]
*  of the 14th Amendment. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1618.04s)]
*  So we know that the executive order tries to essentially strip certain people of birthright [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1619.56s)]
*  citizenship. What is birthright citizenship? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1626.44s)]
*  It comes to us from Section three of the 14th Amendment. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1628.68s)]
*  And I believe that a good reading of the plain language of the 14th Amendment tells us if [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1632.04s)]
*  you're born in this country, it does not matter what the status of your parents are. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1638.04s)]
*  You are a citizen of this country. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1642.2s)]
*  The Supreme Court for over 100 years has adopted that interpretation. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1644.2s)]
*  And so what we see read in these various court hearings are, I think, efforts to try and [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1649.0s)]
*  get this case to the Supreme Court and try to get the Supreme Court to adopt another [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1655.1599999999999s)]
*  interpretation, because right now any lower court is bound by the Supreme Court's definitive [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1661.08s)]
*  interpretation of what the Constitution means. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1667.8s)]
*  And at this point, again, case law indicates that this executive order, in my view, just [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1670.52s)]
*  cannot stand. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1675.32s)]
*  Well, get to play it out to the Supreme Court then, given all of that precedent, if the [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1676.52s)]
*  Supreme Court were to side with Trump's position on this, that would be earth shaking. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1680.28s)]
*  It would be. That would be a completely different understanding of the 14th Amendment, again, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1685.6399999999999s)]
*  put into the Constitution after the Civil War and the Reconstruction era, in part to [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1692.12s)]
*  say to people who were formerly slaves or the children of slaves, you're born in this [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1697.56s)]
*  country, you're a citizen, it does not matter what status your parents have. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1701.32s)]
*  And so if the court were to go back and look at language in the 14th Amendment that talks [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1705.56s)]
*  about subject to the jurisdiction thereof, that you are born in this country and subject [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1712.04s)]
*  to this country's jurisdiction, if they were to reinterpret that to exclude people who [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1716.6799999999998s)]
*  have currently been included, that would be a huge change in the law and obviously [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1721.72s)]
*  would have deeply significant repercussions for people. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1728.04s)]
*  You speak of reinterpretation of constitutional language. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1731.4s)]
*  What other ramifications could happen, Jessica? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1734.84s)]
*  It will be definitely for the history books, no matter what. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1737.64s)]
*  So let's pivot and talk about USAID and attorneys and what they're moving relative to that. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1740.3600000000001s)]
*  USAID is literally on fumes now, down from what, 10,000 staffers to 600 essential staffers. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1745.48s)]
*  What's going on in the courts there? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1751.16s)]
*  So what's going on in the courts there are a couple of different things, but the main, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1753.5600000000002s)]
*  as I see it, the main legal argument that people need to know is that there is a Clinton-era [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1758.76s)]
*  statute from 1998, and it's a statute that helps us kind of define USAID and define its status. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1764.6000000000001s)]
*  And it said to President Clinton, if you want to try and do away with USAID, go ahead, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1775.5600000000002s)]
*  but you have 90 days. He said, I don't want to. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1780.84s)]
*  And in the statute, there's nothing that prospectively would allow a future president [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1783.9599999999998s)]
*  to make significant changes. I believe that there's a good legal argument that what we're [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1789.3999999999999s)]
*  seeing right now that essentially firing all of these workers, trying to put USAID [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1794.76s)]
*  under the State Department, that that under this Clinton-era statute we've been talking about [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1801.3999999999999s)]
*  would be viewed as a significant enough legal change that you would need Congress to bless it. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1806.52s)]
*  And so those are very briefly, I think, the biggest legal arguments when it comes to USAID [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1813.4s)]
*  and essentially trying to, for lack of a better word, kind of disseminate it without talking to [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1819.96s)]
*  Congress about actually ending that particular agency. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1825.72s)]
*  Well, as our CBS News legal contributor, as an attorney and as an educator, we know your [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1829.72s)]
*  students have no end in things to talk about these days. Jessica Levinson, good to talk to [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1834.12s)]
*  you, my friend. You have a good Friday. All right, let's talk about our Eye on America series. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1838.84s)]
*  CBS News, it is our commitment to hear your stories in your community. You know, we've seen [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1843.4799999999998s)]
*  President Trump sign dozens of those executive orders since coming back to the White House. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1848.76s)]
*  Case in point, what Jessica just talked about. One of them is aimed at cutting federal support [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1853.2399999999998s)]
*  for gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19. President Trump says his order, quote, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1858.04s)]
*  protects children from chemical and surgical mutilation. Close quote, those are his words. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1863.96s)]
*  The order also abards some insurance companies from funding this care that forces hospitals [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1869.8s)]
*  across the country to pause that gender-affirming care for minors. CBS News, Colorado's Sarah [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1875.4s)]
*  Horbaczewicz talks with one family who will no longer get those gender treatments. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1880.76s)]
*  So we're terrified. I can't get her out of the country and I can't get her care. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1885.48s)]
*  It seems like a death sentence to me. In Boulder, Colorado, Manny's family is caught in the middle [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1888.3600000000001s)]
*  of national politics. My child, just trying to get a good grade in biology now, you know, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1893.24s)]
*  and starting to see that the world is chipping away at, you know, just the basic things that [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1899.0s)]
*  make her happy. Manny's 16-year-old daughter is transgender and has been getting gender-affirming [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1903.32s)]
*  care for years, but that ends this month. We have enough time to maybe get one more shot. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1908.68s)]
*  Following President Trump's recent executive orders rolling back transgender protections, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1915.16s)]
*  Manny's insurance will no longer cover that care and local hospitals will no longer provide it. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1920.2s)]
*  The out-of-pocket cost is over $200,000, which we're willing to do. We'll take on the debt. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1926.44s)]
*  I have doctors that verify, you know, with writing that these are all treatments that we need to keep [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1931.16s)]
*  her alive and I can't do anything. So Manny and his family started packing to leave the country, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1936.6000000000001s)]
*  looking for political asylum elsewhere. I don't care. If it's a third world country, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1943.8s)]
*  they let me sleep in a box and keep my daughter safe. That's what I'm going to do. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1947.96s)]
*  Right before Trump took office, they applied for their passports, but his daughters never came in. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1953.48s)]
*  We got a letter. Do you want to confirm male or female as the gender marker? And of course, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1958.76s)]
*  we said yes, because that's how my daughter expresses herself. And then that's when things [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1965.24s)]
*  got locked up. The family then tried to change the passport gender to male so it matches the [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1969.56s)]
*  immutable biological classification, which is now required by President Trump's executive order. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1975.0s)]
*  But the passport is stuck in the system. Constitutionally, as an American citizen, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1981.16s)]
*  she's allowed to have one and there's no resources right now for us to be able to [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1985.64s)]
*  pursue any line forward, A, to get her to safety without a passport or B, to provide her care. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1992.6s)]
*  Those plane tickets are booked for Monday, but Manny doesn't know if they'll be on that flight. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=1997.96s)]
*  Parent, I hurt seeing her hurt, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2003.24s)]
*  but I can't imagine how she really hurts. I'm Sarah Horbakovich, CBS Colorado. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2008.9199999999998s)]
*  Sarah, thank you for that story. Okay, so when we see it, you see it. And we are starting to see [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2014.6s)]
*  some movement there. Those two podiums there at the White House, a joint news conference between [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2018.76s)]
*  the leader of Japan and the newly elected leader of the United States of America. What is the fate [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2023.32s)]
*  and future of those relationships, not the least of which the fate and future [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2028.76s)]
*  of U.S. Steel. You're watching CBS News 24 seven on a Friday. We're back in a moment. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2033.0s)]
*  Let's go to the state of Tennessee where a possible tornado killed two people and injured [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2044.68s)]
*  at least three others. Our CBS partners at WVLT staying on top of this for their viewers, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2048.28s)]
*  showcasing the power of the CBS family. Let's watch from their coverage earlier today. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2053.72s)]
*  What a difference from coming up here this morning when we drove up around five o'clock, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2058.44s)]
*  you know, pitch black. You couldn't see much going on. Quite a contrast to Sunbright. When [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2063.48s)]
*  the Sunbright tornado hit last year, you remember that was in the town of Sunbright. The building [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2068.44s)]
*  is right on the town square. You couldn't miss it when you came through. And the pitch black, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2072.7599999999998s)]
*  we were driving right down some of these roads and you couldn't really see. And now, you know, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2077.56s)]
*  some of that devastation once the light comes up and you really start to see what went through [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2081.16s)]
*  last time. I mean, there's a tree going right in the middle of that mobile home, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2085.24s)]
*  that white mobile home right in front of me. The size of some of these trees just flattened. It [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2088.9199999999996s)]
*  looks like it looks like a giant had just taken a step and just stepped perfectly in some of these [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2093.72s)]
*  spots. I can say from some of the damage that I've seen, we've also been near the part where [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2098.52s)]
*  where unfortunately a mother and daughter lost their life. Kind of the same scene over there. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2103.56s)]
*  We're going to head back over there in just a bit, but it's heartbreaking. So many different [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2109.0s)]
*  linemen crews out here. I number one that jumps out at me. You've got to get out here. You name [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2113.48s)]
*  the you name the national local state agency, any kind of electric company that is here in Oregon [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2120.52s)]
*  County, Scott County. They have all hands on deck. Crews were cleaning this up at 9 30. Once this [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2128.52s)]
*  through power poles moving through that have been replaced before the sun came up, people that had [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2135.2400000000002s)]
*  power lost power had it before the sun came back up, which is pretty miraculous. We're going to keep [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2140.52s)]
*  as we continue to learn more of it. Just folks right around on four wheelers with chainsaws going, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2148.44s)]
*  what can I do to help? Did you see someone that needed help? Did you see a road that needed cleared? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2152.44s)]
*  These men and women up here are getting to work and trying to get their county back into into a [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2156.92s)]
*  working order. At least get the roads open, get buildings, get these people out of buildings that [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2161.96s)]
*  need to be in home secure, things like that. So we're going to stay on the ground for the rest of [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2167.0s)]
*  the day while crews continue to do that here in Morgan County. CBS cameras fired up in Tennessee [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2171.64s)]
*  and also fired up right there in a place where they could probably use some warming. That looks [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2177.08s)]
*  like Yellowstone there, Jess, if I'm seeing some of that plume of steam coming up out of terra firma. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2182.12s)]
*  This is beautiful. Wyoming Yellowstone National Park, that winter storm bringing snow headed [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2188.68s)]
*  into the weekend, one of my favorite places on the planet. It's beautiful. And remember just a [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2193.96s)]
*  few days ago when San Francisco, California broke records for their rainfall totals, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2198.92s)]
*  that exact same atmospheric river that packed its punch into northern California is now delivering [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2204.2s)]
*  heavy amounts of snow all throughout those northern states from Wyoming over into the Dakotas, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2209.56s)]
*  Minnesota. And it's matching up actually with some warmer moisture sweeping in from the south as we [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2214.6s)]
*  head into the next 24 hours. And that's going to create an ice system that sweeps its way off into [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2220.04s)]
*  the east impacting areas like southern Pennsylvania all the way up into northern portions of West [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2224.52s)]
*  Virginia. It's going to be a very impactful storm, but I want to show you just behind me what's [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2230.36s)]
*  happening as we head all the way to the north. Areas like California, yeah, they got hit heavy [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2233.88s)]
*  with that atmospheric river delivering even more rain when it comes to that area of low pressure [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2238.2s)]
*  just to the north. It's kind of been pushing the system closer to Idaho, Montana, all the way [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2244.04s)]
*  throughout the Dakotas. Now there's winter storm advisories and warnings that are in effect [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2249.32s)]
*  throughout the evening hours tonight, and we're going to see that last until tomorrow too in [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2253.4s)]
*  certain communities as the snow forecast starts to really add up. Now throughout the Rockies, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2257.0800000000004s)]
*  it's really hit or miss when it comes to the peaks. Some of the more populated areas like Park City [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2261.88s)]
*  or Steamboat Springs are expected to see anywhere up to around five to six inches of snow, but it's [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2266.44s)]
*  those smaller communities closer to the higher peaks that can see anywhere up to around a foot [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2271.0s)]
*  from that exact same atmospheric river. And now, like I said, it matches up with a lot of moisture [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2275.48s)]
*  coming in from the south. That's going to bring in icy conditions off into the east heading into [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2279.4s)]
*  this weekend. Fred? All right, thank you so much. Super Bowl 59, just two days away. Are you ready? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2283.1600000000003s)]
*  Kickoff for the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles is on Sunday and CBS News reporter Katie [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2288.2000000000003s)]
*  Weiss is in New Orleans in the middle of all of the excitement. Katie Weiss. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2293.0s)]
*  Well, I'm standing outside the Caesar Superdome where workers have been going inside all [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2298.44s)]
*  throughout the morning to get everything prepped and squared away for the big game [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2302.92s)]
*  that's just two days away. Also, state police are gearing up their security measures as well. We got [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2307.4s)]
*  a behind the scenes tour of some of their new surveillance cameras. There's hundreds of new [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2313.48s)]
*  cameras around both the central business district here where the Superdome is located and in the [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2318.6800000000003s)]
*  city's iconic historic French Quarter where these cameras have some controversial AI technology, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2323.56s)]
*  but state police tell me that they're being used to really keep people safe not only for this [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2329.8s)]
*  weekend but into Mardi Gras as well. They're an important tool that even have thermo imaging [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2334.36s)]
*  technology. Some states in the western part of the country use them to help detect wildfires in [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2339.48s)]
*  their early stages. Now, in the meantime, fans are also getting very excited and prepped up for the [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2345.48s)]
*  big game. I've been talking with fans who are looking forward to not only the sporting event [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2350.6000000000004s)]
*  but also the Super Bowl halftime show. It's going to be an historic show because it will [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2355.88s)]
*  feature for the very first time a solo rap performance. So the question on everyone's minds [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2360.84s)]
*  now is will Kendrick Lamar sing his Not Like Us hit song? We will find out. It remains to be seen. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2366.2000000000003s)]
*  We'll send it back to you. All right, Katie, thank you so much. Well, how do you feel when [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2373.88s)]
*  you put one of those paper straws in your mouth? It's kind of, ugh, right? Could plastic straws make [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2378.12s)]
*  a comeback? What we're learning about a new executive order from the guy who likes Diet Coke, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2382.76s)]
*  President Donald Trump. We'll be back. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2388.6800000000003s)]
*  But when we see it, you see it, and we are looking right now. You see our live cameras [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2396.92s)]
*  at the White House. We are awaiting that joint news conference that we've been waiting for [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2401.1600000000003s)]
*  for more than an hour after President Donald Trump and the Prime Minister of Japan step out [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2404.84s)]
*  of what are going to be some pretty high-level meetings. So many things that sway the defense [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2410.44s)]
*  of Japan and how much Japan pays for that defense. President Donald Trump wanting to see Japan [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2416.04s)]
*  really double their commitment of their gross domestic product in funding the defense of Japan. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2422.04s)]
*  That's a message he's sending to all international nations, right? But also that much talked about [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2427.56s)]
*  attempt by Japanese steel company Nippon Steel to try to buy U.S. steel. What kind of concessions [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2433.56s)]
*  could happen? So we're watching for that. As soon as those two gentlemen step before that podium, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2439.0s)]
*  we will break to that on CBS News 24 seven. But earlier, the president touched on a number of [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2443.96s)]
*  other topics during a face-to-face meeting with the press, including this moment about a possible [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2448.84s)]
*  meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In fact, as early as next week. Listen. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2454.2s)]
*  We'll probably be talking to President Putin. I'd like to see that war end [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2460.76s)]
*  for one primary reason. They're killing so many people. You're losing millions of people [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2465.0s)]
*  on a battlefield. In this case, mostly the battlefield. You have [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2469.96s)]
*  eight or 900,000 Russian soldiers are dead or and very badly wounded. And the same thing with [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2474.6800000000003s)]
*  Ukraine. You have probably 700,000 with Ukraine. The numbers they gave are a little bit lower [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2481.4s)]
*  than that. But I believe those numbers aren't correct. I'd like to see it end just on a [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2486.52s)]
*  human basis. It's terrible what's going on. They have open fields with no protection. The only [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2492.52s)]
*  thing a bullet can hit is a human body and the human body dies as soon as it gets hit. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2498.6000000000004s)]
*  Now, I'd like to see that end. It's a ridiculous war. It would have never started if I were [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0TMMYYnrc&t=2503.8s)]
