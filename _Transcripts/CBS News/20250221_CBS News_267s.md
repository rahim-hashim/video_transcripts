# Waltz insists Zelesnkyy will sign Russia war deal as Trump appears to walk back comments
**CBS News:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o)
*  Well, the White House continues to defend its approach for negotiations with Russia [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=0.0s)]
*  to end the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=5.32s)]
*  Earlier today, National Security Advisor Michael Walz doubled down on the proposal set forth [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=10.92s)]
*  And a reminder for our viewers, that proposal to end the war involves U.S. access to Ukraine's [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=12.6s)]
*  reserves of rare earth minerals. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=17.68s)]
*  It's a deal President Volodymyr Zelensky said no way to. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=20.36s)]
*  Walz says the deal would benefit everybody, including Ukraine. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=24.96s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=28.12s)]
*  Look, here's the bottom line. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=29.68s)]
*  President Zelensky is going to sign that deal. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=32.84s)]
*  And you will see that in the very short term. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  And that is good for Ukraine. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  What better could you have for Ukraine than to be in an economic partnership with the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=41.72s)]
*  United States, number one? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=45.84s)]
*  What better could you have for Ukraine to stop the killing, number two? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=47.52s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=50.72s)]
*  We have an obligation to you all, the American taxpayer, to recoup the hundreds of billions [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=51.72s)]
*  of dollars that have been invested in this war. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=57.12s)]
*  CBS News White House reporter Willie James Inman joins us now for more. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=61.12s)]
*  So President Trump also spoke on Ukraine during a radio interview. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=64.36s)]
*  What was his stance there? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=68.6s)]
*  Hey there, Reid, good to be with you. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=72.08s)]
*  That's right. This radio interview with Fox News host Brian Kilmeade. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=73.32s)]
*  The president essentially said that Russia was the aggressor here, that Russia attacked Ukraine. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=76.8s)]
*  Now, this follows those tense back and forth moments between President Trump and the president [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=83.16s)]
*  of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelensky, where the president seemingly blames Ukraine for the aggression here. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=88.64s)]
*  Let's remember that Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=95.56s)]
*  Also, Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=99.44s)]
*  That has widely been rejected by not only the United States and other countries around the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=103.08s)]
*  world allied with the United States, but many others. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=109.16s)]
*  But President Trump trading these barbs with Zelensky and having some tense moments with him. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  He also talked about how he would speak with Zelensky over the phone, saying that he's not playing [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=117.4s)]
*  games with President Zelensky. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=123.04s)]
*  But he also touched on Gaza as well and said that his plan to basically, I'm quoting him here, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  turn Gaza into the Riviera of the Middle East was something that he pitched. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=131.32s)]
*  It's not necessarily something that he's forcing to sum up the president's words there. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=136.16s)]
*  But clearly, the president taking a step back from those tense words, he called Zelensky a dictator [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=141.72s)]
*  without elections earlier in the week. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=149.0s)]
*  And we have seen those tensions rise as both sides try to work out some type of situation where they [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  can come to an end for this conflict. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  The United States, of course, meeting with Russia and Saudi Arabia, mediating those [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=158.36s)]
*  conversations earlier in the week. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=163.08s)]
*  And the White House is presenting these peace talks as a two track plan. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  They're having conversations with the Ukrainians as well. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=168.56s)]
*  Keith Kellogg, in fact, in Ukraine, meeting with officials there. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=171.2s)]
*  So clearly, the White House perhaps looking to do a little bit of cleanup. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=174.92s)]
*  But President Trump always coming on the offensive with his words there. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  But in this case, seemingly backtracking what he said earlier in the week. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=183.24s)]
*  Well, that backtracking is also paired with that news out of Ukraine that Mr. Zelensky, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=187.76s)]
*  President Zelensky, felt like hope had been restored after meeting with Mr. Kellogg. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=192.88s)]
*  What's on the schedule for the rest of the day for the president? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=198.6s)]
*  Yeah, well, the president's meeting with governors from across the country, Democrats and Republicans. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=202.16s)]
*  We know that the pool, the press pool that follows the president when he makes remarks is in the East Room [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  catching those remarks. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=214.84s)]
*  Perhaps we'll see them live on our screens pretty soon. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=216.4s)]
*  But on top of that, he is set to swear in Howard Lutnick, the Commerce Secretary nominee as the Secretary of Commerce [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=220.16s)]
*  in the Oval Office today. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=227.6s)]
*  And that is typically an opportunity where us reporters have a chance to ask the president questions. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=228.84s)]
*  He has really been taking a lot of questions in those in those moments where there's a swearing in ceremony in the Oval [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=235.04s)]
*  Office and having an exchange with reporters. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  So perhaps we can have or see some more comments from the president. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=243.72s)]
*  And on the top of that read, he's set to sign executive orders. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=247.0s)]
*  It's unclear what those executive orders are, if they're executive orders, plural or an executive order. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=250.2s)]
*  But the White House has that on the schedule for now, but we don't have those details. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=254.68s)]
*  Of course, we'll bring them to you once we have them. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=259.52s)]
*  We know you do. Willie James Eamon, as always, out of the park. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=261.92s)]
*  Thank you so much, my friend. Good to talk to you on a Friday. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUD-c0fFE-o&t=264.8s)]
