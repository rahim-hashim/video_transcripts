The reverend said she doesn't consider Mr. Trump an enemy and believes they can disagree respectfully. The Rev.

# Pastor discusses Trump and bishop's interaction over immigration policies
**CBS News:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg)
*  The vast majority of immigrants are not criminals. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=0.0s)]
*  They pay taxes and are good neighbors. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=4.16s)]
*  I ask you to have mercy, Mr. President, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=7.68s)]
*  on those in our communities whose children fear [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=9.28s)]
*  that their parents will be taken away [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=12.56s)]
*  and that you help those who are fleeing war zones [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=15.48s)]
*  and persecution in their own lands. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=17.64s)]
*  This was a major moment. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=21.16s)]
*  The Episcopal Bishop of Washington [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=23.28s)]
*  making a direct appeal. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  You see him there to President Trump [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=26.76s)]
*  at a post inauguration prayer service Tuesday. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=28.639999999999997s)]
*  The bishop says she will continue to pray for Trump [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  after he lashed out at her, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  calling her a quote, radical left hardline Trump hater. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=36.32s)]
*  The Reverend said she doesn't consider Trump an enemy [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=40.16s)]
*  and believes they can disagree respectfully. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=42.32s)]
*  The Reverend Dr. K. Carpenter joins me now in Studio 57. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=45.64s)]
*  He's a senior pastor at St. Paul and St. Andrew [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=48.64s)]
*  United Methodist Church here in New York City. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=50.96s)]
*  Thank you for being here, especially so early. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=53.8s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=56.36s)]
*  What do you make of the remarks made by the bishop [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=57.32s)]
*  in the first place and Trump's response? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=61.16s)]
*  I was glad to hear the bishop speak up [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=64.32s)]
*  about something that many Christians [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=66.64s)]
*  and many people of other faiths are thinking about [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=69.08s)]
*  and worrying about at this point. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=72.8s)]
*  We're in work, we're doing work [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=75.76s)]
*  with our immigrant communities and families. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=79.44s)]
*  We have gotten to know people personally [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=82.36s)]
*  who have come to seek safety and refuge in this country. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=84.76s)]
*  And I was glad to hear her speak up and ask for mercy. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=89.2s)]
*  It was a very gentle approach, I thought, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=93.28s)]
*  but a very important one. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  We should note that your church, as you mentioned, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=98.44s)]
*  does outreach for immigrant communities. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=101.0s)]
*  It's a bedrock of what you do. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=103.88s)]
*  What then is your point of view on Trump's policies, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=106.72s)]
*  which now extend to places of worship? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=109.24s)]
*  What's your view on this, considering what the Bible [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=113.36s)]
*  teaches? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=115.16s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's unfortunate. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=115.96s)]
*  I think it shows a little bit of a lack of understanding, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  not only of Scripture, as you mentioned, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=121.36s)]
*  but of our Constitution, the separation of church and state. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=124.6s)]
*  What does Scripture say? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=129.28s)]
*  Scripture says, welcome the stranger. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  For you were a stranger once in a foreign land. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=133.4s)]
*  And Scripture says, welcome the stranger. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  Welcome the stranger once in a foreign land. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=139.88s)]
*  And Scripture talks about Jesus being a refugee, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  an asylum seeker, if you will, in Egypt. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  Shortly after his birth, his family had to grab him [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=149.24s)]
*  and take him to a foreign place for safety, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=151.84s)]
*  to get away from an oppressive regime that wanted to kill him. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  And you're here in New York City, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=160.08s)]
*  but not every faith leader is as fortunate when it comes [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=162.0s)]
*  to advocating for immigrant communities, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=164.88s)]
*  but also not breaking the law. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  How do you navigate that? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=168.92s)]
*  Is that something you're even concerned about? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=170.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think we're just doing what we've always done, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=171.92s)]
*  and we're going to continue doing what we've always done. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  We take our cue from the gospel. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=178.16s)]
*  We take our cue from Jesus, who was our spiritual leader, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  and the mandate to extend ourselves [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  to people who are afraid and people who are in need. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=187.83999999999997s)]
*  And so we'll continue to do that. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=192.16s)]
*  We're not trying to defy the law. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=194.27999999999997s)]
*  We're just trying to follow our religious principles. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=195.92s)]
*  And your advice to people who, similarly, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  want to follow the law but feel a religious calling [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=201.92s)]
*  to help those in need. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=206.44s)]
*  We know that there are things that, for instance, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=208.72s)]
*  ICE is able to do and things that they're not [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  supposed to do. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=214.6s)]
*  And so we're going to continue to ask if somebody comes [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=215.48s)]
*  for a judicial warrant. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=218.56s)]
*  This is just basic legalism. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  But more than that, we're just going [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=222.6s)]
*  to continue to serve the people who come to us [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=224.56s)]
*  and are in tremendous needs for them and their family, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=227.2s)]
*  for a place of safety. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  We come here for a different life, a safer life, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=232.52s)]
*  like my ancestors did. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=236.24s)]
*  It's an important reminder, Reverend Dr. K. Carpenter. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=238.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=241.08s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-idcs0wfg&t=242.44s)]
