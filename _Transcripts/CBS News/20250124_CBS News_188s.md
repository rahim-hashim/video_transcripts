# Senate set to hold final vote on Hegseth's confirmation as defense secretary
**CBS News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU)
*  OK, the Senate will vote today on the confirmation of the president's embattled pick for defense [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=0.0s)]
*  secretary Pete Hegseth. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=4.96s)]
*  The former Fox News host passed a procedural vote on Thursday despite two Republicans joining [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=6.28s)]
*  all the Democrats in opposition. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=11.08s)]
*  That started the clock on a maximum of 30 hours of debate, meaning the vote may not [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  happen until this evening. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=16.64s)]
*  CBS News political reporter Torian Small joins us now from Capitol Hill. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=18.32s)]
*  We just heard from Trump moments ago on Hegseth's confirmation. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=22.6s)]
*  What do you say, Tori? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=25.96s)]
*  Yeah, so he basically called out the usual suspects, right? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=27.2s)]
*  These are Trump skeptics, Vlad, not necessarily in line with the party when the orthodoxy [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=30.76s)]
*  here is to placate the president. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=35.96s)]
*  Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine are the two defectors in this case. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  They came out with their reservations about Hegseth moving forward and ultimately said [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=45.72s)]
*  when the time comes, they just can't vote for them. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  This is what President Trump had to say about that. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=53.92s)]
*  Look, whatever it is, it is. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=56.36s)]
*  He's a good man. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=57.68s)]
*  I don't know what's going to happen. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=58.52s)]
*  You never know in those things, but Pete's a very, very good man. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=60.04s)]
*  I hope he makes it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=64.08s)]
*  I hope he makes it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=65.44s)]
*  I was very surprised that Collins and Murkowski would do that. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=68.36s)]
*  And of course, Mitch is always a no vote, I guess. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=73.4s)]
*  Is Mitch a no vote? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=75.84s)]
*  How about Mitch? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=77.48s)]
*  You what? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=79.8s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=81.76s)]
*  It's interesting that he called out the former minority leader there, Mitch McConnell, even [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=84.52s)]
*  though he hasn't telegraphed where his vote lands just yet. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=89.24s)]
*  But I will say when it came to Collins and Murkowski, they had longstanding reservations [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  about Hegseth's ability to lead, but also this mounting controversy surrounding this [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  confirmation here, allegations of sexual misconduct, alcohol abuse on top of other things, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=106.08s)]
*  a myriad of allegations that I should mention Hegseth has denied. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=113.88s)]
*  But for those two senators, that's just too much for them to get behind. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=117.96s)]
*  Remind Torrey and our viewers, he's lost already two Republican votes. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=123.8s)]
*  How many more can he lose before his nomination fails? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  That margin is very small. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=131.68s)]
*  He can only afford to lose one more Republican senator in order for then J.D. Vance, the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=133.96s)]
*  in as the president of the Senate to cast that tie breaking vote. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=140.92s)]
*  If that happens, let's say Mitch McConnell, for example, decides to pull out. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  That means again that he will still be able to be approved. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=150.56s)]
*  Now if one other person decides to defect, his confirmation is essentially dead in the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  water. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  The only other senator that I'm watching at this point is Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=161.39999999999998s)]
*  So she was a part of the committee that voted him out of committee to send him to the floor [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=167.12s)]
*  for a vote. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=171.76s)]
*  She has previously been noncommittal and expressed some reservations about these allegations. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=173.52s)]
*  We'll be watching to see if she changes her vote. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=178.56s)]
*  So far it doesn't look like that's necessarily going to happen, Vlad. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=182.0s)]
*  All right, Torrey, it's small for us on the Hill this morning. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=185.28s)]
*  Thank you, Torrey. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibz1LlTPopU&t=187.24s)]
