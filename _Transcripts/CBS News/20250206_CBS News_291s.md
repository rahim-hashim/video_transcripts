# Hamas says it rejects Trump's Gaza plan, calls on all Palestinians to unite in opposition
**CBS News:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg)
*  All right, we're showing you pictures now of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=0.0s)]
*  on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=5.9s)]
*  He is set to meet with some GOP lawmakers later today, later this morning. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=7.44s)]
*  Obviously, we're keeping an eye out on those developments, given the news that the president [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  of the United States has made this week with his plans, the plans for the United States [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=17.04s)]
*  as it relates to Gaza. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  And now we're learning that Hamas has responded to the president's plans for the United States [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=22.72s)]
*  to take control of the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=27.0s)]
*  The group says it categorically rejects the idea, as you might imagine. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=28.8s)]
*  Now it's called on all Palestinians to unite in opposition that has raised concerns that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=32.28s)]
*  already the fragile ceasefire deal could be on even thinner ice. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=37.16s)]
*  CBS News national correspondent Ian Lee, who has spent multiple years covering the Middle [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=41.32s)]
*  East, is here in Studio 55 to talk to me about this. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=45.44s)]
*  It's good to see you here in New York. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=48.24s)]
*  Ian, as we've pointed out, you've spent many, many years covering the Middle East, going [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=49.88s)]
*  back to your time even before here at CBS. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=54.56s)]
*  Let me get your sense of the reaction of what people in the Palestinian territories might [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=57.44s)]
*  be saying in reaction to what the president is suggesting. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=63.76s)]
*  I think there's probably a lot of shock, Vlad, people hearing what the president said. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=66.92s)]
*  We haven't heard this from the U.S. government before, some proposal like this. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=72.08s)]
*  So there's a lot of shock in the West Bank and in Gaza, but also of digging in their [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=76.64s)]
*  heels. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=83.08s)]
*  People who are, many of them, descendants of families that fled in 1948 and 1967, their [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=84.08s)]
*  homes, they don't want to make 2025 another year in that list. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=89.84s)]
*  So there's going to be a lot of resistance to the president's plan. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=95.0s)]
*  The president has suggested that countries like Egypt and Jordan could take in the two [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=98.48s)]
*  million residents of the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=104.36s)]
*  Both of those countries have signaled that they, that's impossible, not just because [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=106.8s)]
*  it would present a huge economic burden and strain on their treasuries, but also they [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  wouldn't be able to know whether or not some of the people that were coming in were perhaps [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  potential terrorists. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=121.04s)]
*  I've lived in Egypt, I've lived in Jordan, I've been to those borders many times, and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=122.04s)]
*  I can tell you Egypt actually built the wall in its border fortifications during the war. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=126.68s)]
*  It doesn't want Gazans on the Sinai Peninsula. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=131.44s)]
*  Jordan doesn't. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=134.56s)]
*  They can't handle it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=135.56s)]
*  They don't want them. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=136.56s)]
*  This really does seem, though, like a non-starter. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=137.56s)]
*  I would be surprised if the White House and Israeli officials are really considering this. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=140.4s)]
*  It seems a bit shocking to most people, this kind of proposal, but it seems more to me [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=146.88s)]
*  like a negotiating tactic by the Trump administration, knock regional leaders off balance for future [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  negotiations when it comes to the Palestinians and the Israelis. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=160.0s)]
*  I would be very surprised if anyone in those in Israel or the White House is really taking [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  this consideration seriously. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=168.8s)]
*  I would tend to agree with you, Ian, except that you've heard Nancy Cordes in our segment [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=171.12s)]
*  earlier suggesting that there are some right-wing Israeli politicians who are in support of [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=177.16000000000003s)]
*  this. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=181.88000000000002s)]
*  We know that some of the right-wingers in Israel have long supported the state of Israel [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=182.88000000000002s)]
*  annexing the entire Gaza Strip, including even the West Bank. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=187.16000000000003s)]
*  We know that treaties would fall apart, treaties that exist between Israel and Egypt and Saudi [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=191.28s)]
*  Arabia. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=195.8s)]
*  Those would go by the wayside. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=196.8s)]
*  On one hand, I want to be optimistic like you and think to myself, this is just a bluff, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  this is just a tactic. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  On the other, if there are people who have had this wish for quite some time and now [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=205.26000000000002s)]
*  you've got the backing of the superpower, the United States, why wouldn't you do it? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=210.52s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  There is a section of Israeli society on the right that would like to see the Gazans leave [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=216.68s)]
*  the Gaza Strip, settlers move in. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  They are a very vocal and strong part of Prime Minister Netanyahu's coalition. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=224.32s)]
*  He needs them to stay in power and that's very important for him right now, especially [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=229.32s)]
*  as he has legal issues. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  But by and large, if you look at Gaza, it's approximately 1.8 million people. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=236.16s)]
*  They won't leave, so you'd have to do that by force. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=241.34s)]
*  Many legal scholars say that if you did that, that would be ethnic cleansing and it's just [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=244.6s)]
*  really a non-starter. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=249.12s)]
*  There are large vocal parts of Israeli society that doesn't want that to happen too. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=250.92s)]
*  So it does seem like it would be very difficult. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=256.76s)]
*  And I just keep thinking to myself that part of the rise of Osama bin Laden and that whole [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=259.96s)]
*  jihadist movement that happened in the late 80s up until 9-11 came about because they [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=264.76s)]
*  felt that Americans were intruding, having boots on the ground in places that they thought [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=270.06s)]
*  were sacred, where Americans should not be. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=274.24s)]
*  So even though the president is suggesting there won't be American boots on the ground, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=276.32s)]
*  as you say, it would be very hard to do without using force. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=279.32s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  All right, Ian Lee, so great to have you here for this context, man. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  Probably the best conversation I've had this week here in the studio. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=286.44s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=288.96s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for being here. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHiff61H2eg&t=289.96s)]
