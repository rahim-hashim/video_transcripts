# China imposes tariffs on U.S. goods as new round of Trump tariffs coming
**CBS News:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I)
*  Welcome back to CBS News 24 seven. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=0.0s)]
*  So let's go deeper on President Donald Trump's [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=2.34s)]
*  proposed tariffs today. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=4.34s)]
*  25% on all steel and aluminum imports [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=6.04s)]
*  into the United States, including from Canada and Mexico. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=8.84s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News business contributor, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=11.84s)]
*  Javier David. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=14.4s)]
*  Javier, nice to have you with us on the stream once again. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=15.44s)]
*  The president believes these tariffs [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=17.56s)]
*  will help US steel producers. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  What's the logic here? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=21.04s)]
*  Well, the logic is you're trying to prevent, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=22.7s)]
*  this is a long standing problem. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=25.96s)]
*  The idea that companies or countries rather, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=28.58s)]
*  will sort of quote unquote dump cheaper goods [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=31.979999999999997s)]
*  into the United States. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=35.54s)]
*  So the best way to avoid that is to make those goods [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=36.78s)]
*  more expensive and force US producers to use US made goods. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=41.379999999999995s)]
*  Now, the problem with that is these things that we get [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=46.58s)]
*  from overseas sometimes just are cheaper [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=50.68s)]
*  and more cost effective to import. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=52.739999999999995s)]
*  And using US steel or US made exclusively products [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=55.18s)]
*  is sometimes easier said than done. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=60.08s)]
*  So the president's idea is, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=62.14s)]
*  hey, let's make it more expensive for these countries [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=63.379999999999995s)]
*  to drop these things or these particular goods [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=66.06s)]
*  or services into our country. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=68.94s)]
*  And therefore will force American producers [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=70.74s)]
*  to do more with American goods. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=75.52s)]
*  Okay, so Trump also pledged to announce [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=78.42s)]
*  these so-called reciprocal tariffs this week. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=81.14s)]
*  We're hearing a lot about reciprocal tariffs. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=83.3s)]
*  So is it an oversimplification to say [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=85.82s)]
*  that a reciprocal tariff is essentially [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=88.02s)]
*  that if a country taxes us, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=90.17999999999999s)]
*  we just tax them right back the same amount. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=91.82s)]
*  And then I guess my larger question is, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=93.82s)]
*  how is this not a trade war? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=95.86s)]
*  Well, A, it is exactly what the name implies. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=97.94s)]
*  It's reciprocity. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=101.5s)]
*  If you charge us, we charge you and vice versa. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=102.66s)]
*  It is in fact, if not by name, certainly a trade war [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=106.38s)]
*  because basically the conflict is about [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=110.44s)]
*  what is coming in one country and what's going into another, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=113.44s)]
*  how much that costs and basically ultimately [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=116.48s)]
*  who pays the price. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=118.6s)]
*  And that is, I think ultimately what will happen [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=119.72s)]
*  is consumers will pay the price [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=122.32s)]
*  because companies that are going to be paying more [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=124.32s)]
*  will pass it along to them. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=126.4s)]
*  Okay, so when could consumers start seeing the impacts [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=128.16s)]
*  of this, whether good or bad? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=130.84s)]
*  Look, there's a lag. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=133.12s)]
*  It won't happen right away, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=134.52s)]
*  but I'd say within a month or so, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=136.12s)]
*  you will see certain goods getting more expensive. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=138.24s)]
*  I think the problem with this whole debate, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=142.84s)]
*  whether you wanna call it a trade war or a terrorist [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=145.28s)]
*  or reciprocity or whatever is, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=147.44s)]
*  it makes it really difficult for companies to plan [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  what they're going to charge [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=152.68s)]
*  and what they are willing to pay for certain things. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=154.08s)]
*  So they're gonna be scrambling, trying to figure it all out. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=156.32000000000002s)]
*  So at some point, the president might decide [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=159.18s)]
*  to change his mind and roll these tariffs back, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=161.12s)]
*  but the impact will already be felt in the system [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=163.46s)]
*  because companies will have to adjust [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=165.9s)]
*  and they will have to sort of account [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=169.2s)]
*  for what is going to cost them more [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=170.04s)]
*  and how much of that consumers are gonna be forced to eat. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=171.76s)]
*  Of course, China is such a huge player. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  So I wanna drill down on China just a little bit. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=176.48s)]
*  They hit back on Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=178.28s)]
*  with their own tariffs on US goods taking effect today. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=181.22s)]
*  A 15% tariff on all imports of US coal [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=185.56s)]
*  and liquefied natural gas. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=188.48s)]
*  What a 10% tariff on American crude oil, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=189.72s)]
*  agricultural machinery, large engine cars. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=192.57999999999998s)]
*  So before the election, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=195.12s)]
*  economists said that there could be a negative effect [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=197.48s)]
*  for the US consumer. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=200.04s)]
*  When you look at all of the China tariffs [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=201.04s)]
*  on US goods now in effect, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=203.56s)]
*  where do you think the rubber [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  is gonna really hit the road first in any of those sectors? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=207.0s)]
*  Primarily in the energy sector. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  You're probably going to be paying more at the pump. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=211.67999999999998s)]
*  You'll see it because there is the spike effect [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=214.6s)]
*  to the United States is this massive exporter of energy. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  Now we've really conflict the energy paradigm. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=221.92s)]
*  At the pump will be the biggest way to see it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=225.24s)]
*  And also like we're in winter. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  So we're using more natural gas [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=229.8s)]
*  to the extent that that is imported [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  that you'll see it there as well on your bills. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=234.3s)]
*  Okay, so as we watch dollars and cents, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  we are literally watching cents today. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=238.24s)]
*  Another headline here, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=240.44s)]
*  the president ordering the US treasury [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  to stop minting new pennies. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=243.72s)]
*  Walk us through the why here. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=245.4s)]
*  This has been a really big debate for a while. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=248.0s)]
*  So the short answer is it costs the US mint [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=251.0s)]
*  more to create pennies than it does [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=254.56s)]
*  to actually just disseminate the news them. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=256.84s)]
*  And in fact, the US mint lost almost $180 million [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=259.0s)]
*  in 2023 producing pennies. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=263.32s)]
*  And the big part of the reason why [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=265.2s)]
*  is we're more of a cash flow society. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  People aren't necessarily dealing in pennies. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=270.32s)]
*  When they get them, you toss them out [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=272.68s)]
*  because they don't really amount to anything. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=274.5s)]
*  Or you put them in a jar [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  and kind of save them for a rainy day [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=278.96s)]
*  as the graphic is showing. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=280.72s)]
*  So the idea is there's so little of it in circulation [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=282.6s)]
*  and people just throw them away [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=286.68s)]
*  or kind of stick them away or hoard them. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=288.64000000000004s)]
*  It doesn't really make a whole lot of sense [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=292.16s)]
*  to continue to pass this along. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  And we haven't even gotten into the fact [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  that what we used to make pennies [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=298.56s)]
*  is traded on open markets [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=301.1s)]
*  and those prices are more expensive, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=302.44s)]
*  the commodities market. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, and that also opened up the conversation [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=305.76000000000005s)]
*  that it's now more expensive to create a nickel [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=307.5s)]
*  than a nickel costs too. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=309.74s)]
*  Do you see that this could be the beginning [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=311.2s)]
*  of looking at currency in general? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=313.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it really does sort of argue [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=315.68s)]
*  whether or not we need to rethink the whole paradigm [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=319.24s)]
*  of what are dollars and cents? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  Are we gonna re-denominate certain things? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=323.3s)]
*  Are we just not gonna use certain types of money [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=325.52s)]
*  or certain types of currency? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=329.78s)]
*  Just again, because we charge so much [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=332.44s)]
*  and we use plastic or the whole cashless society idea [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=334.88s)]
*  that's been bandied about. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=339.52s)]
*  The end result is people just don't use [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  these smaller denominations, but you're still producing them [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=343.48s)]
*  and they don't actually make them back into circulation. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=346.48s)]
*  So what do you do about that? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=348.44s)]
*  Well, arguably this headline really jumped ahead [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=349.88s)]
*  of another headline that I think a lot of people [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=352.9s)]
*  are concerned about today. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=355.0s)]
*  And that is the fact that the president halted the work [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=356.38s)]
*  of a government agency that is meant to protect [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=359.32s)]
*  the American consumer. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=362.12s)]
*  We're talking about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=363.12s)]
*  Their mission baked right into their title. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=366.96s)]
*  Elon Musk posted on X about the agency [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=369.72s)]
*  with a rest in peace symbol. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=372.04s)]
*  This is super important, what's behind this? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=374.24s)]
*  Yeah, so the CFPB is exactly what the name implies. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=376.52s)]
*  It is an agency that was created in the last several years [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=379.72s)]
*  to protect consumers and sort of argue for their interests. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=382.74s)]
*  They usually go after banks over fees. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=387.94s)]
*  They go after credit cards over fees. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=390.3s)]
*  A lot of their bail-a-wick has to do with making sure [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=391.94s)]
*  that the consumer is not eating a lot of charges. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  And that's something that some view unfairly. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  But of course, the president and some in his camp [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=402.0s)]
*  do believe that there's been an element of overreach [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=407.0s)]
*  that maybe this agency has a little bit too much power, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=409.59999999999997s)]
*  it's unaccountable. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=412.76s)]
*  They force, again, companies to act. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=414.59999999999997s)]
*  And usually it's basically by doing a bully pulpit. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=416.91999999999996s)]
*  So there are some virtues in what they do. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=420.47999999999996s)]
*  And everyone wants to make sure the consumers are safe [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=422.88s)]
*  and not getting charged money [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=425.15999999999997s)]
*  or that they shouldn't have to pay. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  But at the end of the day, there's all this question. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=430.24s)]
*  If you're looking at the government holistically, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=433.38s)]
*  what it spends, how much power it should have, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=435.88s)]
*  what sort of power it should meet out, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=438.56s)]
*  the CFPB is kind of right in the crosshairs [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=441.56s)]
*  of that whole discussion. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=443.76s)]
*  All right, so for now it's just a work from home situation, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=445.14s)]
*  a work stoppage and a reevaluate and wait and see. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=447.72s)]
*  We appreciate so much you're talking to us today. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=450.36s)]
*  So many headlines to keep track of. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=453.24s)]
*  And it's only Monday. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhqUDEtv6I&t=455.24s)]
