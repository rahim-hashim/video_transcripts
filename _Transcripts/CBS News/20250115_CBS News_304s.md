*  I want to bring in CBS News correspondent Elise Preston who's following all of this from Altadena, California [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=15.6s)]
*  So from the very beginning Elise [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=22.2s)]
*  Officials police officials told us told you members of the media that there will be no tolerance at all for anyone taking advantage [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=25.119999999999997s)]
*  During these moments of heartbreak, but what are you learning about folks that they have arrested? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=33.239999999999995s)]
*  So we do know that we know at least one of those people that was a suspected [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=40.4s)]
*  Looter actually tried to arrive to a scene and they were dressed as a firefighter [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  They had some type of clothing, but they are not allowing anyone back [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=51.0s)]
*  We're here in this area that has been devastated by the fires as you can see they're not allowing anyone back here [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=55.04s)]
*  There are blockades at every checkpoint and we're running into [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=61.52s)]
*  Police officers sheriff's deputies and National Guardsmen and they are thoroughly checking IDs [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=66.28s)]
*  we have had to show two press badges and a driver's license just to ensure that we are who we say we are before [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=71.5s)]
*  We're able to get back here, you know [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=79.72s)]
*  There are some families that are able to stay not too far from this area that are in their in their homes [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  This morning and they also say that that looters will not be tolerated [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=88.76s)]
*  I passed a house just the other day Vlad and there was a giant sign and it clearly stated on on both sides of the house [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=92.64s)]
*  Looters will be shot. So, you know the homeowners have also said that they will not tolerate it either [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=100.4s)]
*  Hmm [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  Let's talk about [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=107.6s)]
*  Families that have been impacted by the fire as you actually spoke to one [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=109.08s)]
*  I know it's just one of thousands of people who are suffering and feeling that heartbreak. But what did this particular family tell you? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=112.55999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely devastating Vlad this home that I'm standing in front of is one of seven that family lost [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=122.35999999999999s)]
*  To the fire. These were multi generational homes four generations [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=129.88s)]
*  Lived in these homes and they all lived within a block of each other this family [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=134.64s)]
*  immigrated to the US from Costa Rica first in the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  1960s and they've lived in the same homes for decades for generations [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  And so when the fire broke out on Tuesday for the most part the family was able to get out of the home [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=147.88s)]
*  However, there was a relative an 86 year old 86 year old Neva Freedley who did not evacuate [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=154.24s)]
*  She did not leave her home and her family told us yesterday that she was found inside her home that they found her remains [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  So the family is grappling with a lot. They are lose their morning the loss of a loved one [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=168.88s)]
*  They're also dealing with the loss as we said a seven homes and 21 family members are displaced this morning [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=175.04s)]
*  I spoke to one of the older relatives [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=182.33999999999997s)]
*  He was the first one to come to the US from Costa Rica and he broke down so emotional Vlad [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=185.0s)]
*  He said, you know, I was a young man when I came to this country [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=189.85999999999999s)]
*  I came to this country with a close on my back and $50 and after 50 years of hard work [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=192.57999999999998s)]
*  I have nothing to show for it. I'm homeless [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=198.9s)]
*  and so the family is dealing with a lot though, they say they are faithful and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=201.29999999999998s)]
*  They will just continue to rely on each other and their faith [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=206.5s)]
*  That's such a horrible story and it's just one of so many at least thank you very much for your reporting appreciate it [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=211.54s)]
*  All right, let's bring in CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Grant Gilmore the first look at the national forecast Grant [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=218.72s)]
*  What are those winds looking at west? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=225.28s)]
*  It will look Vlad [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=228.32s)]
*  I think we have one more day of those particularly concerning gusty conditions out there to go along with the the low [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=229.36s)]
*  Relative humidity so about another 24 to 36 hours that all these people are gonna have to continue just to really be on on [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=235.64s)]
*  High alert red flag warnings in effect through much of the area across Southern, California, but there's this particularly dangerous situation [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=242.56s)]
*  That's highlighted in that red flag warning just north of LA into LA County up into Ventura County that we'll have to watch out for [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=250.12s)]
*  Not just the dry conditions, but those gusty winds that will be up there around 50 to 60 miles per hour [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=257.24s)]
*  Maybe some cases a little bit stronger than that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=262.8s)]
*  But compared to the last couple of days where we had extreme fire danger [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=264.72s)]
*  The the fire danger level today is a critical fire danger, which I mean we're really splitting hairs here [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=268.54s)]
*  So it's it's a little bit better. It gets a little bit better again tomorrow with with just an elevated risk for fire danger tomorrow [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=274.42s)]
*  Now the relative humidity will stay relatively low through tomorrow afternoon [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=280.78s)]
*  But the winds begin to die down tomorrow [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=284.64s)]
*  The relative humidity will begin to increase with more moisture returning as we head into Friday afternoon [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=285.98s)]
*  We got to talk about the cold cold air that's moving to the eastern half the United States [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=291.74s)]
*  It's cold now Vlad, but it gets much colder dangerously cold into next week. We'll have more on that forecast in just a bit [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=295.96000000000004s)]
*  Thank you grant. Appreciate it [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Iz_j-TgPY&t=302.6s)]
