# Trump signs flurry of executive orders in front of supporters
**CBS News:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4)
*  And no doubt the families of these hostages are grateful to both President Trump and President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=0.0s)]
*  Biden for their efforts to help bring their family members home. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  But was there a bit of an uncomfortable moment here when he was certainly equating the hostages [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=10.24s)]
*  in Gaza with the J-6 prisoners who have been convicted? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=17.56s)]
*  I don't think we need to remind people just how brutal being in captivity, captive of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=21.56s)]
*  Hamas and the associated terror organizations held in underground tunnels, raped, taken [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=27.68s)]
*  against your will, could be versus the justice system having a day in court and actual charges [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  and lawyers surrounding you. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=37.92s)]
*  There is no comparison. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=39.24s)]
*  Let's listen into what these executive orders are. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=41.96s)]
*  President Trump is a regulatory freeze, as you announced in your speech, preventing bureaucrats [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=44.28s)]
*  from issuing any more regulations until we have full control of this, the government [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  and this administration. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=52.96s)]
*  The next item, sir, is a freeze on all federal hiring, accepting the military's [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=53.96s)]
*  and a number of other excluded categories, again, until full control of the government [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=83.96s)]
*  is achieved and we understand the objectives of government going forward. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  Could you imagine Biden doing this? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=103.36s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=105.52s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  Sir, the next item, as you announced in your speech, is a requirement that federal workers [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=112.88s)]
*  return to full-time in-person work immediately. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=118.88s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=122.88s)]
*  Next we have a directive to every department and agency in the federal government to address [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=142.88s)]
*  the cost of living crisis that has cost Americans so dearly. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=147.48s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=170.48s)]
*  The next item here is the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Treaty. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=171.48s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=187.48s)]
*  We're going to save over a trillion dollars by withdrawing from that treaty. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=200.48s)]
*  And the next item, sir, is a letter that will be transmitted to the United Nations explaining [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=210.48s)]
*  that we are withdrawing from the Paris Climate Treaty. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=216.48s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=237.48s)]
*  This next item is a directive to the federal government ordering the restoration of freedom [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=238.48s)]
*  of speech and preventing government censorship of free speech going forward. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=243.48s)]
*  And lastly, sir, before we go back to the Oval Office to sign a large number of other items, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=262.48s)]
*  is a directive to the federal government ending the weaponization of government against the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=268.48s)]
*  political adversaries of the previous administration as we've seen. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=273.48s)]
*  Thank you very much, sir. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=297.48s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=299.48s)]
*  President Trump throwing some of his famous Sharpie pens into the crowd as he has just [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=313.48s)]
*  signed a number of these executive orders. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=320.48s)]
*  And Ed O'Keefe is our senior White House correspondent. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=323.48s)]
*  And Ed, these were not the orders on immigration. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=326.48s)]
*  Those could come later tonight. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=328.48s)]
*  But what was there? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=330.48s)]
*  As we watch the presidential version of a t-shirt toss here in the arena, he essentially began by [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=331.48s)]
*  reversing a series of Biden era policies. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=337.48s)]
*  We don't know yet exactly which ones, but the aid there said 78 of them and put a freeze on [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=340.48s)]
*  regulatory work by any federal agency court until we have full control. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=347.48s)]
*  Freeze on federal hiring, sending most federal employees back to the office immediately if they [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=351.48s)]
*  aren't already. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=356.48s)]
*  Important to point out there, though, there are several big agencies like IRS or the Federal [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=357.48s)]
*  Trade Commission that have separate labor negotiations and agreements that actually are going [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=361.48s)]
*  to allow some employees to keep working from home, which he'll not like, but which is just [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=366.48s)]
*  reality. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=371.48s)]
*  We're drawing from the Paris Climate Treaty and we are expecting later tonight the executive [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=372.48s)]
*  orders on immigration and he teased their pardons for January 6th defendants. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=377.48s)]
*  Remember, we said there were 250 of the 1,600 who have been imprisoned, incarcerated for violent [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=383.48s)]
*  offenses like violence against police officers on that day. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=389.48s)]
*  But you heard the president there say pardons for them are coming and incredibly equated those [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=393.48s)]
*  January 6th defendants with the hostages being held by Hamas in the Middle East right now. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=398.48s)]
*  Scott McFarland, those pardons have not yet come, but President Trump promising them. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=404.48s)]
*  What do we know about whether that could mean some of them are released tonight? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=408.48s)]
*  There's a growing expectation there's going to be wide swaths of pardons and releases [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=413.48s)]
*  imminently. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=418.48s)]
*  There's a crowd outside the Washington, D.C. jail where a couple dozen of the defendants have [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=419.48s)]
*  been held. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=423.48s)]
*  There are hundreds more elsewhere in the nation and, Nora, there is a sense it's a matter of [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=424.48s)]
*  when, not if, there are mass releases. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=429.48s)]
*  And Robert Costa, as we look at what happened today and a remarkable comeback for Donald [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=433.48s)]
*  Trump, who was defeated by Joe Biden after his first term in office and now has come [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=438.48s)]
*  back in this remarkable moment, has escaped prosecution, was under indictment, and yet [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=445.48s)]
*  now this governing now with a mandate, in his words. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=450.48s)]
*  It is the culmination of a remarkable story in American history to think about in 2015 [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=454.48s)]
*  when he launched his campaign. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=459.48s)]
*  Few expected him to ever win the nomination, let alone the presidency, twice after dealing [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=460.48s)]
*  with legal ups and downs, political ups and downs. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=465.48s)]
*  But now he is ready to use his power. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=468.48s)]
*  That just came through him signing these executive orders. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=471.48s)]
*  He's already making calls to Congress, talking to leaders on Capitol Hill. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=474.48s)]
*  And as he told me over the weekend, get ready. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=478.48s)]
*  And he said, be calm. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=480.48s)]
*  He said he knows a lot of people in this country are on edge about him coming back. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=481.48s)]
*  But he said at this point in his life, in his career, people should watch what he does, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=486.48s)]
*  see what happens, and that's what we'll do. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=490.48s)]
*  There was a lot of talk of grievance today. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=493.48s)]
*  He's very sensitive on some things. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=495.48s)]
*  But what a key Republican wants to explain to me, the thing about Donald Trump is he [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=497.48s)]
*  has an extraordinary pain threshold. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=501.48s)]
*  He's going to do things and people are going to say, that's crazy. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=503.48s)]
*  It'll never work. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=506.48s)]
*  Thinking back to that ride down the escalator, the things he said in that speech about immigration. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=507.48s)]
*  Oh, he's going to drop out immediately. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=511.48s)]
*  He's weathered through all of this. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=513.48s)]
*  And now in particular, all those people who said this is going to be bad and so forth and so on. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=515.48s)]
*  That gives him the kind of serenity to go through all of what is going to be a very active and chaotic period. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=519.48s)]
*  Margaret? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=526.48s)]
*  Strap in. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=527.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=529.48s)]
*  We'll be busy. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=530.48s)]
*  On day one of the Trump presidency, we are told he will be in the Oval Office tonight [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=531.48s)]
*  for more executive orders and actions as Trump promises what he called today in his inaugural address [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=537.48s)]
*  a revolution of common sense, a crackdown on immigration and changes to the federal bureaucracy and more. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=546.48s)]
*  For some of you, the CBS Evening News is next. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=554.48s)]
*  And tune in for our primetime special at 10 Eastern for all of our correspondents and guests at CBS News. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAG446-eet4&t=557.48s)]
