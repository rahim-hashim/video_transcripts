# Trump says he spoke to Putin about steps to end war with Ukraine
**CBS News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw)
*  President Trump says he has spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=0.0s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky about taking steps to end the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=4.88s)]
*  The announcement of the calls with Putin and Zelensky came just hours after Defense Secretary [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=9.58s)]
*  Pete Hegseth told a meeting of NATO representatives in Brussels what the U.S. expects when it [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=14.0s)]
*  comes to negotiations between the two countries. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  We will only end this devastating war and establish a durable peace by coupling allied [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=22.34s)]
*  strength with a realistic assessment of the battlefield. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=29.16s)]
*  We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=35.36s)]
*  But we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=41.68s)]
*  objective. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=48.8s)]
*  Secretary Hegseth went on to say that trying to establish those borders will, quote, only [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=50.36s)]
*  prolong the war and cause more suffering, end quote. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=54.04s)]
*  He also noted that NATO membership for Ukraine was unrealistic. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=56.8s)]
*  CBS News White House reporter Aaron Navarro joins us for more on this. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=60.64s)]
*  What more are we learning about the calls between President Trump and Putin and Zelensky? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=64.44s)]
*  Do we have any idea what these negotiations could look like and help us understand some [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=69.6s)]
*  of the significance of those headlines that Hegseth is making in Brussels? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=73.16s)]
*  We know that the White House has said that these calls were, quote, very positive, and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=77.4s)]
*  Trump in his social media post kind of outlined a team that would begin these initial negotiations, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=80.64s)]
*  including Secretary of State Rubio, his envoy, Steve Witkoff, who has been pretty active [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=86.72s)]
*  when it comes to kind of these negotiations, especially the one last night with Mark Fogel. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=90.36s)]
*  And we also know that NSA Director Michael Walz will also be involved. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  It seems clear just from what we heard from Caroline at the podium at the White House [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=101.76s)]
*  that the next clear step in all of this is a meeting with Vice President Vance, Secretary [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=105.64s)]
*  Rubio, and President Zelensky in Munich this Friday. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=110.76s)]
*  We could get a readout then. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  I thought it was interesting, though, that Caroline said that no red lines have been [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=115.88s)]
*  drawn by the president yet, yet you played that tidbit from Hegseth. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=120.52s)]
*  We know that President Zelensky has requested NATO membership, nuclear capabilities as part [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  of any agreement. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  So it's certainly an uphill battle, at least from what we know now, going into these talks [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=132.24s)]
*  on Friday. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=137.24s)]
*  Caroline also did not reveal if a potential visit by Trump to Russia to meet with Putin [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=139.16s)]
*  was a part of their negotiations to release Mark Fogel last night. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=144.84s)]
*  And Caroline did confirm that Alexander Vinnyk, a crypto who is arrested on cryptocurrency [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=149.08s)]
*  charges as a Russian prisoner, was part of the trade for Fogel last night. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=154.32s)]
*  So let's talk about that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  Could be additional releases between, for example, America, an American detainee who [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=162.2s)]
*  is held in Belarus. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=167.24s)]
*  Do we have any more information about this and what could be coming down the pike? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=168.24s)]
*  Yeah, we know at least today that there were three detainees released from Belarus, including [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=171.88s)]
*  one American and two from Belarus, including one who worked for Radio Liberty, an American-funded [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=177.04s)]
*  outlet. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=182.88s)]
*  The names were not revealed by Caroline per the request of them to not have that information [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=184.12s)]
*  out there. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=188.92s)]
*  And she did not comment or reveal any further details on what could be coming down the pike. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=189.92s)]
*  How is the White House responding, by the way, to a new lawsuit filed by at least eight [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=196.3s)]
*  inspectors general challenging what they claim are unlawful and unjustified terminations? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=200.72s)]
*  We have no legal response yet from the White House on this. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=207.04s)]
*  Now, this lawsuit that you mentioned is centered around the fact that the president did not [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=210.16s)]
*  notify Congress or give them a 30-day heads up about the firing of these inspector generals. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=214.88s)]
*  And CBS News learned that yesterday one more inspector general for the USAID was terminated [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=219.88s)]
*  as well. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=226.16s)]
*  That came after he issued a report on Monday that was critical of the Trump administration's [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=227.16s)]
*  moves to dismantle that agency. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=231.28s)]
*  Okay, Aaron DeVaro, thank you. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzhYciivTw&t=233.76s)]
