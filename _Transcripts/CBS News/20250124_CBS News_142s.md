**CBS News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY)
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=0.0s)]
*  As we reported earlier, President Trump [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=1.0s)]
*  is set to tour wildfire ravaged parts of Los Angeles later [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=3.0s)]
*  today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=6.9s)]
*  And this visit comes as Southern California continues [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  to battle ongoing wildfires that have killed at least 28 people [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=10.6s)]
*  now. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=14.8s)]
*  Fire crews have made progress in their fight [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=15.52s)]
*  against the Hughes fire, which has burned more than 10,000 [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=17.52s)]
*  acres and now stands at 36% contained. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=20.56s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Andres Gutierrez [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=24.04s)]
*  now joins us from Castaic in Southern California. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Andres, give us an update on the situation where you are. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=29.0s)]
*  It just looks like scorched earth behind you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=31.88s)]
*  It sure does, Errol. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=36.92s)]
*  And I will say that conditions are significantly improving out [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  here in Castaic. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=42.2s)]
*  We are believing that containment is staying at 36%. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=43.76s)]
*  They are inching halfway closer to that 50% mark. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=49.0s)]
*  But I will say that in the last 12 hours since I was out here [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=52.68s)]
*  yesterday, the winds were whipping at dust and some [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=55.88s)]
*  of the ash. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=58.52s)]
*  That will longer the case out here. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  Crews are right now tending to hot spots. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=61.24s)]
*  CAL FIRE did say that the strong winds did test some [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=63.64s)]
*  of the containment lines yesterday. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=66.48s)]
*  There was a spot fire that broke out [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=68.64s)]
*  on the western edge of the fire line, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=70.44s)]
*  burnt about 100 acres. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  And today, they are going to continue [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=75.16s)]
*  monitoring those hot spots and battling it up from the air [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=76.84s)]
*  in right here on the ground. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=80.60000000000001s)]
*  And I know Andres is just putting his earpiece back in. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=82.56s)]
*  But I want to speak about the legislation [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=85.28s)]
*  that Governor Newsom signed directing $2.5 billion [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=88.36s)]
*  in relief to those areas. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=91.16s)]
*  That is to come. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=93.28s)]
*  But they're still battling wildfires. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=95.04s)]
*  So has any area received aid so far? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=96.56s)]
*  What about the folks who are already in desperate need now? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=99.44s)]
*  Yeah, so the relief fund that was announced yesterday, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=105.0s)]
*  let me go ahead and break that down. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=108.28s)]
*  $2.5 billion, it's going to go for addressing sheltering, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=109.68s)]
*  as well as the removing of hazardous waste. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=114.48s)]
*  That's a big concern out here. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=117.84s)]
*  All this toxic ash and dust that has fallen [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=119.2s)]
*  in these neighborhoods, some of that money [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=122.48s)]
*  will go towards that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  The $2.5 billion will also go on top of the $4 million [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=125.84s)]
*  and $1 million that lawmakers have passed to rebuild homes [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=129.8s)]
*  and also support school districts [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=133.4s)]
*  as they start the process of rebuilding. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=135.16s)]
*  Yeah, such desperate need. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=137.44s)]
*  Andres, great to have you waking up with us this morning. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=138.72s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6D9Pm0COgY&t=141.16s)]
