# California firefighters racing to gain control of blazes before expected high winds pick up again
**CBS News:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po)
*  But we begin this hour with the deadly wildfires in California that have now tragically claimed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=0.0s)]
*  the lives of at least 24 people. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=5.08s)]
*  Crews are racing to gain control because of the powerful winds and the forecast that could [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  lead to additional spread. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=11.16s)]
*  One Altadena resident spoke to 60 Minutes about how quickly the fire destroyed his home. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  And out of nowhere, you see the fire appear across Lake Street, and you can see it going [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  on our side within an hour. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=26.26s)]
*  For it to move that quickly and that rapidly and for it to shift paths that fast was insane. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=30.340000000000003s)]
*  This is unreal. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=36.620000000000005s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=37.620000000000005s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News correspondent Elise Preston for more on this. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=38.620000000000005s)]
*  Elise, that is just one person on one street in one community. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=50.58s)]
*  But as you know, this story, that story, that pain, that heartbreak, that anguish is one [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=54.88s)]
*  that is being felt by thousands, if not hundreds of thousands across Los Angeles. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=60.52s)]
*  How are things developing on the ground this morning with those Santa Ana winds coming [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=67.12s)]
*  in? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=71.36s)]
*  Yeah, so they are expected to pick up Vlad and they are expected to top out at about [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=72.36s)]
*  70 miles per hour. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=78.6s)]
*  So you can see that is just a huge concern here because the Eaton fire, where it struck [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  out to Dena where I am right now, where that man who shared his story, where he was, the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=86.8s)]
*  Eaton fires only contain about 27%. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=92.16s)]
*  So firefighters are concerned that these winds are going to be able to kick back up and spread [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  that fire, spread all of the fires even more. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=99.84s)]
*  And it is happening in just an instant. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=103.46s)]
*  I have been in these neighborhoods, in these communities where you would see an ember [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=106.08s)]
*  and then a gust of wind would kick up out of nowhere and burst into flames and you [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=110.24s)]
*  would see it basically flying across the street, flying down the street and spreading at a [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  very, very rapid pace. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=119.64s)]
*  We are showing live pictures there, Elise, on the ground in Los Angeles so people can [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=123.32s)]
*  get a sense of the devastation that has occurred just in the last week. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=127.96s)]
*  Now the question of course, this is the live picture that we are talking about here, this [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=132.4s)]
*  is happening right now in Los Angeles and it is just utterly devastated, completely [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=136.4s)]
*  wiped out. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=142.04s)]
*  So the question of course becomes are the folks who have lost their homes, who have [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=143.04s)]
*  lost in many cases everything and thankfully still have their lives, are they able to get [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=147.72s)]
*  the resources that are available to them? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=152.84s)]
*  What kind of resources are being made available? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=155.06s)]
*  A lot of resources have poured in both from the federal and state level and then you are [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=159.2s)]
*  seeing a lot of humanity here. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=165.16s)]
*  You are seeing a lot of people really just open up their hearts and give. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=167.2s)]
*  We have been with families, we were with a family yesterday and some man came up to them [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=170.84s)]
*  and said, are you a victim? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=174.96s)]
*  Were you impacted by the fires? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=176.74s)]
*  And the family said yes and the man reached into his wallet, pulled out $100 and just [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=178.24s)]
*  gave it to the family and walked off. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=182.88s)]
*  You are seeing a lot of that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=184.96s)]
*  We went to this community drive where a man, it started with two hot dog carts and 500 [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=185.96s)]
*  hot dogs and so this man put out on a call on social media for people to respond and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=193.08s)]
*  boy did they, they have been showing up in hundreds, in droves just responding, giving [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  donations of food, of clothing, of household necessities and those are the things that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=205.68s)]
*  people need immediately, right? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=211.12s)]
*  This home that I am standing in front of, we were actually here yesterday with the family [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=213.64s)]
*  that lost their home and the mom said, son, you didn't bring better shoes, these shoes [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  aren't good, we are going to be walking around, it is dangerous and he said, mom, these are [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  the only shoes that I have and I think it just struck her how many things that they [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=227.2s)]
*  need just to get by in this immediate aftermath. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=233.11999999999998s)]
*  But as you said, it is going to be a long process. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=237.16s)]
*  Some families who have been hit, they had insurance and so they plan to rebuild but [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=241.46s)]
*  others, they are not so fortunate, they are saying that they lost their insurance either [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=245.74s)]
*  right before or during the fires. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=251.06s)]
*  The state has come out and said that the people who have insurance through the state's marketplace, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=253.5s)]
*  they will consider fast tracking those claims so that it can help people get back on their [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=258.62s)]
*  feet but people recognize that it is going to be a long and hard process to endure that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=264.86s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=270.86s)]
*  Elise Preston for us this morning. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=271.86s)]
*  Elise, thank you very much. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=273.42s)]
*  Well, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell says she is concerned that the powerful winds in [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=275.42s)]
*  the area have changed the dynamics of the fire and she fears for the safety of the firefighters. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=280.94s)]
*  She spoke with Margaret Brennan on Face the Nation this week where she pushed back on [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=286.34000000000003s)]
*  claims that LA officials were unprepared. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=289.74s)]
*  I think that they were very prepared. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=292.94s)]
*  This is something that they are very used to. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=295.06s)]
*  They fight fires all the time. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=297.21999999999997s)]
*  But they have never seen 100 mile an hour winds that are fueling the fire. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=299.18s)]
*  And those winds and that weather condition is what really impacts, you know, where this [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=304.09999999999997s)]
*  fire is going to go, but more importantly, how they're able to try to contain it in [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=308.46s)]
*  those first few hours and days. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=312.26s)]
*  And because it was in such a populated area, it just makes it that much more challenging [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=314.36s)]
*  to be able to get in there and secure the perimeter, but as well try to save as many [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=319.42s)]
*  homes as possible. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=323.58000000000004s)]
*  And if you're looking for a way to help the victims of these wildfires, you can go to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=326.14000000000004s)]
*  redcross.org slash CBS. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=329.34000000000003s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Kate Bailo with the first look at the national [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=332.5s)]
*  forecast. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=336.38s)]
*  Hey, Kate. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=337.38s)]
*  Hey, Vlad. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=338.38s)]
*  And of course, the big story once again is the fire danger in Southern California because [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=339.38s)]
*  the winds are picking back up. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=343.78000000000003s)]
*  We have a red flag warning to tell you about in that part of Southern California, and that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=346.54s)]
*  is only going to serve to continue to fan these flames. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=350.62s)]
*  So let's take a look at conditions. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=353.66s)]
*  This is our fire weather outlook for today. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=355.22s)]
*  And again, you can see the worst of it where you see the pink just north of Los Angeles [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=356.98s)]
*  County there. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=360.82000000000005s)]
*  That's where we have extreme fire danger today. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=361.82000000000005s)]
*  Winds could gust 50 to 70 miles per hour once again. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=364.78000000000003s)]
*  So the winds died down a little bit. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=369.22s)]
*  We got some containment, but now the threat for further fire spread is increasing. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=370.94s)]
*  So we're going to go through today and into tomorrow as well. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=375.46s)]
*  Strongest gusts are in the mountains, very dry air as well, relative humidities in the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=378.7s)]
*  10 to 15 percent range. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=383.26s)]
*  And that's all day today and all day tomorrow. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=385.26s)]
*  It may come up a little bit as we head into Wednesday. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=387.78s)]
*  But here's tomorrow's fire weather outlook. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=390.65999999999997s)]
*  Pretty much the same with that extreme fire danger just north of Los Angeles County. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=392.58s)]
*  That's where the most extreme threat for additional fire spread and additional fires to start. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=397.38s)]
*  That's where the threat is. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=403.26s)]
*  And that's all day today and all day tomorrow. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=404.42s)]
*  And again, you can see the worst of it where you see the pink just north of Los Angeles [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=407.42s)]
*  County. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=410.86s)]
*  That's where we have extreme fire danger just north of Los Angeles County. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=411.86s)]
*  And that's all day today and all day tomorrow. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=414.86s)]
*  And again, you can see the worst of it where you see the threat for additional fire spread [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=417.86s)]
*  and additional fires to start. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=421.82s)]
*  That's where the most extreme fire threat for additional fire spread and additional [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=423.82s)]
*  fire spread and additional fires to start. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=427.38s)]
*  And again, you can see the worst of it where you see the threat for additional fire spread [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktqXDl29Po&t=430.38s)]
