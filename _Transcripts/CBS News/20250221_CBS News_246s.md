# Judge allows Trump's government workforce cuts to continue
**CBS News:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk)
*  A federal judge will allow the Trump administration's efforts to cut the government workforce to continue. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=0.0s)]
*  The judge declined a request from labor unions for relief. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  As the judge says, he lacks jurisdiction and says the claims must be filed with federal labor relations authorities. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=10.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, Argentina's president did this, handed Elon Musk a chainsaw on stage at CPAC yesterday. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=16.52s)]
*  During remarks on stage, Musk praised the work of the Trump administration to cut the federal workforce. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News correspondent Natalie Brand. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=30.12s)]
*  You see there at the White House and watched all of this. Natalie, let's start with Elon Musk at CPAC. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=32.08s)]
*  Tell us about that chainsaw and his message to supporters there. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  Good morning, Errol. Well, that chainsaw was a gift from Argentina's president Javier Malé, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=43.16s)]
*  who we've seen is close with the Trump administration. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=48.52s)]
*  Malé actually used a chainsaw on the campaign trail back in 2023 during rallies to symbolize cuts to government spending. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=52.08s)]
*  Now, Musk wielding that chainsaw on stage yesterday at CPAC said that this chainsaw is for bureaucracy. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=62.76s)]
*  It comes, of course, as he moves to slash federal government spending. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=71.64s)]
*  Doge, the Department of Government Efficiency, led by Musk, as we've seen, is laying off thousands of federal employees. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=77.44000000000001s)]
*  And his reception, Errol, at CPAC also shows how close of an adviser he has become to President Trump, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  how he's been embraced by the conservative base that supports President Trump. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=93.84s)]
*  But interesting to note, Errol, what we saw this week over on Capitol Hill, some Republicans, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=99.72s)]
*  namely Senator Murkowski of Alaska, speaking out against some of these federal employee firings, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=106.36s)]
*  which are impacting red states and blue states. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=113.16s)]
*  It's so many thousands of federal employees work outside of Washington, D.C., in these individual cities and states, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=116.52s)]
*  jobs that are really important to the community. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=124.44s)]
*  So as more layoffs and these individual stories come to light, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=126.76s)]
*  we'll have to see whether more Republican lawmakers speak out. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=130.76s)]
*  Note that it's impacting so many professionals' lives across the country. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=136.6s)]
*  And you have this ruling now by the federal judge not to intervene. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=141.16s)]
*  How is the White House and how are unions responding to that ruling, which effectively allows these cuts to continue? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=144.28s)]
*  Yeah, this ruling late yesterday was a legal win in court for the Trump administration. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=152.2s)]
*  We'll have to see how the unions who filed this suit, five unions, respond, what their next moves will be. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=158.68s)]
*  But essentially, the judge said that he is allowing for now this effort to downsize the firings to continue [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=166.04s)]
*  because he said that he does not have jurisdiction over the case. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=173.64s)]
*  He said that the unions must pursue their challenges through the Federal Labor Relations Authority. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=178.12s)]
*  That's an agency which handles labor disputes between federal employee unions and management. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=183.48s)]
*  But Judge Cooper in this ruling, he's from Washington, D.C., [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=191.88s)]
*  he did note that if the unions lose there, that they could then continue the court battle through the appeals process. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=195.0s)]
*  And I want to note, Errol, in his ruling, in his court order yesterday, he did signal concern. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=202.84s)]
*  In fact, the first sentence of his order, let me read it to you. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=208.6s)]
*  It says the first month of President Trump's second administration has been defined by, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=212.12s)]
*  quote, an onslaught of executive actions that have caused, some say by design, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  disruption and even chaos in widespread quarters of American society. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=221.64s)]
*  And Errol, I want to mention I reached out to another union which has filed a separate suit [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  on the same issue of the federal employee layoff. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=233.0s)]
*  So we'll have to see what happens to that lawsuit and again, how the unions in this first one choose to move forward. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=236.11999999999998s)]
*  All right, we appreciate all those updates. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=243.39999999999998s)]
*  Natalie Brand, thank you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17uPnU_osKk&t=244.92s)]
