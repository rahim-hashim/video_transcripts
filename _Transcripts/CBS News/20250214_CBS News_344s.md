# Trump says he knows nothing about Eric Adams case
**CBS News:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y)
*  Welcome back. President Trump said today he doesn't know very much, if anything at all, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=0.0s)]
*  about Eric Adams and New York City mayors' legal controversy. Let's take a listen to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=4.84s)]
*  that. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=8.92s)]
*  I don't know about it. I mean, obviously I'm not involved in that. But I would say this, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=9.92s)]
*  that if they had a problem, and these are mostly people from the previous administration, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=13.72s)]
*  you understand, so they weren't going to be there anyway. They were going to all be gone [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=18.04s)]
*  or dismissed. But I know nothing about the individual case. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=21.28s)]
*  Harry Lidman joins us now. He's a former U.S. attorney and host of the Talking Fed [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=25.36s)]
*  podcast. Harry, first of all, do you believe what the president said today? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=29.84s)]
*  He's mistaken. Well, first of all, it is interesting. I was reminded of a few moments in his first [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  term where he disavowed any knowledge. The deputy attorney general and attorney general [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=41.56s)]
*  are making clear that this comes from his priorities. But in any event, his statement [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  is false, Major. We're talking about career professionals who have resigned, and not just [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=51.7s)]
*  career professionals. We really are talking about the Navy SEALs of the DOJ, the most [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=57.74s)]
*  proud vaunted unit who prosecute public integrity around the country and the treatment at the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=63.38s)]
*  hands of the attorney general and the acting deputy attorney general, I have to say is [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=71.22s)]
*  the most savage and brutal mistreatment of DOJ professionals in the department's history. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=76.38s)]
*  It's cataclysmic within the department. Why is it cataclysmic? Is it because in this order, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=83.61999999999999s)]
*  the Justice Department acknowledged that the order was being given without any analysis [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=90.25999999999999s)]
*  of the facts of the case or the law? Or is it something even bigger than that? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=96.19999999999999s)]
*  Well, that is the premise, right, that the deputy attorney general, I think very unwisely [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=100.62s)]
*  said we're not doing this because of facts and law. And that's the really the marrow [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=104.62s)]
*  of what the DOJ does. That's of course what it does. But then in addition to take it a [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=110.5s)]
*  step further as the AG spokesperson just has, and essentially call them dishonest, pretextual, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=116.46s)]
*  acting on politics grounds, it's an Alice in Wonderland kind of discourse that has it [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=123.74s)]
*  exactly wrong. Anybody, I mean anybody of any political stripe who's been in the department [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  knows that that's simply false. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=136.18s)]
*  And the people who have resigned, let's just name check two, Danielle Sassoon and Hagen [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=139.86s)]
*  Scotton. These are not people who are or could be even alleged or suggested to either be [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  liberals or progressives. They have fine conservative legal backgrounds, groundings. Not that that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=153.82000000000002s)]
*  should matter, but in case people want to jump to any kind of political conclusion, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=160.9s)]
*  it doesn't seem from these two at least, Harry, that that can be made. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=165.26s)]
*  Yeah, so it's more than that. But these two major are really out of a nightmare out of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=169.06s)]
*  central casting for the administration. We're talking about a Scalia clerk, a John Roberts [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=174.98s)]
*  clerk. John Roberts can't be happy today, who served two, got two bronze medals for [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=180.98s)]
*  his service in Iraq, who says in his letter, I'm not against the administration generally, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=186.14s)]
*  it says, this is not how we do it in the Department of Justice. You have to understand. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=191.42s)]
*  Sassoon said, I'd be glad to discuss it. If not, I may have to resign. And the deputy [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=197.42s)]
*  attorney general said, we accept your resignation. They then pull it into main justice and have [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=203.77999999999997s)]
*  the entire, what a sort of dramatic image from today. They locked the entire public [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=209.38s)]
*  integrity unit, some 30 lawyers in a room, as if they're truant school children who've [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=215.45999999999998s)]
*  shoplifted a pack of lifesavers and says, you're not coming out until one of you agrees [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=221.89999999999998s)]
*  to dismiss the case. This is really incredibly high handed, disrespectful, brutal, Stalinist, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=227.14s)]
*  really without any close to precedent in DOJ history. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=236.89999999999998s)]
*  Harry, for those who are not familiar, the Southern District of New York has a formidable [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=242.78s)]
*  and well earned reputation for being formidable within the Justice Department. What are the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=248.14s)]
*  echo effects if it is bullied across the entire country? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=252.5s)]
*  Yeah, they are profound. And I think also to the judges in the country, everyone stands [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=257.53999999999996s)]
*  up in the country with pride saying, we're from the Department of Justice. We do prosecutions [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=263.18s)]
*  without fear or favor. And here they're not only told to do it in a different way, but [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=267.9s)]
*  if they don't. And you're right about the SDNY, but some people will say, oh, they are [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=274.18s)]
*  mavericks. The people at main justice major, the public integrity section, the assistant [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=279.18s)]
*  attorney general, top person for criminal, all of whom were put in by Trump in the last [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=286.42s)]
*  few weeks. Those folks, everyone in the department knows our career, our honest do it the right [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=291.5s)]
*  way. So it's a terrible brain drain for DOJ, but it's an absolute kick in the gut for how [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=298.46000000000004s)]
*  everybody in the DOJ learned to do their job and stand up and make decisions based on facts [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=305.1s)]
*  and law. And here that they're brazen enough to say, no facts or law problem. Nevertheless, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=312.66s)]
*  you must do this. And then to insult them as being pretextual and political for not [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=318.42s)]
*  doing it. It is a very dark day. And yes, everyone in the 94 U.S. attorney's offices [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=324.06s)]
*  today without regard to their party affiliation is, you know, takes this as a kick in the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=330.14000000000004s)]
*  teeth without a doubt. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=336.54s)]
*  Ramifications today, quite possibly ramifications to come. Harry Littman, thank you very much. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6C-WftL9Y&t=339.22s)]
