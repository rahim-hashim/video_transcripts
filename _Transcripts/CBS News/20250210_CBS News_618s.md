# New poll on Trump approval rating as steel, aluminum tariffs set
**CBS News:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU)
*  All right, let's start with this a 25% blanket tariff on all steel and aluminum expected to come sometime today [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=0.0s)]
*  The latest threat for President Trump as a trade war between the US and its top trading partners ramps up [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=8.28s)]
*  It's unclear if that tax will be added on top of the sweeping 10% tariff already in place for countries like China [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=14.96s)]
*  But Trump says the announcement will quote help US steel. Take a listen [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=22.92s)]
*  So I will also be announcing steel tariffs on Monday [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=28.24s)]
*  Everybody steel including Canada. Yeah any steel coming into the United States is going to have a 25% [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=36.76s)]
*  Aluminum to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=46.0s)]
*  Know 25% [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=48.44s)]
*  25 for both [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=50.92s)]
*  It won't have a majority [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=58.36s)]
*  States nobody can have a majority stake for us steel they can for other companies, but not for us [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=59.4s)]
*  I think you agree with that US steel was one of our great companies and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=65.36s)]
*  Through a lot of stupidity and bad government and also bad management of the company. It lost that luster [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=69.92s)]
*  But it's gonna gain it back and tariffs are gonna help [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=76.92s)]
*  Meanwhile China firing back on that original 10% tax with a list of their own [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=80.74s)]
*  Here are the counter tariffs on US goods set to kick in today [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=86.82s)]
*  15% on coal [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=91.17999999999999s)]
*  15% on liquefied natural gas [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=93.89999999999999s)]
*  10% on crude oil 10% on agricultural machinery and 10% on large engine cars [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=97.17999999999999s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News White House digital reporter Aaron Navarro who is live in DC and breaks it all down for us [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=104.9s)]
*  Aaron thank you so much for being here. The president says tariffs are gonna help bring back US steel. So how is that gonna happen? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=110.86s)]
*  Well, it's good afternoon what impact these tariffs that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=120.38s)]
*  President Trump has announced could have is heightened interest in US steel and generally domestic production of steel and aluminum since it's [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=123.5s)]
*  Expected to be more costly for imports of these goods from other countries [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=131.54s)]
*  We've seen share prices for a handful of US companies rise this morning as well [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=136.1s)]
*  What it could hurt however is the price for home building and the auto industry the US imports a significant amount of steel and especially [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=140.73999999999998s)]
*  Aluminum from other countries and if you just look at maybe the Detroit area in Ontario [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  Tariffs on steel there could really impact the auto industry and kind of the linked economy that those two areas have [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=153.85999999999999s)]
*  He also previewed another set of tariffs gonna be going to affect potentially later on this week [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=160.62s)]
*  Can you walk us through some of those? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=165.78s)]
*  Yeah, this is something he announced last week during a presser with Japanese Prime Minister [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=169.14s)]
*  Reciprocal tariffs that he said would be announced on Tuesday or or Wednesday [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=174.34s)]
*  These are basically tariffs that will match tariffs levied by other countries in the United States [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=178.38s)]
*  But it thinks it's expected to really impact Canada and Mexico the European Union [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=182.57999999999998s)]
*  China and Japan with these tariffs but big picture [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=187.42000000000002s)]
*  Trump has really portrayed tariffs as a way to fix trade deficits with other countries particularly [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=191.74s)]
*  Canada and Europe the latest steel tariffs these reciprocal tariffs are the latest step in that vision [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=198.82000000000002s)]
*  You know the video you just saw there on your screen was snippets of that Super Bowl interview the president did with Fox News [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=204.06s)]
*  Now this clip on the president's plan for Gaza just out this morning. Let's take a listen to that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=210.38s)]
*  Will build beautiful communities for the 1.9 million people will build beautiful communities safe communities could be five six could be two [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=216.9s)]
*  But will build safe communities a little bit away from where they are where all of this danger is in the meantime I would [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=224.62s)]
*  Own this think of it as a real estate development for the future [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=232.38s)]
*  It would be a beautiful piece of land with the Palestinians have no big money spent [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=237.62s)]
*  No, they wouldn't because they're gonna have much better housing much better in other words [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=242.5s)]
*  I'm talking about building a permanent place for them because if they have to return now [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=247.82000000000002s)]
*  It'll be years before you could ever it's not habitable [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=252.44s)]
*  It will be years before it could happen. I'm talking about starting to build and I think I could make a deal with Jordan [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=255.82000000000002s)]
*  I think I could make a deal with Egypt, you know, we give them billions and billions of dollars a year [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=261.3s)]
*  Yeah, I want to lean into this a little bit Aaron [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=266.06s)]
*  Do we have any more details on where the people of Gaza would go if the US follows through and taking over the region? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=268.3s)]
*  I mean mentioned Jordan in Egypt, but any other plans? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=275.14s)]
*  Yeah, this question in Trump's plan of whether Palestinians can return to Gaza in general [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=280.82s)]
*  And if so, when is the key thing to watch on this topic over the weekend and that clip you showed? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=285.34000000000003s)]
*  Trump seemed to indicate because the country is so torn up now in part due to the Israeli military strikes that came as they have [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=290.3s)]
*  Tried to root out the Hamas Palestinians would not be able to return in the next few years [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=296.74s)]
*  He suggested that Palestinians would have permanent homes and other neighboring countries such as Jordan or Egypt [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=301.06s)]
*  Though it's important to note that many of these countries have rejected Trump's idea though as you saw in that clip [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=307.74s)]
*  He often says that he can quote make a deal with these countries [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=313.74s)]
*  Erin Navarro, thank you so much for breaking it all down for us [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=317.86s)]
*  Well as president Trump carries out his agenda the latest CBS News polling shows the majority of people [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=321.29999999999995s)]
*  Approve of the work he's done so far in fact 70% say the president is doing exactly [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=327.61999999999995s)]
*  What he promised in his campaign and as far as Trump's overall job rating? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=333.58s)]
*  53% approve CBS News elections and surveys executive director Anthony Salvanto has more on what this all means [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=339.85999999999996s)]
*  Anthony just [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=347.65999999999997s)]
*  Starting off just break down the latest polling for us. What are all these questions? And what does the polling kind of indicate to you? I? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=348.98s)]
*  Think one of the things behind the numbers you just showed everybody there Liz is [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=356.46000000000004s)]
*  When we looked at what we had people describe about Donald Trump during the campaign [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=360.86s)]
*  Words that they thought described him and we asked them now you see these big numbers that sustain [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=366.3s)]
*  views that he is tough [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=373.62s)]
*  Energetic focused all of these things are some of the reasons that you see those positive [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=376.34000000000003s)]
*  Approval numbers and the other one that you mentioned there [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=382.5s)]
*  I'll point out you know this 70% of saying he's doing what he promised [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=385.26s)]
*  That's whether you approve of him or not, but there does appear to be political value [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=390.58s)]
*  They're especially for folks who voted for him for his supporters [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=395.94s)]
*  They see somebody who is [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=399.74s)]
*  Doing what he said he would do in the campaign and that's how the people get a general sense of things [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=402.02s)]
*  Especially in the early days of an administration list. So how do these numbers compare to Trump's first term in office? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=407.86s)]
*  His approval numbers now are better than anything he had in his first term Wow and what's [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=416.46s)]
*  Particularly interesting about that is you drill down a little on some of the policies right now that people are looking at [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=423.78s)]
*  Not all of them are getting positive returns right now, but some of the more let me point out these his program to deport [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=431.06s)]
*  immigrants who are [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=438.74s)]
*  Illegally in the US gets approval again back to this idea of echoing the campaign [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=440.14s)]
*  We saw voters approving of that idea in the campaign when they voted for him and you know somewhat relieved [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=445.14s)]
*  Sending troops US troops to the US Mexico border again gets even higher gets two-thirds of [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=453.74s)]
*  Approval and then his supporters like the focus on some other things like cutting government spending [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=460.53999999999996s)]
*  Other aspects where you see especially for that base people saying right at the outset [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=466.26s)]
*  Anyway, he's delivering a lot of what they expected. What about the view on tariffs? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=471.3s)]
*  I mean people are obviously going to feel the effects in their wallets. Do they think that these tariffs are a good idea? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=476.09999999999997s)]
*  So that points Liz to one of the bigger gaps between what people were expecting and what they're seeing right now [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=483.21999999999997s)]
*  So let me start with tariffs, which is this and you'll see that majorities do not [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=489.46s)]
*  Favor tariffs new tariffs on goods from Mexico Europe Canada all of that only China gets a majority [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=494.34s)]
*  Approving there and the reason for that is that most people tell us they think that tariffs would raise prices now [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=501.3s)]
*  Behind that we also see that we get this number and this speaks to that idea [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=508.38s)]
*  I said earlier about that gap between delivering and expectations [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=513.66s)]
*  You get two-thirds including a lot of Republicans who say that the administration so far is not focusing enough in their view on [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=518.52s)]
*  Lowering prices and you may recall [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=526.5s)]
*  Inflation was one of the big reasons maybe the big reason that Donald Trump won [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=528.98s)]
*  So you want to watch that you want to watch that difference between delivery and expectations? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=532.74s)]
*  And I think tariffs clearly relates to that dynamic list [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=537.1s)]
*  Yeah [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=540.82s)]
*  Another question that you posed was about Elon Musk and Doge and the numbers were interesting giving the pushback we've heard from lawmakers [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=541.3000000000001s)]
*  What did you find? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=548.5s)]
*  So the first thing you see here is really partisan splits, right? You see most Republicans say yeah, okay [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=551.0600000000001s)]
*  His Doge task force and Elon Musk should have at least some influence on what's going on [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=558.38s)]
*  Though not necessarily a lot and that a lot number is really a lot more of folks who say they're part of the MAGA movement [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=564.7800000000001s)]
*  Maybe that's not surprising, but that's where a lot of that push is coming from now when I say partisan [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=571.58s)]
*  You see a lot of Democrats here the bulk of Democrats saying not much or no [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=576.5200000000001s)]
*  influence for Elon Musk and Doge [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=581.1800000000001s)]
*  But the other part here is I think from a public opinion standpoint [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=583.26s)]
*  This is one that may take a while to play out right now [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=587.22s)]
*  We know this especially for Republicans that ideas like cutting government spending have always been popular cutting foreign aid have always been [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=590.68s)]
*  Popular so those broad goals you're gonna find a lot of agreement from the base [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=598.9599999999999s)]
*  But what happens as all of this plays out over the coming weeks and months starts to impact people one way or the other [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=602.7199999999999s)]
*  That's where I think you'll watch these numbers and see how public opinion unfolds list. Yeah, it's interesting to watch. No question Anthony Salvante [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=609.5999999999999s)]
*  Thank you [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P895XzMzxQU&t=617.04s)]
