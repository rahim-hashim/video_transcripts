# How Trump's steel, aluminum tariffs will affect Americans
**CBS News:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I)
*  Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said to announce new tariffs today. He's expected to roll out 25% [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=0.0s)]
*  tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., including from Canada and Mexico. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=5.76s)]
*  And he says more tariff announcements could come later on this week. Let's bring in Kristen Meyer. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=12.4s)]
*  She is the editor-in-chief of ETF.com. Kristen, great to see you. What do we use steel and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=17.52s)]
*  aluminum for and how would Trump's tariffs impact American consumers? Would this happen right away? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=23.36s)]
*  Yeah, so that's a really great question. The reality is, is that tariffs are not going to [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=29.2s)]
*  immediately impact consumers, mainly because a lot of companies that sell us goods have a little bit [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  of a backlog, you can say. They have already some items already in their warehouses or in their [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=38.96s)]
*  stores that we're going to buy. However, down the line, we are going to see that tariffs will impact [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  consumers as we essentially have to pay the cost of those taxes that those companies or those [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=49.44s)]
*  importers are paying. Now, when it comes to those steel and those aluminum tariffs that are [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=54.72s)]
*  essentially going to be levied against essentially all countries that are sort of importing or [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=60.0s)]
*  exporting rather that steel and that aluminum here to the United States, two things are going [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=64.8s)]
*  to happen. One, you're going to see a lot of domestic steel and domestic aluminum companies [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=68.64s)]
*  get a little bit of an advantage as you're going to start seeing consumers say, listen, we're not [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=73.28s)]
*  going to, we're not interested in paying these higher costs and companies saying we're not going [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=77.52s)]
*  to pay these higher tariffs. And they start looking elsewhere for those products. Now, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=81.36s)]
*  where is steel used? I mean, look no further than essentially the industrials look no further than [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=85.84s)]
*  real estate. A lot of businesses, companies are being built off of steel and aluminum. A lot of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=91.92s)]
*  products have steel and aluminum in them. And so we're going to see a lot of industries really [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=97.04s)]
*  being impacted. What about China, Kristen? I mean, they hit back on Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=101.76s)]
*  with its own tariffs on U.S. goods. That takes effect today. And China's tariffs include a 15% [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=107.52s)]
*  levy on all imports of U.S. coal, liquefied natural gas, as well as a 10% tariff on American crude oil, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=114.72s)]
*  agricultural machinery, and large engine cars. So at this point, is there any possibility that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  the U.S. and China could strike a deal? I mean, I guess there's always a possibility, but now we're [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=128.4s)]
*  really starting to see these tariffs take effect and people are going to start to feel the pain. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=134.32s)]
*  Yeah. So this is exactly what happens in a trade war. You know, one country says, hey, we're going [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  to impose tariffs on your goods. And the other country says, guess what? We're going to do the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=143.12s)]
*  same thing right back to you. And that is exactly what we are seeing when it comes to the U.S. and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  China. And frankly, it's also what we saw when President Trump essentially said that he was going [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=152.24s)]
*  to put a 25% tariff against goods that are imported from Canada and Mexico. Canada and Mexico said, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  guess what? We are also going to start imposing retaliatory tariffs. Now, is it too late? The [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=163.04s)]
*  answer is, of course, no. U.S. and China can always go back to the negotiating table and sort of cobble [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=169.12s)]
*  out some sort of trade deal. Who loses in some of these trade wars? Frankly, it's you, me, and also [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  the consumers inside of China that are essentially going to lose because we have to pay the cost of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=181.2s)]
*  some of these higher goods. Now, who's going to be impacted? You just named those industries. We've [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=186.48s)]
*  got coal, the energy industry, coal. We've got liquefied natural gas. These are all communities, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=190.48s)]
*  lots of which voted for President Trump that are going to be impacted in states like West Virginia, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=195.76s)]
*  for example. It's going to be those domestic industries that are going to be really hard hit. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=201.12s)]
*  As Chinese consumers say, we're not interested in paying higher prices for some of these goods. And [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  it's going to be those Chinese importers that are going to say, we are going to find our energy [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=210.64s)]
*  resources from elsewhere. Yeah. Another interesting move from the president that we want to ask you [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=215.6s)]
*  about, Kristen, and that he ordered the U.S. Treasury to stop minting new pennies, claiming [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=221.6s)]
*  producing the one cent coin costs more than it's worth. What's going on here? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=227.84s)]
*  You know what? This is actually a great idea. I have to say I'm very on board for stopping the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  minting of the U.S. penny because it costs almost four cents to make one penny. So it is actually [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=238.24s)]
*  a revenue loser essentially that we have for some of these very low denomination coins. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=245.67999999999998s)]
*  The caveat to this, of course, is that if we get rid of the penny, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=251.12s)]
*  essentially companies and customers are going to start looking towards other lower denomination [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=255.28s)]
*  coins. And the next one up is going to be the nickel, which means that the U.S. mint might need [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=259.44s)]
*  to make more nickels to essentially fill the gap that is being left behind from this essentially [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  seizing to mint the U.S. penny. Here's the rub with that, though. It costs a lot of money to [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=270.64s)]
*  make a nickel. It costs way more than it costs to make a penny. It costs about 15 cents to make a [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  nickel. So it actually might not be the sort of cost saving strategy that the president is really [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  hoping for. But listen, he's not the first politician or even, frankly, the first consumer [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=288.47999999999996s)]
*  group that has gone out there and said, we need to stop making the penny. We don't use it. It costs [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=292.08s)]
*  a lot of money to make. And frankly, consumers are moving more towards a digital only economy [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=296.96s)]
*  where they're not even pulling cash out of their out of their wallets anymore. So why bother with [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=302.47999999999996s)]
*  the penny anymore? To start collecting them, make little books of these pennies. And in 20, 30 years, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=307.52s)]
*  you can say all the quarters out there. There you go. Brand new industry collecting pennies. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=312.79999999999995s)]
*  Where are pennies? All right, Kristen Myers, thank you so much. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBNHytmvI4I&t=318.79999999999995s)]
