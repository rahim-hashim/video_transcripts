# Details on what Trump's new tariffs will impact, world reaction
**CBS News:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I)
*  Many Americans are bracing for the impact now of President Trump's new tariffs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=0.0s)]
*  They're set to go into effect tomorrow. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=4.0s)]
*  CBS News estimates that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and those 10% tariffs on China [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=6.5s)]
*  will shrink economic output by 0.4% and increase taxes by $1.2 trillion between 2025 and 2034. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  CBS News Money Watch correspondent Kelly O'Grady joins me now to help break this all down. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=23.92s)]
*  Kelly, help us understand how tariffs function. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=28.64s)]
*  President Trump seems to characterize it as a threat for another nation. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  But how will it impact U.S. industries and consumers? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=35.92s)]
*  Well, it's good to be with you, Errol. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=38.88s)]
*  So basically, when a company is importing a good, they are the ones that are going to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=42.04s)]
*  pay that tariff, that tax. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=46.44s)]
*  It's not going to be Mexico, Canada or China. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=48.34s)]
*  It's going to be the domestic company. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  And then they can decide whether to eat that cost and let it impact their bottom line or [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=52.8s)]
*  Now, the industries that are going to get impacted are wide ranging. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=58.18s)]
*  Mexico, think fruits and vegetables, manufacturing, cars, alcohol. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=62.9s)]
*  Canada, cars is a big one as well, as is lumber, aluminum, steel and energy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=67.9s)]
*  And then pretty much everything is manufactured in China. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=73.1s)]
*  So you're looking at toys, clothing, electronics, furniture. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=76.22s)]
*  In 2023, we imported $1.3 trillion in goods across these three countries. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=79.9s)]
*  So this is a big deal, Errol. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=84.86s)]
*  As I was leading into you, I spoke about the billions in cost over a decade. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=87.25999999999999s)]
*  These numbers can be almost theoretical for our regular day to day lives. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=91.66s)]
*  And as you've just laid out, it will depend on the industry and the business. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=96.46s)]
*  So how much of a price increase should people watching realistically expect? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=99.66s)]
*  OK, so broadly, prices are going to go up. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=106.74s)]
*  How long it takes for them to go up will depend on the industry, the inventory. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=108.89999999999999s)]
*  It could be as much as six to nine months. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=113.1s)]
*  I want to give you the car company as an example. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=115.3s)]
*  So if a car company imports a vehicle from Mexico, they're going to pay a 25 percent [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=117.94s)]
*  tariff, but that is on the wholesale price. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=123.1s)]
*  So you're not going to see a full 25 percent increase when you go to the dealership. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=125.78s)]
*  Does become a little bit more complicated when parts are going across the border [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=130.5s)]
*  multiple times when you're assembling a car. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=134.26s)]
*  So a tariff could be applied multiple times there, but it's really going to depend on [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=136.57999999999998s)]
*  the industry. The one thing that I do want to highlight is there is a 10 percent tariff [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=140.26s)]
*  on Canadian energy. That could be felt pretty immediately. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=144.1s)]
*  We're already seeing oil prices spike in terms of the futures market at two percent, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=147.85999999999999s)]
*  since the president did announce this. And when oil prices go up, it's not just the gas [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=152.94s)]
*  pump. It's not just heating your home. It's everything. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=157.85999999999999s)]
*  It's always the canary in the coal mine when it comes to inflation. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=160.9s)]
*  So that makes me wonder the expected reaction from Wall Street this morning when [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=164.06s)]
*  markets open. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=171.01999999999998s)]
*  Oh, it's not good. So the futures market, the Dow was down, the Nasdaq, the S&P 500. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=172.02s)]
*  Really, this means that companies are going to have to pay more. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=179.78s)]
*  That's a hit on profits. I will say tariffs, they incentivize companies to bring [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=183.42000000000002s)]
*  manufacturing here, bring jobs here. But that also means that those companies will [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=188.10000000000002s)]
*  pay more. So the market investors are not liking this right now, Errol. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=191.86s)]
*  Yeah, I was hesitating to not say worry, but you cleared it out right there. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=195.06s)]
*  It's not good. Kelly Grady, thank you very much for that update. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=198.5s)]
*  For more on the international reaction to President Trump's tariffs, we're joined by [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=201.74s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Remy Anosensio from London, who has an extensive [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=204.74s)]
*  business reporting background as well. So, Remy, from your point of view, what is [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=208.66s)]
*  the reaction across the ocean to these pending tariffs? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=212.94s)]
*  Sure. Well, it is a downer of a day, regardless whether you're in Canada, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=218.14000000000001s)]
*  Mexico, China, here in the UK or in the European Union. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=223.22s)]
*  But I got to say, looking first at reaction out of Canada, when you get a [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=227.74s)]
*  Canadian angry, you know you've done something. Let's go ahead and roll this. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=232.54000000000002s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=236.42000000000002s)]
*  All right, so what you're seeing here are Canadian basketball fans booing the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=244.26000000000002s)]
*  Star-Spangled Banner. That's at an NBA game between the Toronto Raptors and the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=249.3s)]
*  Los Angeles Clippers. Something similar happened at a hockey game in Ottawa, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=253.46s)]
*  and this is showing how economics and politics are going into just normal day [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=257.54s)]
*  to day life. I got to say also that, you know, the U.S. and Canada share the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=262.54s)]
*  world's longest peaceful border, but with these Trump tariffs coming in, that [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=267.1s)]
*  peace definitely is being shaken. Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada now is saying [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=271.82000000000005s)]
*  that he will levy 25 percent tariffs on more than $150 billion worth of goods. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=277.22s)]
*  He listed out many of them, but not all of them. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=283.70000000000005s)]
*  Also, take a listen to this. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=286.54s)]
*  Like the American tariffs, our response will also be far reaching and include [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=288.66s)]
*  everyday items such as American beer, wine, and bourbon, fruits and fruit juices, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=294.54s)]
*  including orange juice, along with vegetables, perfume, clothing, and shoes. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=301.38s)]
*  It'll include major consumer products like household appliances, furniture and [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=307.98s)]
*  sports equipment, and materials like lumber and plastics, along with much, much more. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=313.06s)]
*  And that was just some of what he wanted to tell Americans, saying, you know, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=321.3s)]
*  you're going to be hit. He's also saying that Canada will be hit, but that it's [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=326.1s)]
*  something that retaliation just does have to happen. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=330.06s)]
*  The first round of these two rounds of tariffs happen at midnight, $30 billion [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=333.34000000000003s)]
*  on the first trench. And then in 21 days, he says another $125 million worth of US [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=338.53999999999996s)]
*  goods will then also be tariffed. That is to help Canadian companies try to figure [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=344.06s)]
*  out a new supply chain there. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=349.21999999999997s)]
*  Now, south to the border of the United States and Mexico is also saying that they're [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=351.34s)]
*  going to do their own countermeasures. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=355.78s)]
*  The president there, Claudia Scheinbaum, has issued a statement saying that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=358.09999999999997s)]
*  countermeasures will happen, that tariffs will happen. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=362.14s)]
*  She didn't say how much they will, but they're saying that they're talking also [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=364.38s)]
*  with their Canadian counterpart to try to do something together. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=368.53999999999996s)]
*  A little bit of an enemy of mine, an enemy of yours, brings us both together. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=371.14s)]
*  Also, not forgetting China, the big dragon in the room. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=377.34s)]
*  They are considering countermeasures of 10 percent, basically matching the same [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=381.17999999999995s)]
*  levies that Trump has said that he'll put on a number of Chinese goods. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=387.5s)]
*  Ministry of Commerce here saying that China strongly dissatisfied, firmly opposes [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=393.62s)]
*  this and that they're going to take this to the World Trade Organization. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=397.58000000000004s)]
*  I got to say that in being a former China correspondent, this is quite a muted [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=400.46000000000004s)]
*  response. They're definitely putting some kind of political angle to this, not [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=404.38s)]
*  trying to ruffle the feathers of this new incoming Trump administration, because [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=408.70000000000005s)]
*  they could, Trump definitely could do more. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=411.86s)]
*  Looking back to 2019, he did do that. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=414.54s)]
*  He raised to 25 percent the amount of tariffs that he applied to $200 billion [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=416.90000000000003s)]
*  worth of Chinese goods. And then on top of that, $300 billion for even more pain. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=422.7s)]
*  So China at this point, especially with China's economy not doing so well, they're [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=428.46s)]
*  trying to avoid even further pain there. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=432.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I'm still stunned by the national anthem being booed by Canadians. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=434.21999999999997s)]
*  You're right, Remy. It says so much. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=437.94s)]
*  We appreciate that update. Thank you. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=440.46s)]
*  Joining us from Britain. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OIIZeFO5I&t=442.06s)]
