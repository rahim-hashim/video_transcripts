*  While the president did not share [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=8.24s)]
*  the terms of this release, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=10.44s)]

*  with President Putin about the war in [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=14.44s)]
*  Ukraine. Take a listen to some of those remarks. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=17.0s)]
*  I think this could be the very important [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=22.16s)]
*  element. You could be a big part of it, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=24.62s)]
*  it could be a big important part of [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  getting the war over with Ukraine. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  And we appreciate President Putin's [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=32.68s)]
*  what he what he did. He was [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=35.239999999999995s)]
*  able to pull it off for you, right? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  He was able to pull it off. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  We think and you're here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=41.96s)]
*  I'm here. So it was great. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  Will tell you a little bit more about it tomorrow, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  but I think we've made great progress, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=48.44s)]
*  progress on the war also getting the war. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  I want to get the war ended. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=53.04s)]
*  And joining us again this today, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=54.52s)]
*  I was going to say this morning, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=56.52s)]
*  but I know it's noon in DC at this point. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=58.96s)]
*  So CBS News Chief White House [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=61.96s)]
*  correspondent Nancy Cortez. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=63.88s)]
*  She's joining us and Nancy Trump [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  remains tight-lipped about these [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=67.16s)]
*  negotiations, but he hinted to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=68.80000000000001s)]
*  several announcement he wants to make [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=70.68s)]
*  today, including a second potential [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=73.0s)]
*  prisoner release. Do we have any [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=75.0s)]
*  idea about who that could be? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=77.36s)]
*  We do not, and we have been asking. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=81.16s)]
*  We've been asking the White House. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=83.44s)]
*  We've been asking Stephen Witkoff, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=85.0s)]
*  his special envoy, who was actually [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=86.72s)]
*  the one who took his own private [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=88.64s)]
*  plane to go get Mark Fogel and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=90.52s)]
*  bring him back to the United States. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=92.44s)]
*  And no one has told us who that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=94.32s)]
*  second prisoner might be and even [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=98.32s)]
*  where they're being held. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=100.36s)]
*  Are they being held in Russia or [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=101.64s)]
*  are they being held somewhere else? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=103.16s)]
*  So we're still waiting for those [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  details and still trying to freak [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=106.84s)]
*  out, frankly, Mugo, how this all [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=108.64s)]
*  came together in the first place, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=110.88s)]
*  as you pointed out. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=112.52s)]
*  Yes, President Trump seemed to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=113.28s)]
*  suggest that he had worked closely [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=115.72s)]
*  with Vladimir Putin to make this [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=118.24s)]
*  happen, but he hasn't really said [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=120.08s)]
*  to what extent his advisors have [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=122.24s)]
*  been pretty tight lipped as well. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=124.24s)]
*  Stephen Witkoff, again, his special [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=126.28s)]
*  envoy, said that MBS, Mohammed bin [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  Salman, the crown prince of Saudi [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  Arabia was involved, perhaps [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=132.88s)]
*  brokering this deal. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=134.8s)]
*  It's unclear what his role was and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=135.88s)]
*  why he got involved. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=139.76s)]
*  So there's still a lot of unanswered [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=141.8s)]
*  questions that we hope to get some [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=143.4s)]
*  more clarity on at the White House [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=144.88000000000002s)]
*  press briefing today and perhaps even [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=146.56s)]
*  be able to ask the president about [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  this as well if he speaks to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=151.68s)]
*  reporters today. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=153.4s)]
*  And Nancy sources tell CBS News USAID [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=155.12s)]
*  Inspector General Paul Martin was [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=158.0s)]
*  fired by the White House on Tuesday. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  What more do we know about this? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  So this is a very interesting [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=166.4s)]
*  situation. You might recall a couple [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  of weeks ago that a whole swath of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=169.68s)]
*  about 18 inspectors general were [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=172.96s)]
*  fired all on the same Friday night. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=176.16s)]
*  No reason given. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  These are the individuals at each [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  of the agencies who really act as [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=184.16s)]
*  watchdogs within that agency to root [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=186.96s)]
*  out waste, fraud and abuse, the kinds [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=189.4s)]
*  of things that the Trump [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  administration has said are very [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=193.36s)]
*  important to them. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  This particular IG was still on the job. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=196.28s)]
*  He was not removed. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=198.96s)]
*  He was at USAID and he put out a pretty [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=200.0s)]
*  scathing report on Monday detailing the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=202.96s)]
*  fact that these massive cuts that have [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  taken place so quickly at USAID had [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=210.12s)]
*  actually put about half a billion [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  dollars worth of food assistance for [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=216.44s)]
*  other countries at risk of spoiling in [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=218.68s)]
*  warehouses and at ports. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  So in other words, he pointed to a great [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=223.44s)]
*  deal of waste that was taking place [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=226.84s)]
*  because of some of these cuts. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=228.16s)]
*  Within 24 hours, he was fired by the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=230.24s)]
*  Trump administration. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=232.56s)]
*  They didn't tell him why. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=233.84s)]
*  He got a two sentence email informing [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=235.04s)]
*  him that he would no longer be on the job. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=237.44s)]
*  All right, Nancy Cordes, thank you so [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=240.76s)]
*  much for your reporting today. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3BGWmS4hGM&t=242.44s)]
