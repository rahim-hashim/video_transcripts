# GOP Sen. Cassidy "struggling" with confirmation vote for RFK Jr. as HHS secretary
**CBS News:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY)
*  The nominations of some of President Trump's most controversial cabinet selections are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=0.0s)]
*  still up in the air at the moment. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=4.0600000000000005s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard and Cash Patel all faced questioning at their confirmation [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=5.94s)]
*  hearings. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=10.82s)]
*  Nominees were not only grilled by Democrats, but there were several tense exchanges with [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=12.02s)]
*  Republicans. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=15.02s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News congressional correspondent Nicole Killian, who's on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=16.02s)]
*  So Nicole, physician in Louisiana, Republican Senator Bill Cassidy says he is struggling [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=20.3s)]
*  to support Kennedy to lead the Department of Health and Human Services over his prior [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=24.740000000000002s)]
*  vaccine statements. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=28.779999999999998s)]
*  Could this one senator potentially impact Kennedy's chance at confirmation? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=30.24s)]
*  We yes and no. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=35.64s)]
*  Obviously, Senator Cassidy is a critical player in this in that he sits not only on the Senate [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=36.64s)]
*  Finance Committee, which held a confirmation hearing for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., but also [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=41.12s)]
*  on the Senate Health Committee as well, which held the second hearing this week with Mr. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=45.92s)]
*  Kennedy. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=50.96s)]
*  It is the Finance Committee, however, that will ultimately vote on whether his nomination [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=51.96s)]
*  should advance. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=57.16s)]
*  And in essence, Kennedy will need all the Republicans on the panel to remain unified [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=58.16s)]
*  for him to be able to advance. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=64.12s)]
*  So having that support will be critical. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  But that being said, you know, that's just the first hurdle. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=67.8s)]
*  Obviously, if his nomination does advance, there's also that full vote in the Senate. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=70.8s)]
*  You know, many Democrats have been concerned about Kennedy's nomination, even though at [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=76.2s)]
*  the outset there was talk that maybe he could get some bipartisan support. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=81.12s)]
*  But really, he will once again kind of need Republicans to stick together on his nomination. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=85.68s)]
*  And given that some have expressed some skepticism or questions about his views surrounding vaccines, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  that leaves his nomination somewhat questionable, although certainly the White House is confident [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=97.48s)]
*  and even called on the Senate today to swiftly move forward with confirming the president's [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=102.04s)]
*  nominees. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=107.2s)]
*  FBI Director nominee Cash Patel is long been a staunch ally to President Trump. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=108.2s)]
*  He broke with him yesterday on some January 6th pardons. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=112.36s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=114.92s)]
*  I have always rejected any violence against law enforcement. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=117.92s)]
*  And I have, including in that group, specifically addressed any violence against law enforcement [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  on January 6th. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=128.4s)]
*  And I do not agree with the commutation of any sentence of any individual who committed [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  violence against law enforcement. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=134.6s)]
*  This is someone who fundraised for nonviolent January 6th offenders and their families off [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=137.04s)]
*  a song called Justice for All. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=140.56s)]
*  He then distanced himself from the group and the song during his hearing. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=142.16s)]
*  Is that comment making waves? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, look, you know, I don't think his responses really sat well with a number of senators, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=147.12s)]
*  particularly the Democrats on the panel, who did try to poke holes in some of his past [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=152.92s)]
*  statements. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=159.12s)]
*  I mean, look, in terms of Cash Patel, he did try to portray himself as someone who is supportive [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=160.12s)]
*  of law enforcement, someone who will uphold the Constitution. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=164.1s)]
*  But the point that many Senate Democrats raised time and again is they felt that a lot of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=167.56s)]
*  his statements contradicted that, including his involvement in trying to fundraise for [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=171.76s)]
*  some of these January 6th defendants through this choir that he tried to distance himself [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=177.2s)]
*  from saying that he was just trying to help family members, that he didn't really have [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  a role or kind of any direct involvement in it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=188.22s)]
*  So that being said, most of the Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee did not [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  seem satisfied with Patel's answers, whereas many Republicans, even though they may have [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=195.95999999999998s)]
*  had some concerns about his previous statements and backgrounds, by and large seem more sympathetic [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=200.76s)]
*  to his nomination. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=206.92s)]
*  So again, we'll see how that vote plays out when it's held in the Judiciary Committee. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=208.92s)]
*  What about Tulsi Gabbard's hearing? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think that one is one that everybody's kind of watching, where it seems like her [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=215.48s)]
*  nomination could kind of go either way. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, she did actually have a number of tense exchanges with a number of not only [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  Democratic senators, but Republican senators as well in terms of her views about the intelligence [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=227.92s)]
*  community and also, you know, her past statements and views as well with respect to Russia and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  Syria. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=239.67999999999998s)]
*  You know, one senator asked her if she would give Russia a pass, and she almost seemed [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=240.67999999999998s)]
*  insulted by that question, saying, you know, that she wouldn't do that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=244.1s)]
*  But one of the real sticking points was when she was asked about former NSA leader Edward [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=248.23999999999998s)]
*  Snowden, and she was pushed to say whether or not she believes he was a traitor, and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=253.88s)]
*  she would not go so far as to say that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=258.36s)]
*  Even Republican James Langford, who appeared supportive of Gabbard's bid, seemed surprised [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=261.4s)]
*  and taken back by her answer. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=266.96s)]
*  So that is one nomination that does remain in doubt. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=268.8s)]
*  Nicole Killian, thank you. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfLHYwxNOoY&t=272.24s)]
