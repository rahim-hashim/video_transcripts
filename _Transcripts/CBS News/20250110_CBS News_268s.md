# Death toll grows in Southern California as fires continue to rage
**CBS News:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ)
*  At least 10 people are confirmed dead and more than 10,000 structures have burned across [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=0.0s)]
*  the Los Angeles area as a result of multiple catastrophic wildfires. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=5.74s)]
*  Emergency crews are working around the clock to contain the flames, which have continued [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=10.68s)]
*  burning as a result of powerful winds. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  More than 150,000 people in the Los Angeles area are under evacuation orders across LA [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=17.7s)]
*  County. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=23.82s)]
*  Officials say firefighters have made some progress against the five major wildfires [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=24.82s)]
*  burning in the area. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=29.48s)]
*  But tensions... [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=31.16s)]
*  L.A.F.D. battled all night on the Palisades fire, the Hearst fire, the Kenneth fire, and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  airdrop efforts, thank goodness, continue. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=37.8s)]
*  L.A.F.D. also responded to and extinguished fires in Pacoima, Hollywood, Studio City and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=40.92s)]
*  more. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=47.36s)]
*  But tensions remain high as firefighters continue to battle these blazes in the area. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=48.72s)]
*  Many residents have reported getting false or inaccurate evacuation warnings, which officials [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=56.36s)]
*  are working quickly, they say, to address. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=62.08s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Elise Preston is reporting on the ground in Santa Monica, California. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=65.08s)]
*  I see you there, Elise. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=69.4s)]
*  What is the situation like right now? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=71.08s)]
*  Well, we are in Santa Monica. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=73.48s)]
*  This is the Pacific Coast Highway, Lana, and back right behind me is the Palisade fire. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=76.76s)]
*  That is one of the most dangerous ones that is still burning. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=81.32s)]
*  It's been one of the most destructive of these five fires, and it's only 8% contained. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  You can see that thick haze that's behind me that's just kind of hovering in the horizon. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=90.2s)]
*  That is smoke from the fire as firefighters work tirelessly to get those flames out that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=95.56s)]
*  have been kicked up by winds. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=101.36s)]
*  Now, the winds are expected to die down, but then expected to kick back up on Sunday, causing [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=103.04s)]
*  a lot of trouble here. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=108.44s)]
*  Now, along this Pacific Coast Highway, the only vehicles that are allowed in and out [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=110.6s)]
*  are emergency personnel of some type. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=115.16s)]
*  So you have to show some type of credential or be like a law enforcement agent or a fire [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=118.16s)]
*  vehicle. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=124.12s)]
*  Those are the only ones that we're seeing pass along this Pacific Coast Highway. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=125.12s)]
*  The other danger here in Southern California, Lana, is not just these flames. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  It's not the winds that are carrying the flames and embers, but they've created such [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=136.0s)]
*  a poor air quality. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=140.64s)]
*  You see I'm talking to you with a mask. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=142.68s)]
*  After several days of being out here, it does feel like my throat and chest feels raspy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=145.16s)]
*  My eye drops. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=151.4s)]
*  I'm so thankful that our audio engineer, Steve Miller, he shared some eye drops with me today. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=152.4s)]
*  I've been putting them in all morning long because the air is burning my eyes. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=156.84s)]
*  So there's a lot of concern for Angelenos who even if they're not necessarily in the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=162.78s)]
*  danger zone with their home. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=168.5s)]
*  And Elise, continue to be safe out there and a good reminder for anybody in the area that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=171.34s)]
*  the water or that the air quality is so poor, officials are saying you need to be wearing [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=177.26s)]
*  masks. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=182.14s)]
*  But let's talk specifically about fire containment because there are five different fires. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=183.14s)]
*  The palisades in particular, emergency crews have had little success containing. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=187.78s)]
*  Talk to us about some of the biggest issues that they're encountering and how the winds [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=193.22s)]
*  have contributed to the problem. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=196.76s)]
*  Yeah, those winds have been very tricky. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=199.02s)]
*  These are winds that people have not seen that they have not dealt with before. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=202.32s)]
*  And so as a result, they have been very tricky for firefighters to try to fight these flames. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=206.22s)]
*  We have been able to get into that palisade area. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=212.7s)]
*  We're not able to get a live signal out to you. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=216.94000000000003s)]
*  So that's why we're so far. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=218.78s)]
*  This is the closest vantage point that we could get with a live signal. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=220.18s)]
*  You can hear I don't know if you can hear a lot of but there's actually a chopper above [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=224.66000000000003s)]
*  me that it just kind of flew over just now. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=228.46s)]
*  So you might have lost my audio, but I can hear that chopper. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=230.86s)]
*  Now they're able to get up with air support and do drops. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=234.46s)]
*  That was not possible a couple of days ago because the wind was so strong. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=237.86s)]
*  It was so fierce. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=242.78000000000003s)]
*  We're talking about 100 mile per hour hurricane force winds. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=243.78s)]
*  Now we're starting to see the fire department make those drops, right? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=247.94s)]
*  But they were not able to do that because of the wind. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=251.86s)]
*  When you talk about that danger, it's expected to die down at six, but then kick back up [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=255.02s)]
*  on Sunday into Monday and Tuesday. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=261.26s)]
*  All right, Elise Preston. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=263.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHBABOICqOQ&t=265.14s)]
