# RFK Jr. asked to explain vaccine stance, pressed about measles outbreak in Samoa
**CBS News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA)
*  Mr. Kennedy, you have spent years pushing conflicting stories about vaccines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=0.0s)]
*  You say one thing and then you say another. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  In your testimony today under oath, you denied that you were anti-vaccine. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  But during a podcast interview in July of 2023, you said, quote, no vaccine is safe [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=16.34s)]
*  and effective. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=22.72s)]
*  In your testimony today, in order to prove you're not anti-vax, you note that all your [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=24.28s)]
*  kids are vaccinated. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  But in a podcast in 2020, you said, and I quote, you would do anything, pay anything [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=32.6s)]
*  to go back in time and not vaccinate your kids. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=40.08s)]
*  Mr. Kennedy, all of these things cannot be true. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=44.24s)]
*  So are you lying to Congress today when you say you are pro-vaccine or did you lie on [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=51.2s)]
*  all those podcasts? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=57.92s)]
*  We have all of this on tape, by the way. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=59.32000000000001s)]
*  Senator, as you know, because it's been repeatedly debunked, that statement that I made on the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=62.36s)]
*  Lekas Friedman podcast was a fragment of the statement. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=69.16s)]
*  He asked me, and anybody who actually goes and looks at that podcast will see this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  He asked me, are there vaccines that are safe and effective? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=80.16s)]
*  And I said to him, some of the live virus vaccines are. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=83.08s)]
*  And I said, there are no vaccines that are safe and effective. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=87.24s)]
*  And I was going to continue for every person. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=90.56s)]
*  Every medicine has people who are sensitive to them, including vaccines. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=93.88s)]
*  So he interrupted me at that point. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=99.0s)]
*  I've corrected it many times, including on national TV. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=101.96s)]
*  You know about this, Senator Wyden. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=105.56s)]
*  So bringing this up right now is dishonest. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=107.32s)]
*  Let's be clear about what you've actually done then since you want to deny your statements. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=110.08s)]
*  For example, you have a history of trying to take vaccines away from people. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=116.8s)]
*  In May of 2021, you petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to not only block Americans [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=123.24s)]
*  from having access to the COVID vaccine, but to prevent any future access to the lifesaving [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=129.76s)]
*  vaccine. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=138.0s)]
*  Are you denying that? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=139.0s)]
*  It is on the petition. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=140.92s)]
*  We brought that petition after CDC recommended the COVID vaccine without any scientific basis. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=142.28s)]
*  For six-year-old children, most experts agree today, even the people who did it back then, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=152.12s)]
*  that COVID vaccines are inappropriate for six-year-old children who basically have a [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=160.68s)]
*  zero risk from COVID. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=165.48s)]
*  That's why I brought that lawsuit. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=168.32s)]
*  I want to emphasize this. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=170.4s)]
*  Mr. Kennedy, the facts... [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=172.4s)]
*  The facts... [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=174.4s)]
*  The committee will be in order. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=176.4s)]
*  And to the audience. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=184.4s)]
*  Senator Kondler, I'm most happy to hold on for a second, Mr. Kennedy. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=188.4s)]
*  To the audience. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=192.92s)]
*  The comments from the audience are inappropriate and out of order. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=195.32s)]
*  And if there are any further disruptions, the committee will recess until the police [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  can restore order. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=203.22s)]
*  Please follow the rules of the committee. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=206.04s)]
*  Mr. Kennedy, you may proceed. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=208.48s)]
*  I also want to point out that your recitation of what happened in Samoa is absolutely wrong. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=209.88s)]
*  And you know it's wrong. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=217.88s)]
*  And you know it's wrong. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=218.88s)]
*  We'll get to that in a moment. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=219.88s)]
*  Right now we're talking about the petition that you filed to block Americans from having [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=221.94s)]
*  access to the vaccine and to prevent any future access to the vaccine. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=227.1s)]
*  Those facts are on the record. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=232.82s)]
*  My third question to you is you made almost $5 million from book deals, mostly promoting [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=234.66s)]
*  junk science. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=241.74s)]
*  In 2021, in a book called The Measles Book, you wrote that parents had been, quote, misled [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=242.74s)]
*  into believing that measles is a deadly disease and that measles vaccines are necessary, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=247.98s)]
*  safe and effective. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=253.34s)]
*  The reality is measles are in fact deadly and highly contagious, something that you [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=254.34s)]
*  should have learned after your lives contributed to the deaths of 83 people, most of them children, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=259.74s)]
*  in a measles outbreak in Samoa. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=266.58s)]
*  So my question here is, Mr. Kennedy, is measles deadly? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=268.58s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=273.06s)]
*  The death rate from measles historically in this country in 1963, the year before the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=275.38s)]
*  introduction of the vaccine, was one in 10,000. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=282.42s)]
*  Let me explain what happened in Samoa. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=286.3s)]
*  In Samoa in 2017 or 2015, there were two kids who died following the MMR vaccine. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=288.9s)]
*  Vaccination rates in Samoa dropped precipitously from about 63% to the mid-30s, so they'd never [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=301.06s)]
*  been very high. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=306.02s)]
*  And in 2018, two more kids died following the MMR vaccine and the government in Samoa [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=308.06s)]
*  banned the MMR vaccine. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=313.42s)]
*  I arrived a year later when vaccination rates were already below any previous level. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=315.54s)]
*  I went there, nothing to do with vaccines. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=324.34000000000003s)]
*  I went there to introduce a medical informatics system that would digitalize records in Samoa [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=327.06s)]
*  and make health delivery much more efficient. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=333.18s)]
*  I never gave any public statement about vaccines. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=336.18s)]
*  You cannot find a single Samoan who will say, I didn't get a vaccine because of Bobby Kennedy. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=339.85999999999996s)]
*  I went in June of 2019. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=347.82s)]
*  The measles outbreak started in August. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=349.82s)]
*  Oh, clearly I had nothing to do with the measles. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=352.09999999999997s)]
*  Not only that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=355.02s)]
*  Senator, not only that, if you let me finish. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=356.02s)]
*  You have had some time and I'm going to respond. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=358.9s)]
*  If you let me finish, Senator, if you let me finish, 83 people died when the tissue [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=362.41999999999996s)]
*  samples were sent to New Zealand. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=367.85999999999996s)]
*  Most of those people did not have measles. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=371.53999999999996s)]
*  We don't know what was killing them. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=373.65999999999997s)]
*  The same outbreak occurred in Tonga and Fiji and no extra people died. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=375.53999999999996s)]
*  There were seven measles outbreaks in the 13 years prior to my arrival. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=380.09999999999997s)]
*  I would like to get my time back. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=383.82s)]
*  The nominee wrote a book saying that people had been misled into believing that measles [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=386.98s)]
*  is a deadly disease. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=393.02s)]
*  He's trying now to play down his role in Samoa. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=394.65999999999997s)]
*  That's not what the parents say. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=397.38s)]
*  That's not what Governor Green says. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=398.64s)]
*  It's time to make sure that we blow the whistle on actually what your views are. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=400.58s)]
*  At least we're starting. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=404.82s)]
*  We need to move on. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=406.53999999999996s)]
*  Senator, I support the measles vaccine. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=407.53999999999996s)]
*  I support the polio vaccine. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=409.46s)]
*  I will do nothing as HHS secretary. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=411.26s)]
*  That makes it difficult or discourages people from taking either of those vaccines. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=415.06s)]
*  Anybody who believes that ought to look at the measles book you wrote saying parents [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=418.9s)]
*  have been misled into believing that measles is a deadly disease. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=423.21999999999997s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=427.21999999999997s)]
*  We need to move on. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=428.62s)]
*  Senator Grassley. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcx1_rndaA&t=429.94s)]
