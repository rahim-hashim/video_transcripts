# What does Trump's new immigration executive order mean?
**CBS News:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU)
*  President Donald Trump has put an end to diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in the federal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=0.0s)]
*  government. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=4.84s)]
*  All federal DEI employees were put on paid leave at 5 p.m. Wednesday in accordance with [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=5.84s)]
*  a memo sent from the White House, first obtained by CBS News. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=10.72s)]
*  The memo also calls for offices to set a complete list of employees impacted and for the cancellation [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=14.4s)]
*  of all DEI-related trainings. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=20.0s)]
*  The Justice Department is also beginning to enforce some of President Trump's immigration [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=22.76s)]
*  and border security plans. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=26.84s)]
*  The active Deputy Attorney General has directed employees to step up immigration law enforcement [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=28.76s)]
*  and investigate any state or local officials trying to impede the Trump administration's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=33.96s)]
*  immigration initiatives. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=38.36s)]
*  White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt said President Trump is also ordering military [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=40.28s)]
*  backup. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=44.040000000000006s)]
*  President Trump signed an executive order of 1,500 additional troops to the United States [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  southern border. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=50.08s)]
*  This comes off of his day one action, as I just talked about, on Fox News to direct [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=51.08s)]
*  the Department of Defense to make homeland security a core mission of the agency. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=54.4s)]
*  This is something President Trump campaigned on. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  The American people have been waiting for such a time as this. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=61.16s)]
*  CBS News political reporter Olivia Rinaldi joins me now. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=65.4s)]
*  Olivia, what are the actions on immigration that President Trump is taking and how is [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=68.0s)]
*  he planning to enforce them? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=71.28s)]
*  Yeah, Lindsay, it's good to be with you. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=72.6s)]
*  The Pentagon is already acting on some of those executive orders that Trump signed within [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=74.68s)]
*  his first few hours in office on Monday. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=78.56s)]
*  So we're just learning now that about 1,500 active duty troops will be sent to the southern [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=82.56s)]
*  border. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  We are also hearing from senior military officials just a short while ago that those 1,500 service [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  members will be coming from San Diego and El Paso, and about 1,000 of them are Army [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=92.84s)]
*  personnel and about 500 are Marines. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=98.12s)]
*  Not only will they be sent to the border, but there will also be these airlift missions [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=101.36s)]
*  that are expected to help the Department of Homeland Security in deporting some of these [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=106.0s)]
*  people that are in custody from Customs and Border Patrol. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=110.16s)]
*  So military being used in active deportations and enforcing security at the U.S. southern [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  border. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=121.52s)]
*  Very, very major news today. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=122.52s)]
*  Let's talk about the D.I. memorandum. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=125.08s)]
*  Do we have any sense of the impact that's going to have? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  Well, that memorandum went into effect today at 5 p.m. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=129.12s)]
*  So we know that essentially all federal employees that are part of what they're calling diversity, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=133.24s)]
*  equity and inclusion roles within the federal government were placed on leave today by 5 [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=139.32s)]
*  p.m. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=145.04s)]
*  We're also learning that the White House is asking agencies to submit a written plan for [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=146.04s)]
*  executing a reduction in this workforce regarding all of these employees that are now on leave [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  by next Friday. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=156.76s)]
*  So deciding what to do with all these people who are on leave, deciding that by next Friday, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=158.5s)]
*  we don't exactly know the scope of this just yet. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=163.44s)]
*  There are lawyers in every agency working to determine what a D.E.I. role actually is. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=166.36s)]
*  Is that someone who works in H.R.? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=172.08s)]
*  Who perhaps does some work with D.E.I.? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=174.44000000000003s)]
*  Or is it someone who specifically focuses on all of this? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=176.88000000000002s)]
*  So I expect in the coming weeks and days, we're going to learn just the scope of how many [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=180.56s)]
*  people are on leave, how many people have been fired, and really the impact of this [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=184.18s)]
*  executive order. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=188.78000000000003s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=189.78000000000003s)]
*  We'll hear more from you, Olivia Rinaldi. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=190.78000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=191.78000000000003s)]
*  As we mentioned, many of President Trump's immigration and border plans are being implemented. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=193.22s)]
*  U.S. border agents have been ordered to deport migrants attempting to enter the U.S. illegally [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=197.34s)]
*  without allowing them to request legal protection. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=201.86s)]
*  That's according to internal government documents and agency officials. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=204.58s)]
*  President Trump invoked several executive orders that dramatically overhaul immigration [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=208.26s)]
*  law. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=212.02s)]
*  They include expedited deportations beyond border areas and the end of birthright citizenship, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=213.02s)]
*  which guarantees a child born in the U.S. is a citizen, even if their parents weren't. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=217.5s)]
*  CBS News immigration and politics reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez has exclusive reporting [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=222.38s)]
*  on all this for us. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=227.46s)]
*  Camilo, what else can you tell us about these border agents' new instructions and how it [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=228.66s)]
*  differs from previous policy? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=232.3s)]
*  Hi, Lindsay. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=233.86s)]
*  Soon after taking office, President Trump invoked sweeping powers under the U.S. Constitution [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=235.14s)]
*  and U.S. immigration law to suspend the entry of most asylum seekers and unauthorized migrants [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=239.68s)]
*  at the U.S.-Mexico border, at the U.S.-Canada border, and in coastal sectors like Florida. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=245.98s)]
*  And that effectively has allowed Customs and Border Protection now to gain the power to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=252.26s)]
*  quickly and expeditiously deport migrants without hearing their asylum claims. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=258.08s)]
*  According to internal guidance that we obtained here at CBS News, border patrol agents have [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=263.76s)]
*  been directed to swiftly deport these people to Mexico or to their home countries without [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=268.14s)]
*  screening them for asylum or allowing them to have a case in immigration court. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=273.44s)]
*  And that is a major pivot from longstanding practice because traditionally the U.S. has [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=278.2s)]
*  been obligated, Lindsay, to hear the cases of people who ask for asylum because under [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=283.32s)]
*  U.S. and international refugee law, those are designed, those safety guards are designed [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=288.88s)]
*  to prevent people from being deported to places where they could be persecuted. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=294.84s)]
*  So this is a major shift that the president is saying is justified because he is arguing [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=299.84s)]
*  in these executive orders, Lindsay, that there is currently an invasion at the U.S.-Mexico [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=305.28s)]
*  border and that unauthorized migrants are posing a public health and national security [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=310.17999999999995s)]
*  risk to the nation. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=315.06s)]
*  What more can you tell us about these troops who are expected to go to the border soon? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=316.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, we understand that the active duty soldiers that are being deployed to the U.S.-Mexico [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=320.0s)]
*  border are being sent there to provide operational and logistical assistance to U.S. customs [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=325.2s)]
*  and border protection. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=331.0s)]
*  That of course could include the construction of the border wall, which the president has [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=332.4s)]
*  restarted after the Biden administration halted that multibillion-dollar construction project [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=337.2s)]
*  by the U.S. federal government. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=342.52s)]
*  But we also know that currently under longstanding law, the military, Lindsay, is prevented from [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=344.52s)]
*  in civilian law enforcement, and that includes the enforcement of federal immigration law. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=352.16s)]
*  So they are not supposed to be detaining, apprehending, or otherwise processing migrants. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=356.32000000000005s)]
*  Importantly, it was also announced today, Lindsay, that the military will be assisting [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=361.8s)]
*  the Department of Homeland Security in deporting at least 5,000 migrants currently detained [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=366.64000000000004s)]
*  at the border to their home countries, including Mexico and other nations in the Western Hemisphere. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=372.32000000000005s)]
*  That is a major shift in policy. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=378.46000000000004s)]
*  What is the president of Mexico saying about this? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=380.68s)]
*  Well, the president of Mexico is saying that she will have to work with the new administration [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=383.56s)]
*  to really oversee what has traditionally been a very challenging issue for both countries, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=389.76s)]
*  the issue of migration. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=397.62s)]
*  And to be frank, Lindsay, the U.S. has long relied on the Mexican government to really [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=399.2s)]
*  outsource immigration enforcement. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=405.04s)]
*  The only reason, the main reason rather, that illegal border crossings dropped last [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=407.2s)]
*  year was because of Mexican efforts to interdict migrants. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=411.44s)]
*  And now Mexico will continue to play a major and pivotal role in immigration enforcement [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=414.28s)]
*  under President Trump because they will have to accept migrants who are not accepted by [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=419.48s)]
*  other countries like Venezuela. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=423.88s)]
*  Camila Montoya-Galvez, thank you. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=425.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo6Q7MJCOcU&t=428.15999999999997s)]
