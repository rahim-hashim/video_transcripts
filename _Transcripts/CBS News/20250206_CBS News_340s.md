# Judges block deadline for Trump's deferred resignation plan, birthright citizenship executive order
**CBS News:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM)
*  Judges have blocked two of President Trump's most controversial executive actions. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight's deadline for federal workers to accept a so-called buyout offer is now on hold, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=5.44s)]
*  and a hearing is set for Monday. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=10.64s)]
*  A source tells CBS News at least 40,000 workers have already accepted the deferred resignation, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=12.72s)]
*  which looks to shrink the federal workforce. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  And a federal judge in Seattle blocked President Trump's order to end birthright citizenship. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=21.44s)]
*  It's the second judge in two days to rule that order is unconstitutional. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=26.6s)]
*  Some Democrats are worried the nation's top weather agency is the next target for [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=31.0s)]
*  Elon Musk's efficiency department. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=35.24s)]
*  Former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials tell CBS News that [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=37.64s)]
*  NOAA is expecting its staffing to be cut in half. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=41.96s)]
*  Today, President Trump is calling for a task force to investigate what he called the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=45.64s)]
*  targeting of Christians while attending the annual National Prayer Breakfast in [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=49.32s)]
*  He said Americans need more religion. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=54.28s)]
*  CBS News' senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe joins us now. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=68.28s)]
*  Ed, if you want to weigh in on that comment, feel free. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=72.2s)]
*  But these two core decisions in the last hour are putting the brakes on some of President [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=74.44s)]
*  Trump's moves to reshape the federal workforce and immigration policy. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=79.4s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=82.68s)]
*  That's right, Lindsey. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=83.80000000000001s)]
*  We're getting a living, breathing example of checks and balances at work. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=84.60000000000001s)]
*  Let's start with the Boston federal district court decision that pushes the deadline for [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=87.48s)]
*  these deferred resignation offers or buyouts, payouts, whatever you prefer to call them, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=92.84s)]
*  until at least Monday afternoon. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=98.04s)]
*  The judge in Boston asking that it be held up until then. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=99.72s)]
*  Those that were suing include a series of federal worker labor unions called on the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=104.12s)]
*  Office of Personnel Management based here in Washington, the HR office based in the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=108.92000000000002s)]
*  federal government to send out a new email informing the nation's roughly 2 million [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=112.44s)]
*  civilian federal employees that this deadline is being put off until at least Monday afternoon. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  OPM is expected to send that in a little bit. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=121.56s)]
*  Then there's the birthright citizenship case of federal district judge in Seattle, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=124.84s)]
*  a Reagan appointee, a guy named John Kuhnauer writing a little while ago in his decision, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=128.76s)]
*  quote, the president has implied the rule of law has become something to navigate around and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=133.8s)]
*  ignore. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=138.28s)]
*  In this courtroom and under my law, the rule of law is a bright beacon that I intend to follow. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=139.16s)]
*  I refuse to let that beacon go dark today. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=143.48s)]
*  Birthright citizenship is a fundamental constitutional right. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=145.56s)]
*  The 14th Amendment guarantees the rights of citizenship. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=148.6s)]
*  We're all citizens subject to the right of law. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=151.16s)]
*  A constitutional amendment under the guise of an executive order is equally unconstitutional. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=153.24s)]
*  The judge writes they want to change birthright citizenship. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=157.88s)]
*  They will need to change the U.S. Constitution. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=160.76s)]
*  It is clearly unconstitutional. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  The preliminary injunction is granted on a nationwide basis. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=164.76s)]
*  So that is also on hold. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=167.4s)]
*  As you mentioned, a Maryland district court judge had also blocked the birthright citizenship move [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=168.76000000000002s)]
*  just yesterday. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  But again, all of these orders that the president has issued, most of them at this point, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  are being challenged in one way or another in court. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=178.44s)]
*  And it's a reminder that he moved quickly to get these things on the books, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=181.0s)]
*  knowing that legal challenges would likely come, in essence, inviting them. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=185.16s)]
*  And so we will await formal reaction from the Trump administration or from the president himself [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=189.4s)]
*  to these decisions. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=194.36s)]
*  Not entirely surprising, but a good reminder to those, perhaps, who are somewhat shocked [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=195.64s)]
*  by what's been going on the last several weeks, that this is the way the federal system works. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  The president can try to do something. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=203.39999999999998s)]
*  People can sue to slow it or stop it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=204.67999999999998s)]
*  And those processes are underway, at least in those two cases. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=206.76s)]
*  Quite a blistering quote you read. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=210.04s)]
*  Back to the federal worker deadline. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=211.32s)]
*  Do we know what happens to the 40,000 people who have already accepted the so-called buyout? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=213.64s)]
*  We don't. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=218.76s)]
*  And remember, it's at least 40,000. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=219.16s)]
*  In fact, in the case in Boston, Justice Department lawyers said tens of thousands [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=221.16s)]
*  of employees had accepted the offer to essentially be paid to stay home through the end of the fiscal [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=226.2s)]
*  year and then move on. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=232.76s)]
*  And they're welcome to, under this current arrangement, seek other employment in the meantime. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=235.4s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=241.48s)]
*  We're awaiting the text of whatever email it is that will go out to these federal employees, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=242.04s)]
*  telling them that the deadline is off. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  Remember, those unions had been advising federal employees not to take the offer because there was [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=248.84s)]
*  no legal guarantee yet, no budgetary authority for it, despite the assurances that had been [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=254.12s)]
*  sent in multiple emails in some cases to employees at various agencies encouraging them to take it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=259.8s)]
*  The White House is trying to clarify the president's plan to take over Gaza. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=265.88s)]
*  What are they saying? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, none other than the president's trying to clarify it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=270.44s)]
*  In fact, in a Truth Social post overnight, Lindsay, he wrote in part that Gaza Strip [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=273.08s)]
*  would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=277.64s)]
*  He says later, the U.S. working with great development teams from all over the world would [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=282.2s)]
*  slowly and carefully begin the construction of what would become one of the greatest and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=285.96s)]
*  most spectacular developments of its kind on Earth. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=289.72s)]
*  No soldiers by the U.S. would be needed. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=292.6s)]
*  Stability for the region would reign. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  Important to point out, yesterday, the press secretary and other officials suggested that [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  instead of a permanent resettlement of those in Gaza, as the president initially suggested, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=301.48s)]
*  instead it would be the temporary relocation of people while the Gaza Strip was rebuilt. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=306.44s)]
*  Who would pay for it? How would that be done? When could they return? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=311.32000000000005s)]
*  Who's paying for all this? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=314.44s)]
*  And if not U.S. troops, whose troops potentially to secure the area? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=315.96000000000004s)]
*  Also, to what extent would Israel be involved? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=320.28000000000003s)]
*  All of that unclear. It's all part of a Trump administration push [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=322.6s)]
*  to try to resolve the war between Israel and Hamas and the situation in the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=326.52000000000004s)]
*  As several administration officials said yesterday, the president's trying to push [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=331.32000000000005s)]
*  them outside the box thinking, and he's certainly done so. Lindsay? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=335.24s)]
*  At O'Keeffe, thank you. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRNBd0TyM&t=338.36s)]
