# What happened after the Trump-Zelenskyy heated exchange?
**CBS News:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs)
*  Now I want to bring back Chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett for more context [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=0.0s)]
*  here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=5.84s)]
*  Major, we're just learning the White House has said that after the meeting, the Ukrainian [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=6.84s)]
*  officials left the Oval Office in a separated room. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=10.8s)]
*  And it sounds like they were holding, waiting to see if they could reengage in some conversations [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=15.08s)]
*  that didn't happen, and essentially they were escorted out. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=20.16s)]
*  Based on your reporting, is that pretty extraordinary? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=23.88s)]
*  Very. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=26.96s)]
*  It's a for the moment, and President Trump can and does sometimes change his mind and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=28.6s)]
*  perspective. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=34.8s)]
*  This could be put back together. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=35.8s)]
*  But for the moment, it is a significant, hard to repair breach in relations between President [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=37.28s)]
*  Zelensky and President Trump. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=43.68s)]
*  And why was Zelensky here? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=46.6s)]
*  He was here because through this week, there had been a negotiating process that we were [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=49.36s)]
*  That would be an important linkage of the two countries. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=54.6s)]
*  And the Trump administration saw within that agreement not only a way to recoup some of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=64.8s)]
*  the money sent to Ukraine, it's not anywhere near as much as President Trump says, he always [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=69.8s)]
*  says 350 billion, it's much closer to 120 billion, but this would be a way to recoup [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=73.88s)]
*  some of that, a priority for President Trump. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=79.16s)]
*  And the Ukrainians agreed that that linkage, economically and otherwise, would be a de facto [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=84.0s)]
*  way of the United States saying, we're here with Ukraine, and this is an implied security [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=90.08s)]
*  guarantee. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=95.4s)]
*  This was very important for the Ukrainians to establish. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=96.64s)]
*  The terms were negotiated all this week. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=99.36s)]
*  They were more favorable to Ukraine than the original proposition that came from the Trump [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=101.8s)]
*  administration, but they were going to put this deal together. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=105.6s)]
*  Now that appears to be off for the time being. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=109.28s)]
*  President Trump is quite clearly using that as leverage over the Ukrainians, not only [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  in the context of whatever may be negotiated to end this war, but continued U.S. involvement [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=117.8s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=123.16s)]
*  So the president's terms are now clear. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=124.64s)]
*  If President Zelensky leaves Washington and goes back to Ukraine, he will not be welcomed [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=128.0s)]
*  back to the White House until the terms have become even more favorable to the administration, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=132.4s)]
*  less favorable to Ukraine. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=137.88000000000002s)]
*  So these next few hours will be crucial in determining whether any of this can be repaired [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=139.72s)]
*  or at least a semblance of patching the back together can be begun. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  OK, Major Garrett, thank you so much. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVqTGEb7Vbs&t=148.84s)]
