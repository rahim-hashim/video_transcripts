# Winter storm brings heavy snow, freezing rain to southern U.S.
**CBS News:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvai0IMc-ZM)
*  Right now a brutal winter storm is bringing heavy snow and freezing rain to the south and central U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvai0IMc-ZM&t=0.0s)]
*  This video next to me is from Texas and you see the roads there have just been covered making things slick and dangerous. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvai0IMc-ZM&t=7.0s)]
*  Winter storm warning stretch all the way from Texas to North and South Carolina. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvai0IMc-ZM&t=13.0s)]
*  That's the close up look but we want to show you the weather radar to give you a sense of just how big this system is. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvai0IMc-ZM&t=17.0s)]
*  As much as eight inches of snow could fall across the south through tomorrow. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvai0IMc-ZM&t=24.0s)]
*  Skyler Henry is in Atlanta where there's now a state of emergency in place. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvai0IMc-ZM&t=28.0s)]
*  Hey there. Good morning. As snow comes down here in metro Atlanta an arctic blast is sending parts of the south into a state of emergency with winter storm warning spanning from parts of Texas to the Carolinas. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvai0IMc-ZM&t=33.0s)]
*  Just Thursday we saw freezing rain snow sleet all slammed down onto parts of Texas forcing more than 1500 flights at the Dallas Fort Worth airport to either be delayed or canceled. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvai0IMc-ZM&t=47.0s)]
*  In Arkansas we also saw some winter weather advisories as well even in Oklahoma. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvai0IMc-ZM&t=62.0s)]
*  And many people here in the state of Georgia say that they are concerned about what happened back in 2014 in terms of that major winter storm that shut down several parts of interstates around the metro Atlanta area as well as into north Georgia. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvai0IMc-ZM&t=69.0s)]
*  We have spoken with Department of Transportation officials here in the state who say that they have been preparing for this for days with brine and salt mixtures on the roadways to try to make sure that everyone who is traveling on the roadways are as safe as possible. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvai0IMc-ZM&t=83.0s)]
*  But they are urging people if you do not have to travel in these conditions to stay at home because they say that it will be like this for at least the next 24 hours and they say that they will be working around the clock to make sure that everyone is as safe as possible. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvai0IMc-ZM&t=99.0s)]
*  Skyler Henry CBS News Atlanta back to you. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvai0IMc-ZM&t=115.0s)]
*  Skyler thank you for that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvai0IMc-ZM&t=118.0s)]
