# Warren pushes RFK Jr. on potential financial conflicts of interest as HHS secretary
**CBS News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik)
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So, Mr. Kennedy, I want to start with something that I think [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=0.0s)]
*  you and I agree on, and that is that Big Pharma has too much power in Washington. You said [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=3.96s)]
*  that President Trump asked you to, quote, clean up corruption and conflicts. Sounds [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=11.08s)]
*  great. You've said that you will, quote, slam shut the revolving door between government [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=17.68s)]
*  agencies and the companies they regulate. That also sounds great. So here's an easy [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=24.08s)]
*  question. Will you commit that when you leave this job, you will not accept compensation [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  from a drug company, a medical device company, a hospital system, or a health insurer for [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=35.32s)]
*  at least four years, including as a lobbyist or a board member? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  Can you just repeat the last part of the question? Can I commit to what? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=46.2s)]
*  You're not going to take money from drug companies in any way, shape, or form. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  Me? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  Yes, you. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=54.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I'm happy to commit to that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=55.28s)]
*  Good. That's what I figured. I said it's an easy question to start with. And I think [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=58.32s)]
*  you're right on this question. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=63.88s)]
*  I don't think any of them want to give me money, by the way. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=65.12s)]
*  Let's keep going. You're right to say yes, because every American has the right to know [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=68.08s)]
*  that every decision you make as our number one health officer is to help them and not [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=75.48s)]
*  to make money for yourself in the future. So I want to talk more about money. I'm looking [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=82.24s)]
*  at your paperwork right now. In the past two years, you've raked in two and a half million [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  dollars from a law firm called WisnerBomb. You go online, you do commercials to encourage [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=93.44s)]
*  people to sign up with WisnerBomb to join lawsuits against vaccine makers. And for everyone [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=100.16s)]
*  who signs up, you personally get paid. And if they win their case, you get 10 percent [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=107.24s)]
*  of what they win. So if you bring in somebody who gets $10 million, you walk away with a [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=113.64s)]
*  million dollars. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=120.64s)]
*  Now, you just said that you want the American people to know you can't be bought. Your decisions [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=121.64s)]
*  won't depend on how much money you could make in the future. You won't go to work for a [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=127.2s)]
*  drug company after you leave HHS, but you and I both know there's another way to make [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=131.68s)]
*  money. So, Mr. Kennedy, will you also agree that you won't take any compensation from [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=137.24s)]
*  any lawsuits against drug companies while you are secretary and for four years afterwards? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=144.8s)]
*  Well, I'll certainly commit to that while I'm secretary. I do want to clarify something, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=152.8s)]
*  because you're making me sound like a shill. I put together that case. I did the Science [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=160.72s)]
*  Day presentation of the judge on that case to get it into court. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=169.64000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kennedy, it's just a really simple question. You've taken in $2.5 million. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=174.12s)]
*  I want to know if you will commit right now that not only will you not go to work for [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=180.96s)]
*  drug companies, you won't go to work suing the drug companies and taking your rake out [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=185.04s)]
*  of that while you're secretary and for four years after. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=191.28s)]
*  I'll commit to not taking any fees from drug companies while I'm secretary. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm asking about fees from suing drug companies. Will you agree not to do that? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=201.84s)]
*  You're asking me to not sue drug companies. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  You can sue drug companies as much as you want. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  I'm not going to agree to not sue drug companies or anybody. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  Let's do a quick count here of how as secretary of HHS, if you get confirmed, you could influence [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  every one of those lawsuits. Well, let me start the list. You can publish your anti-vaccine [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=229.4s)]
*  conspiracies, but this time on U.S. Government letterheads, something a jury might be impressed [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=235.64s)]
*  by. You could appoint a key court to this CDC vaccine panel who share your anti-vax [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  views and let them do your dirty work. You could tell the CDC vaccine panel to remove [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=247.23999999999998s)]
*  a particular vaccine from the vaccine schedule. You could remove vaccines from special compensation [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=252.48s)]
*  programs which would open up manufacturers to mass torts. You could make more injuries [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=259.0s)]
*  eligible for compensation even if there is no causal evidence. You could change vaccine [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=264.64s)]
*  court processes to make it easier to bring junk lawsuits. You could turn over FDA data [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=270.44s)]
*  to your friends at the law firm and they could use it however it benefited them. You could [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=276.14s)]
*  change vaccine labeling. You could change vaccine information rules. You could change [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  which claims are compensated in the vaccine injury compensation program. There's a lot [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=286.12s)]
*  of ways that you can influence those future lawsuits and pending lawsuits while you are [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=292.88s)]
*  Secretary of HHS and I'm asking you to commit right now that you will not take a financial [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=299.44s)]
*  stake in every one of those lawsuits so that what you do as Secretary will also benefit [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=306.88s)]
*  you financially down the line. I'll comply with all the ethical guidelines. That's not [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=313.96s)]
*  the question. You and I, you have said repeatedly... [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=319.52s)]
*  You're asking me, Senator, you're asking me not to remove vaccine from other companies. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=322.0s)]
*  No, I am not. My country is stuck in a rich... [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=327.0s)]
*  Yeah, you are. That's exactly what you're doing. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=330.0s)]
*  Look, no one should be fooled here. As Secretary of HHS, Robert Kennedy will have the power [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=332.0s)]
*  to undercut vaccines and vaccine manufacturing across our country. And for all of his talk [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=340.44s)]
*  about follow the science and his promise that he won't interfere with those of us who want [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=347.48s)]
*  to vaccinate his kids, the bottom line is the same. Kennedy can kill off access to vaccines [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=352.44s)]
*  and make millions of dollars while he does it. Kids might die, but Robert Kennedy can [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=360.04s)]
*  keep cashing in. Senator, I support vaccines. I support the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=366.4s)]
*  childhood schedule. I will do that. The only thing I want is good science, and that's it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=373.4s)]
*  How about then say you won't make money off what you do as Secretary of HHS? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=380.47999999999996s)]
*  Before we go to Senator Tillis, I think it would be important for me to make it very [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=385.47999999999996s)]
*  clear that Mr. Kennedy has gone through the same Office of Government Ethics process as [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=390.76s)]
*  every single other nominee in the Finance Committee this year and in previous administrations [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=396.58s)]
*  in addition to listing his assets, including the items that you've identified. He has signed [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=403.3s)]
*  an ethics letter that has been reviewed by the Office of Government Ethics concerning [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=408.53999999999996s)]
*  any possible conflict in light of its functions and the nominee's proposed duties. And we [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=412.97999999999996s)]
*  have a letter from the Office of Government Ethics that he hasn't complied completely [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=419.38s)]
*  with all applicable laws and regulations governing conflicts of interest. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=423.9s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, point of information here. Have we had a single nominee come through who's [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=430.9s)]
*  made $2.5 million off suing one of the entities that it would be regulating and plans to keep [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=437.46s)]
*  getting a take of every lawsuit in the future? Have we had that before? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=446.9s)]
*  I haven't reviewed the past documentation of every other nominee's financial interests, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=450.65999999999997s)]
*  and so no. But I know that every single time we get a nominee, their financial interests [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=457.0s)]
*  are attacked. That's why we have the Office of Government Ethics. That's why they've [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=460.5s)]
*  reviewed everything that's in his record, and that's why he has even, I think, and I [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=465.42s)]
*  don't know that I want to ask him to get into it, but he has listed his assets and has gone [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=472.42s)]
*  through a discussion of the responsibilities under our ethics laws and has complied with [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=477.78s)]
*  all of those requirements. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUEM3b6pqik&t=483.82s)]
