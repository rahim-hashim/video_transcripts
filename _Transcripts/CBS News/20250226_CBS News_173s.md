# Musk joining Trump's first Cabinet meeting
**CBS News:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ)
*  President Trump is holding his first Cabinet meeting of his second term today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And while Elon Musk is not an official Cabinet member, the White House says he will be there. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=4.32s)]
*  The Tesla and SpaceX CEO is classified as a special government employee. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=9.36s)]
*  But to speak more about that upcoming meeting, let's bring in CBS News senior White House correspondent, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=14.48s)]
*  Weijia Zhang. As you see her there at the White House this morning. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Weijia, some of these Cabinet members told their staff not to follow Musk's email directive about what they did in the past week. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=21.04s)]
*  So how do we expect this meeting to run today? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=28.0s)]
*  Well, Errol, I think that already exposes a potential power struggle among Elon Musk and some of these Cabinet secretaries and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=32.96s)]
*  department heads who, as you mentioned, told them to basically ignore Musk's demands. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=40.72s)]
*  And so they will all be face to face together. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=46.92s)]
*  Surely this will come up. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=48.96s)]
*  Of course, the White House says that the reason why those particular agencies like Department of Homeland Security, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=50.6s)]
*  the FBI, the State Department, Defense Department told their employees not to put in writing their accomplishments. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=57.04s)]
*  They're saying it's a matter of national security and not because they're trying to go against what Musk says. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=63.92s)]
*  But it will certainly be a very interesting meeting because Musk is actually not even part of the Cabinet, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=70.48s)]
*  but it just shows you how the president views him and how much, you know, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=76.72s)]
*  authority that he wants to hand over to Musk to be in the room with everybody else. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=81.32s)]
*  Another big headline we've been reporting is on this framework that the U.S. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=87.63999999999999s)]
*  and Ukraine have reached as far as accessing Ukraine's rare minerals. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  What what's in this framework and what would it guarantee? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=96.63999999999999s)]
*  So we don't yet know the details of how much, for example, critical minerals, oil and gas, Ukraine would be willing to give to the U.S. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=100.52s)]
*  But we do know that President Trump has been pushing for this hard, really for several weeks now. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=111.16s)]
*  And initially, he said that it was because he wanted Ukraine to pay back the billions of dollars [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  that the U.S. has already supplied them in order to fight this ongoing war with Russia. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  So the president was asked, what does Ukraine get out of this deal? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=128.88s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=132.92s)]
*  Three hundred and fifty billion dollars and lots of equipment and military equipment and the right to fight on. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=134.51999999999998s)]
*  And originally the right to fight. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=140.44s)]
*  Look, Ukraine, I will say they're very brave and they're good soldiers. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=143.72s)]
*  But without the United States and its money and its military equipment, this war would have been over in a very short period of time. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=148.24s)]
*  President Trump said in the Oval Office yesterday, Erroll, that he thinks that President Zelensky is coming here for a meeting on Friday. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=156.92s)]
*  And he touted the agreement as a very big deal. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=164.64s)]
*  All right, we'll continue to watch that closely. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=169.76s)]
*  Weijia, thanks so much. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdiFy3iTUQ&t=171.28s)]
