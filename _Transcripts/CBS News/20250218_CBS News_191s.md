# Reaction to U.S.-Russia talks about Ukraine war
**CBS News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g)
*  We turn our attention back now to Saudi Arabia, where talks between top U.S. and Russian officials [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=0.0s)]
*  on the war in Ukraine have now ended. Among the officials at the meeting were Secretary of State [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=5.28s)]
*  Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Notably missing from all of this was [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=10.56s)]
*  Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. In fact, no Ukrainian official were present for these talks [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=16.64s)]
*  at all. For more on this, I'm joined by CBS News Senior Foreign Correspondent Holly Williams joining [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=21.6s)]
*  us from our London bureau. Holly, what reaction are you hearing to these talks? Any hint yet? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=25.92s)]
*  I know it's early that some substantive progress was made. Good morning, Errol. Well, Vladimir [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=31.6s)]
*  Putin's foreign policy adviser, who was at those talks along with the Russian foreign minister [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=37.44s)]
*  representing Russia, reportedly says that the talks were a success, but we don't have any [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  details beyond that. You'll remember that during the presidential campaign, President Trump claimed [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=47.36s)]
*  that he could end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours. Obviously, that hasn't happened so far. But what [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=52.24s)]
*  we are seeing is a kind of high-speed diplomacy. We had that telephone call last week between [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=57.92s)]
*  President Trump and Vladimir Putin that apparently lasted nearly 90 minutes. Today, this meeting and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=62.96s)]
*  expectations of a summit between Trump and Putin soon, perhaps also in Saudi Arabia. But many [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=67.92s)]
*  Ukrainians feel betrayed because they're not involved. And their president, Vladimir Zelensky, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=73.76s)]
*  said yesterday that his government, quote, will not recognize any agreement about us made without [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=79.04s)]
*  us. That seems to call into question the legitimacy of these negotiations, Errol. And just to underscore [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=85.92s)]
*  how really remarkable the meeting is, Sergey Lavrov is still sanctioned by the US and the Treasury [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=92.48s)]
*  Department because of what the US said was his direct involvement in the invasion into Ukraine. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=98.16000000000001s)]
*  And considering Zelensky's reservations about the US and Russia meeting, what really can be achieved? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=105.83999999999999s)]
*  It is significant that Russia and the US are talking directly, but what can really come of this? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=111.6s)]
*  That's a really interesting point. Look, for nearly three years, Russia has been isolated from the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  West by sanctions and condemnation because Vladimir Putin started this war with his invasion of Ukraine. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=121.52s)]
*  Now, we've had that phone call between Trump and Putin. We're having today's meeting and some would [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  say that's a kind of victory already for Vladimir Putin. Many people here in Europe fear that Putin [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=132.16s)]
*  will succeed in doing a deal with President Trump that effectively rewards Russia with Ukrainian [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=138.32s)]
*  territory and then doesn't give Ukraine the security guarantees that it wants to protect [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  itself, which could allow Putin to reinvade Ukraine in the future. On top of that, last week, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=149.84s)]
*  the Secretary of Defense, Pete Haggis, met with his counterparts in Europe and kind of laid out [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=154.96s)]
*  the limits of US support for Ukraine, saying the US does not support NATO membership for Ukraine, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=159.76s)]
*  saying the US will not contribute any troops to a peacekeeping force in Ukraine, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=165.12s)]
*  and believes that returning Ukraine to its pre-2014 borders, that is its borders before the first time [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=169.2s)]
*  that Vladimir Putin invaded, was unrealistic. Now, that has also been widely criticised as kind of [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=175.12s)]
*  giving away US leverage to Russia before the negotiations even began. Errol? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=180.88s)]
*  All right, Holly Williams, great to get your reporting on this. Thank you very much. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBC_FlTK-g&t=187.04s)]
