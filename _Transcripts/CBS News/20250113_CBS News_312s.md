# Wind speeds are picking up in Los Angeles area as fires rage
**CBS News:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k)
*  Officials in Los Angeles are investigating what caused evacuation alerts to be sent [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=0.0s)]
*  to the cell phones of people in wrong locations. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=4.26s)]
*  Those people later received a follow-up message saying, disregard. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=7.74s)]
*  The company behind the technology tells CBS News it's working with the county to figure [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=11.74s)]
*  out why alerts were sent to a larger area than intended. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=15.48s)]
*  CBS News' national environmental correspondent David Schechter explains. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=19.48s)]
*  If you receive an evacuation order, please leave immediately. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Have you received a warning? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=27.68s)]
*  Get ready. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=29.4s)]
*  When wildfires ignite, it's local emergency managers and law enforcement who send evacuation [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=30.4s)]
*  alerts to a community. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=35.96s)]
*  New technology in LA County draws these alert polygons that determine who gets the message. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=37.68s)]
*  If you're in the polygon, you're going to get an alert. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=43.96s)]
*  Lisa Bernard is with Genesis, makers of the alert system used by LA County. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=46.08s)]
*  Its computer algorithm had already defined these zones. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=50.46s)]
*  It considers things like population density, hazard areas, and how people can get out. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=53.78s)]
*  Having those predefined areas really speeds up that process of defining the area that's [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=59.7s)]
*  being evacuated and then communicating that out to the public. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=65.5s)]
*  For example, on Wednesday morning, as the Eaton fire approached, people living in this [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=69.66s)]
*  polygon in the Pasadena area got a message to evacuate. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=73.82s)]
*  But we wondered why the boundary line goes right down the middle of the road. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=78.14s)]
*  Sometimes a street you'd have one side is alerted and the other side is not alerted. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=82.1s)]
*  Some of these things make natural fire breaks. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=86.38s)]
*  Some of the footage that we've seen really, really illustrates that well, where you have [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  one side of the street that's backed up to a tree covered hillside that's very flammable. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=93.02s)]
*  And the other side of the street is concrete parking lots. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=97.86s)]
*  In some previous wildfires, there was hesitation sending widespread alerts. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=101.16s)]
*  Craig Fugate is a former FEMA administrator and Genesis board member. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=105.94s)]
*  When you're sitting there as an Inuit commander and I'm like looking at a fire, I'm looking [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=109.66s)]
*  at my maps and I'm trying to figure out where I need to evacuate. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=112.53999999999999s)]
*  I'm like, well, how far do I go? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  Which direction I go? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=117.14s)]
*  He believes this new technology helps alleviate that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=118.3s)]
*  Do you think ultimately that saves lives? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=121.74s)]
*  Well, that's our hope. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=124.46s)]
*  And I think it lowers the barrier that we saw for some emergency managers who are always [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=126.0s)]
*  concerned about overwarning and creating more problems with too many people hearing the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=130.85999999999999s)]
*  evacuation that aren't at risk jamming up the roads where people couldn't get out. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=135.7s)]
*  A next step will be assessing whether alerts in L.A. gave people enough time and information [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=140.45999999999998s)]
*  to protect themselves. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=145.89999999999998s)]
*  David Schechter, CBS News, Dallas. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=147.14s)]
*  If you are looking for a way to help the survivors of these wildfires, you can go to redcross.org [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=149.73999999999998s)]
*  slash CBS. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=154.26s)]
*  Firefighters from California and eight other states, plus Canada and Mexico, are battling [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=157.5s)]
*  the flames. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=161.45999999999998s)]
*  CBS News senior weather correspondent Rob Marciano reports from Pasadena on some of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=162.70000000000002s)]
*  the other resources involved in fighting these fires. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=166.26000000000002s)]
*  Winds are calm here to start the day at the command post of the Eaton Fire, which is actually [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=169.86s)]
*  the parking lot of the Rose Bowl. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=173.82s)]
*  The stadium is about 300 yards that way, but you obviously see a lot of activity here with [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=176.54000000000002s)]
*  fire trucks. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=181.42000000000002s)]
*  About 300, over 300 engines here and over 3000 personnel, federal, county and local [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=182.42000000000002s)]
*  firemen trying to get after this fire. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=188.32s)]
*  The federal guys are actually sleeping on the ground here in tents for as much sleep [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=191.06s)]
*  as they can get in an eight hour period because they work 16 hour shifts. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=195.62s)]
*  So they're getting back on the fire lines right now in anticipation of making more progress today. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=199.18s)]
*  Rob, thank you. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=206.1s)]
*  As the wildfires continue to burn, forecasters continue to track those winds, which appear [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=207.1s)]
*  to be ready to increase again. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=211.22s)]
*  CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Grant Gilmore is tracking this for us. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=213.7s)]
*  Hey, Grant. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=217.1s)]
*  So really keeping a close eye on those conditions across Southern California as those Santa [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=218.22s)]
*  Ana winds increase again throughout the day today. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=222.98s)]
*  Not just a critical, but an extreme fire concern today over portions of Los Angeles and Ventura [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=226.82s)]
*  County. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=235.22s)]
*  Wind gusts have already been up around 70 miles per hour today and we expect that to [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=236.22s)]
*  continue as we head through tonight into the day tomorrow. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=239.22s)]
*  So you've got really dry air. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=243.34s)]
*  You've got dry conditions on the ground combined with those gusty winds and fires are not only [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=244.98s)]
*  going to be able to start easily, but they'll be able to spread very quickly because of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=249.29999999999998s)]
*  those expected gusty winds, especially in that extreme fire danger area there. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=254.26s)]
*  Santa Clarita just north of Los Angeles there in Los Angeles County up towards Fillmore. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  It's going to be a dangerous couple of days here with these gusty conditions. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=264.42s)]
*  Red flag warnings in effect through the entire area. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=268.58s)]
*  In fact, a particularly dangerous situation unfolding here. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=270.58s)]
*  A lot of high wind watch and high wind warnings all going to be in effect as we make our way [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=274.82s)]
*  through the next couple of days over Southern California. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=278.42s)]
*  Meanwhile, we're tracking a system that's moving across the Gulf states that will bring [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=281.78s)]
*  rain to the Florida Panhandle to the southeast today. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=285.7s)]
*  A clipper system moving across the Great Lakes that brings some snow opens up more Arctic [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=288.62s)]
*  air to plummet in from the north as we head through the middle of the week. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=293.58s)]
*  So that means below normal temperatures for much of the eastern half of the United States, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=297.34s)]
*  10 to 20 degrees below normal as we go through the middle of the week with then some more [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=301.62s)]
*  moderating air as we make our way through the second half of the week toward the weekend. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=305.7s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=310.18s)]
*  Okay, Grant, thank you. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtm10XLBN2k&t=310.82s)]
