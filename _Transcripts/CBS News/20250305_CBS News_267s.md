# China threatens war on tariffs as Trump administration weighs adjustments
**CBS News:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo)
*  It's been a dismal couple of days on Wall Street as markets react in real time to President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's tough talk on tariffs. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=4.92s)]
*  So will the president blink while playing the tariff cards with Canada and Mexico and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=7.22s)]
*  then maybe ease those tariffs? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=11.86s)]
*  So as we watch Wall Street right now, here is what we know. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=13.42s)]
*  Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick says there could be a compromise as soon as today. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=17.1s)]
*  Trump's new tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico prompted a huge sell off. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=22.3s)]
*  The Dow losing more than 1300 points in two days. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=26.14s)]
*  So what we're seeing today is a little bit better. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=29.64s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News Money Watch correspondent Kelly O'Grady. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=33.0s)]
*  Kelly, we're watching those markets. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=35.44s)]
*  They really are hinging on hopes for a compromise here. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=36.8s)]
*  We also know President Donald Trump meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=40.28s)]
*  relative to those tariffs. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=43.96s)]
*  What are you looking for today? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=45.64s)]
*  Yeah, definitely when Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that last night that there could [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=47.64s)]
*  be a compromise. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=55.06s)]
*  The market wasn't trading, but you always look at futures and all of a sudden it spiked [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  up a couple hundred points. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=60.2s)]
*  It came back today and now we're back up again. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=61.64s)]
*  So really there's a lot of volatility as investors are waiting for some kind of answer. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=64.52000000000001s)]
*  Now what we do know is that the meeting in the middle, it does sound like there are tariffs [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=68.8s)]
*  that will remain, but there might be certain sectors that would be exempt. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=74.08s)]
*  The auto industry has been particularly called out as one of those that might be exempt from [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=78.4s)]
*  those tariffs. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=83.28s)]
*  We have a very interconnected supply chain when it comes to Canada, Mexico and the US. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=84.28s)]
*  For many of the major automakers and of course the Ford CEO just a month ago warned how [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=90.3s)]
*  these tariffs could really decimate the US auto industry. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=95.22s)]
*  So that will be one to watch. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=98.46000000000001s)]
*  The other two areas that I'm particularly looking at is if there's any movement on the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=99.78s)]
*  Canadian or tariff on Canadian energy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=104.26s)]
*  Remember there's a 10% tariff on oil and gas and energy coming from Canada. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=106.94s)]
*  We get a lot of our energy from Canada so that is one to watch. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=111.16s)]
*  And then also lumber, aluminum and steel. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=114.96s)]
*  Really three key inputs for home building. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=117.82s)]
*  I doubt we're going to see any movement on the aluminum and steel tariffs as the president [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  did mention that in his speech last night. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=125.96s)]
*  But potentially lumber we could see some movement. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=129.06s)]
*  So those are kind of the areas that I'm looking for and of course we'll see the markets react [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=131.2s)]
*  accordingly if we do get that message today. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=134.84s)]
*  Alright Kelly so let's move on to the other C nation as it is China. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  They are really firing back at Donald Trump's move to double down on those Chinese goods. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=142.6s)]
*  The Chinese embassy, look at this, in the United States posted to social media saying [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=148.6s)]
*  in part quote, if war is what the US wants, be it a tariff war, trade war or any other [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=152.24s)]
*  type of war, we are ready to fight until the end. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  And just we should remember we don't just rely on China for exports. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=161.12s)]
*  Trade wars and companies also do business in China so what is at stake right now when [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=166.4s)]
*  we hear that tough talk from China? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=169.6s)]
*  Yeah I didn't love that last phrase, any kind of war. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=172.0s)]
*  That always sort of sends shivers up your spine, not just a trade war, but specifically [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  talking about our economic ties. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=180.98000000000002s)]
*  You're right, we rely on China, China relies on us. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=182.56s)]
*  We import a lot of goods into this country and export a lot. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=185.58s)]
*  The two areas that I think could be really problematic for us if we got into a trade [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=188.44s)]
*  war would be industries that might be decimated. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=194.08s)]
*  I'm thinking particularly of farming. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=196.44s)]
*  China has already slapped back with retaliatory tariffs on areas like soybean and corn which [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  were decimated under the first Trump administration when those tariffs were in place. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=204.72s)]
*  Another thing would be, as you say, companies that do a lot of business in China. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  So think Apple, Nike, Starbucks, those are companies that have a very, very vested interest [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=214.24s)]
*  in being able to sell to the Chinese market, Tesla as well. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=221.24s)]
*  So there could really be a lot of back and forth here. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=224.8s)]
*  The context that I will give is yes, there does seem to be a lot of bark in that language. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=227.32000000000002s)]
*  I'm not sure how much bite there will be because the Chinese response has been measured thus [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=232.56s)]
*  far to the tariffs that we have slapped on them and their goods that we import into this [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=238.56s)]
*  country versus what we saw under the first Trump administration. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=243.4s)]
*  We do know they're meeting right now for their economic congress and they are struggling [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=247.28s)]
*  a bit economically. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=252.82s)]
*  So I will be curious to see if it's bark or bite when it comes to that language that we [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=254.04s)]
*  saw in that message that you shared. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=259.92s)]
*  Bark, bite, or bargaining, we know you've got them all covered. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=262.32s)]
*  Kelly O'Grady, always great to talk to you, my friend. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIaj62J4qo&t=265.36s)]
