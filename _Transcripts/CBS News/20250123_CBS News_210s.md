# Trump sending 1,500 additional troops to southern border
**CBS News:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI)
*  CBS News has exclusively learned that U.S. border agents have been told to deport migrants [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=0.0s)]
*  without granting asylum hearings or allowing them to request legal protection. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=5.84s)]
*  This comes as the administration says it plans to send 1,500 additional troops to the U.S.-Mexico [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  border. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=16.48s)]
*  In his first TV interview since becoming president, Trump discussed his immigration policies and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=17.52s)]
*  was asked about his approach to sanctuary cities. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=22.28s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=25.28s)]
*  We're trying to get rid of them, we're trying to end them, and a lot of the people in those [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=26.720000000000002s)]
*  communities don't want them. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=29.6s)]
*  You know, California is a big example. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=31.12s)]
*  Would you cut off their money? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  I might have to do that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=34.0s)]
*  Sometimes that's the only thing you can do. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=35.64s)]
*  Trump's immigration policies are already being challenged meantime. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=38.32s)]
*  In just a few hours, a federal judge in Seattle is set to hold a hearing on the lawsuit filed [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=41.96s)]
*  by multiple states you see on your screen challenging his executive order which aims [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  to revoke birthright citizenship. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  And later today, in a separate headline for you, Trump is set to virtually address leaders [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=55.04s)]
*  at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=59.44s)]
*  That annual gathering brings global leaders together with some of the wealthiest people [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=62.68s)]
*  in the world. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=67.18s)]
*  For more on all of this, let's bring in CBS News political reporter Aaron Navarro joining [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=68.18s)]
*  us from our D.C. bureau this morning. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=72.48s)]
*  Aaron, let's get back to Trump and his immigration and border policies. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=74.76s)]
*  Which agencies will now be heading to the southern border and where is that drawing [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=78.92s)]
*  resources from? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=84.14s)]
*  Good morning, Errol. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=86.02s)]
*  Drawing resources at the request of the Department of Defense. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=87.25999999999999s)]
*  Fifteen hundred troops by an executive order Trump signed earlier this week will be heading [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=90.74s)]
*  to the border. A thousand from the army in addition to five hundred Marines that will [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=95.25999999999999s)]
*  be going to El Paso and San Diego. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=99.89999999999999s)]
*  That's in addition to twenty five hundred military troops that were already along the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=101.89999999999999s)]
*  southern border. And these troops will not be acting necessarily as law enforcement, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=106.06s)]
*  but will be assisting border patrol when it comes to detaining migrants as well as a [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=110.5s)]
*  request to build barriers along the southern border. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=115.33999999999999s)]
*  And the Trump administration has requested potentially up to ten thousand military troops [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=118.94s)]
*  to be sent to the border. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=124.22s)]
*  They put in a request to the Pentagon for a quote unrestricted resources and personnel, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=125.3s)]
*  according to an internal CBP memo. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=132.29999999999998s)]
*  And what did Trump have to say yesterday in this interview with Fox about his pardoning [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=135.06s)]
*  of January 6th defendants, which some Republicans don't seem to agree with? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=139.73999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Republicans seem to not agree with the pardoning, especially of those who were [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=144.66s)]
*  violent towards Capitol Police officers on that day. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=149.5s)]
*  Trump was asked about that and he repeated a similar line, you know, decrying the prison [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=152.17999999999998s)]
*  conditions that some of these were some of these people were held in, even though a lot [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=158.29999999999998s)]
*  of them had still been in pretrial, had not even seen sentencing. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=163.38s)]
*  But he also alluded to the reason why the rioters and protesters were at the Capitol [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=166.86s)]
*  that day following his, you know, quote, big lie about the 2020 election being stolen. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=172.06s)]
*  Take a listen to the clip. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=177.78s)]
*  They were protesting the vote because they knew the election was rigged and they were [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=179.74s)]
*  protesting the vote. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=183.9s)]
*  And that should be allowed to protest the vote. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=185.82s)]
*  Trump added that those who breached the Capitol, quote, should not have happened, but later [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=190.34s)]
*  said among the overall group of people who were there that day that they were, quote, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=195.18s)]
*  they showed a lot of patriotism. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=200.02s)]
*  And it's important for folks to understand there was no evidence of widespread voter [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=202.58s)]
*  fraud. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=206.42000000000002s)]
*  Aaron Navarro, we appreciate the update. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=207.42000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWBuVXb-WI&t=208.86s)]
