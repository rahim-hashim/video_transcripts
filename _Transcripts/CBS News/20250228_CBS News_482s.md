# Shocked Ukrainians react to bombastic Trump-Zelenskyy meeting
**CBS News:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY)
*  But for now, I want to bring in CBS News foreign correspondent M.T.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=0.0s)]
*  Tayyab. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=3.96s)]
*  He is following the latest on this story from Kyiv this hour. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=4.96s)]
*  M.T.S., I know you've been getting some reaction online, folks there, many of them obviously [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=7.8s)]
*  still sleeping this morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=12.08s)]
*  But what are you seeing in terms of reaction this hour? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=13.64s)]
*  SHANEL, it's around 9 p.m. here in Kyiv. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  You can imagine most people aren't really watching TV, but news is starting to trickle [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=23.14s)]
*  in. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=28.44s)]
*  We spoke with a well-known Ukrainian journalist earlier, and we caught her at the grocery [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=29.44s)]
*  store and she said, you have to excuse me, I'm crying. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=34.32s)]
*  And that, I think, really just sums up the mood here in Ukraine, which is a mixture of [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=37.7s)]
*  shock, disbelief and dread as to what may come next. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=42.56s)]
*  Many people woke up this morning with a little bit of hope. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=48.2s)]
*  They heard from President Trump where he was kind of walking back his false allegation [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=50.56s)]
*  that Vladimir Zelensky was, in his words, a dictator. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=54.88s)]
*  Again, a false allegation. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=58.12s)]
*  He is a democratically elected leader here in Ukraine. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=59.72s)]
*  He has pretty good approval ratings in this country. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  And here we are, this extraordinary scene again on a day when many Ukrainians had thought [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=67.16s)]
*  Mr. Zelensky was going to go there, sign a deal with President Trump and potentially [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=71.42s)]
*  turn a page, start a new relationship with this new president that will hopefully, in [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=76.28s)]
*  their view, also end this war, but not on Vladimir Putin's terms. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=81.6s)]
*  And now that is something that many people here, I would imagine, are not believing is [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  going to happen. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  And we have to consider this, Chanel. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=91.54s)]
*  This is a country for the last three years has suffered so brutally. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=93.7s)]
*  We have to consider tens of thousands of people have been killed. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=98.48s)]
*  Six million people are abroad living as refugees. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=102.0s)]
*  Millions are internal refugees. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  And there are many more people who have suffered wounds that have changed their lives. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=106.72s)]
*  And there are many more who suffer internal wounds and indeed have lost their homes. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  Russia occupies 20 percent of this country. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=114.32s)]
*  This is a country which has suffered so much pain, so much agony. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=117.1s)]
*  They want the war to end. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=121.48s)]
*  But again, not on Vladimir Putin's terms. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=123.2s)]
*  And many fear that's exactly what's unfolding this evening. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=125.88s)]
*  And, MTS, based on your reporting there in Ukraine, can you speak about how Vladimir [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=128.88s)]
*  Putin may have watched this moment and interpreted that exchange between the president here in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=133.92s)]
*  the U.S., President Trump and Zelensky? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=138.72s)]
*  It's a really important question, Chanel. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=143.72s)]
*  And the short answer is that Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin are no doubt reacting with [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=146.48s)]
*  glee at, frankly, that spectacle that we saw at the White House. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=152.04s)]
*  Again, we've been using the word unprecedented to see a president and a vice president with [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=156.52s)]
*  a world leader in the Oval Office with a huge crowd of journalists around them and the kind [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=161.4s)]
*  of exchange that we saw. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=167.36s)]
*  And of course, we now know Mr. Zelensky has left. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=169.16s)]
*  That deal was not signed. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=172.0s)]
*  And it really just underscores, I think, from the point of view of Vladimir Putin and indeed [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=174.72s)]
*  the Kremlin, that this is exactly what they want. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  They want to see Vladimir Zelensky isolated. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=183.8s)]
*  They don't want to be isolated. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=187.58s)]
*  They want to come out into the world. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=188.84s)]
*  They want to be welcomed back to the fold in a way that it seems like President Trump [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=190.56s)]
*  is. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=194.52s)]
*  Remember, not that long ago, there were face-to-face talks in Saudi Arabia between U.S. officials [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=195.52s)]
*  and Russian officials. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=200.84s)]
*  Not there was Ukraine. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  Not there were Ukraine, sorry, European partners. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=204.4s)]
*  And it really just feels like this momentum is building in the direction of Vladimir Putin, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=207.56s)]
*  who it must be clear started this war. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  Not just three years ago, but back in 2014 when he annexed Crimea, occupied large sections [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=216.08s)]
*  of the Donbass and then restarted the war three years ago and the devastation that we've [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=221.68s)]
*  seen ever since. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=226.32000000000002s)]
*  As you rightly point out, I've been reporting on this war almost nonstop for that three [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=227.32s)]
*  years and the devastation we've seen is unspeakable. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=231.48s)]
*  But very quickly, Chanel, what I do want to say, there is something that really struck [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=234.88s)]
*  me in that exchange, which was Vladimir Zelensky was accused of not being grateful. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=239.04s)]
*  I've been covering Ukraine for a long time and since this invasion that was led by Vladimir [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=244.56s)]
*  Putin. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=250.32s)]
*  I have never met a group of people, our country, our nation more grateful for U.S. support [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=251.32s)]
*  than Ukrainians. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=256.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean it, more grateful than Ukrainians. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=257.88s)]
*  And for them to be in this moment where this country, which they have become to rely on [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=261.52000000000004s)]
*  so much, the United States of America, to suddenly take this turn, I think for many [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=268.12s)]
*  Ukrainians tonight, it is not only a sense of dread and confusion, but also deep, deep [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=272.94s)]
*  sadness. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=278.44s)]
*  Chanel. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=279.44s)]
*  I'm glad you picked up on that point, M.T.S., because there was a lot of talk during that [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=280.44s)]
*  conversation about the amount and type of U.S. support for Ukraine in the last couple [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=283.84s)]
*  of years. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=288.96s)]
*  Because you have boots on the ground there, I wonder if you can speak to what all that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=290.28s)]
*  support looks like on the ground in Ukraine and whether there are now any concerns that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=293.23999999999995s)]
*  that could be threatened. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=299.08s)]
*  Yeah, that is the ultimate concern here, Chanel, is that all of this support that has been [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  received not just from the U.S. and it has to be clear. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=307.47999999999996s)]
*  President Trump has very greatly exaggerated. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=310.59999999999997s)]
*  The dollar figure, for lack of a better phrase, of what the U.S. has provided Ukraine. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=313.6s)]
*  Still, it's in the many, many, many billions of dollars. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=318.16s)]
*  It's not nothing. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=320.88000000000005s)]
*  But when you consider the fact that the U.S. has provided Ukraine with things like long-range [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=322.0s)]
*  missiles, aircraft, anti-aircraft devices as well, which has really helped Ukraine to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=326.64000000000004s)]
*  repel Russia's drone strikes. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=332.70000000000005s)]
*  In fact, from Saturday of last week up until the day before yesterday, Russia launched [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=334.68s)]
*  some of the largest drone and missile strikes across Ukraine that we've seen since the start [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=340.96s)]
*  of this war. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  This is a very active conflict. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=346.03999999999996s)]
*  And the support from the U.S., the military support from the U.S., and the diplomatic [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=348.11999999999995s)]
*  support from the U.S. has allowed this, frankly, David and Goliath battle, David, of course, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=351.71999999999997s)]
*  being Ukraine, to stand up to the might and the power of Russia in the way that they have [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=357.52s)]
*  could not have been done without the support of the U.S., could not have been done without [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=362.02s)]
*  the support of Europe. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=366.03999999999996s)]
*  And so the fact that there's a possibility that the kind of support we've been seeing [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=368.56s)]
*  from the U.S. may vanish very quickly, that spreads a lot of doom and dread here in Ukraine [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=373.44s)]
*  for people who are at this moment on the front line fighting against Russia. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=380.88s)]
*  And MTS, there was another really heated moment where Zelensky was trying to tell President [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=385.52s)]
*  Donald Trump that if Ukraine fell, it would have a global impact. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=390.64s)]
*  Talk about what would happen if the U.S. were to pull support for Ukraine here. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=396.1s)]
*  What kind of impact we could see, especially immediately in Europe? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=400.58s)]
*  Look, the fear is, is that Vladimir Putin will take over all of Ukraine. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=404.94s)]
*  He's made it very clear he sees Ukraine as part of Russia. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=411.74s)]
*  He had this big manifesto at the start of the war where he reasoned as to why he thought [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=415.52s)]
*  Ukraine was part of Russia and he was well within his right to take over this country. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=420.62s)]
*  But it's bigger than that because there are other former Soviet countries that Vladimir [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=426.82s)]
*  Putin may potentially see as rightfully part of Russia. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=431.66s)]
*  And what if he attacks them? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=435.7s)]
*  And more importantly, what if Vladimir Putin attacks a NATO country? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=437.5s)]
*  NATO, of course, is that transatlantic alliance that the U.S. is part of, that Europe is part [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=441.34000000000003s)]
*  And they have a rule, which is an attack on one country that belongs to NATO is an attack [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=446.26s)]
*  on all of NATO. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=451.73999999999995s)]
*  And so does that mean that the nightmare scenario which so many people have been trying to prevent, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=453.5s)]
*  which is all of Europe at war with Russia, is that more likely now than it was just a [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=459.38s)]
*  few hours ago? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=466.26s)]
*  We don't know the answer to that question, but that is the fear and the repercussions [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnodmN0MAfY&t=467.41999999999996s)]
