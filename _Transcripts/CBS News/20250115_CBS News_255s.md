# Pam Bondi on Trump's apparent "enemy list," Jan. 6 pardons
**CBS News:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE)
*  Six of President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet nominees are on Capitol Hill today for their [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=0.0s)]
*  Senate confirmation hearings. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=4.72s)]
*  One of the most highly anticipated hearings of the day was for Attorney General nominee [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=6.8s)]
*  Pam Bundy. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=11.44s)]
*  Now, she served as the attorney general of the state of Florida and has openly denied [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=12.44s)]
*  the results of the 2020 presidential election. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=17.28s)]
*  President-elect has previously mentioned retaliating against those who he thinks have wronged him [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=20.96s)]
*  leading many Democrats to express their concern about what Bundy may do as the head of the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=26.94s)]
*  Justice Department. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=31.66s)]
*  Now, when asked about this, she refused to say Trump lost in 2020. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=32.660000000000004s)]
*  Are you prepared to say today under oath without reservation that Donald Trump lost the presidential [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=38.5s)]
*  contest to Joe Biden in 2020? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=43.46s)]
*  Ranking member Durbin, President Biden is the president of the United States. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=47.86s)]
*  He was duly sworn in and he is the president of the United States. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=52.88s)]
*  There was a peaceful transition of power. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  President Trump left office and was overwhelmingly elected in 2024. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=59.84s)]
*  CBS News political reporter Torian Small joins us now from Capitol Hill. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=67.08s)]
*  Torian, Pam Bundy also says she wants to end the weaponization of the DOJ. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=72.08s)]
*  Let's quickly play a clip of that and get your reaction on the back end. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=77.08s)]
*  If confirmed, I will fight every day to restore confidence and integrity to the Department [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=82.88s)]
*  of Justice and each of its components. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  The partisanship, the weaponization will be gone. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=97.56s)]
*  America will have one tear of justice for all. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=102.24s)]
*  So help us understand that all. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=108.16s)]
*  She would not acknowledge that Trump lost in 2020 and she is saying she won't weaponize [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=109.8s)]
*  the DOJ, but Trump has said the opposite. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  What should we make of this testimony? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=117.56s)]
*  Yeah, Errol, this is really a case of Bundy trying to prove her independence from Trump. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=119.12s)]
*  During this hearing, actually, Senator Whitehouse questioned her on this supposed enemy list [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=125.12s)]
*  that Donald Trump has created in an attempt to get back at some of his political rivals. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=130.56s)]
*  She was asked about that point blank and she said she knew nothing of this enemy list. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=135.5s)]
*  That that would not exist under a Department of Justice run by her. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=139.76s)]
*  She was also asked about whether or not some controversial picks to be a part of that department [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  like FBI designee Cash Patel, what he said about Democrats and other political rivals, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=151.44s)]
*  whether or not that could affect her or impact her doing the job. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=158.32s)]
*  She dismissed any concerns about that, saying once again that her goal is to make sure that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=161.72s)]
*  the public is at large more confident in the Department of Justice than when she will [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=167.24s)]
*  take it up, presumably if she is confirmed. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=173.56s)]
*  What about pardoning of January 6th defendants, those involved in the insurrection? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=178.76000000000002s)]
*  What did Miss Bundy have to say on that topic? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=184.52s)]
*  Well, she said that pardoning, as we both know, is something that happens because of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=188.28s)]
*  a president, not necessarily because of an attorney general, but she was pressed on whether [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=193.88s)]
*  or not she would agree with that decision. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=198.04s)]
*  She said, look, if she has to review the cases of these individuals, specifically nonviolent [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  individuals, she would gladly take that on, but she did not necessarily say whether or [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=206.44s)]
*  not the incoming president will be justified in pardoning of anyone who committed any crimes [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=211.32s)]
*  on January 6th. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=219.0s)]
*  This was something that was a campaign promise for Donald Trump. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=220.0s)]
*  He made this a part of his platform, really, saying that January 6th is not what Democrats [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=223.84s)]
*  have painted out to, really envisioning it as a largely peaceful protest that also happened [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=230.4s)]
*  to include violence. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=237.24s)]
*  As we know, though, that not only was there violence involved, but this was an attempt [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=238.36s)]
*  to stop the certification of the electoral results that many Republicans, like you also [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=241.96s)]
*  said, including Pam Bondi, disagreed with the results of the 2020 election. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=246.88s)]
*  All right, Torian Small, getting us the latest from Capitol Hill. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=251.2s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-FcTOf4VRE&t=254.4s)]
