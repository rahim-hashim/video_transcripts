# Top moments from Pete Hegseth's Senate confirmation hearing
**CBS News:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM)
*  And to all the troops and veterans watching and here in the room, Navy SEALs, Green Berets, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=0.0s)]
*  Soldiers, Pilots, Sailors, Marines, Gold Stars and more, too many friends to name. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5.54s)]
*  Officers, enlisted, Black and White, young and old, men and women, all Americans, all [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=10.84s)]
*  warriors, this hearing is for you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=16.28s)]
*  Thank you for figuratively and literally having my back. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=20.92s)]
*  I want to thank the authorities for their swift reaction to that outburst and state [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=24.92s)]
*  that similar interruptions will be treated in like manner. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=49.88s)]
*  Mr. Hegseth, you may continue. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=56.080000000000005s)]
*  As I'll say again, thank you for figuratively and literally having my back. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=58.6s)]
*  I pledge to do the same for all of you. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=66.04s)]
*  It's an honor to come before this committee today as President Donald Trump's nominee [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=68.88s)]
*  for the Office of Secretary of Defense. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=72.0s)]
*  Two months ago, 77 million Americans gave President Trump a powerful mandate for change [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=75.16s)]
*  to put America first at home and abroad. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=80.96s)]
*  I want to thank President Trump for his faith in me and his selfless leadership for our [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=85.56s)]
*  republic. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=90.36s)]
*  The troops have no better commander in chief than Donald Trump. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=91.72s)]
*  As I've said to many of you in private meetings, when President Trump chose me for this position, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  the primary charge he gave me was to bring the warrior culture back to the Department [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=101.68s)]
*  of Defense. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=107.28s)]
*  He, like me, once a Pentagon, laser focused on lethality, meritocracy, war fighting, accountability, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=108.28s)]
*  and readiness. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=118.12s)]
*  You may continue, sir. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=119.12s)]
*  Returning the Pentagon back to war fighting? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  That's it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=145.72s)]
*  That's my job. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=147.0s)]
*  Mr. Hegs, I suspend your remarks. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=148.88s)]
*  Let me just say this. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=152.36s)]
*  The Capitol Police are going to remove immediately individuals that are disrupting the hearing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=155.12s)]
*  I see a pattern attempted to be inflicted on the committee, and we're simply not going [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=161.24s)]
*  to tolerate that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=170.9s)]
*  You may proceed. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=174.84s)]
*  To bring back war fighting, if confirmed, I'm going to work with President Trump and this [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=178.27999999999997s)]
*  committee to, one, restore the warrior ethos to the Pentagon and throughout our fighting [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=182.6s)]
*  force. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=188.83999999999997s)]
*  In doing so, we will reestablish trust in our military, addressing the recruiting crisis, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=189.83999999999997s)]
*  the retention crisis, and readiness crisis in our ranks. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=195.11999999999998s)]
*  Members of the Security Force will remove members. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=203.76s)]
*  Mr. Hegs, you and your family have endured criticism of your nomination since it was [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  announced in November. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  Let's get into this allegation about sexual assault, inappropriate workplace behavior, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=224.83999999999997s)]
*  and alcohol abuse and financial mismanagement during your time as a nonprofit executive. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=231.8s)]
*  I should note that the majority of these have come from anonymous sources in liberal media [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=236.6s)]
*  publications, but I want to give you an opportunity to respond to these allegations, sir. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=244.4s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, thank you for that opportunity. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  You are correct. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=256.2s)]
*  We undertook this responsibility with an obligation to the troops, to do right by them for our [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=257.8s)]
*  war fighters. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=263.44s)]
*  And what became very evident to us from the beginning, there was a coordinated smear campaign [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=264.8s)]
*  orchestrated in the media against us. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=271.6s)]
*  That was clear from moment one. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=274.6s)]
*  And what we knew is that it wasn't about me. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=278.78000000000003s)]
*  Most of it was about President Donald Trump, who's had to endure the very same thing for [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=282.04s)]
*  much longer amounts of time, and he endured it in incredibly strong ways. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=286.44s)]
*  So we in some ways knew it was coming. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=291.24s)]
*  We didn't understand the depth of the dishonesty that would come with it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=293.4s)]
*  So from story after story in the media, left-wing media, we saw anonymous source after anonymous [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=297.72s)]
*  source based on second or third-hand accounts. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=304.4s)]
*  And time and time again, stories would come out, and people would reach out to me and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=309.02s)]
*  say, you know, I've spoken to this reporter about who you really are, and I was willing [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=312.92s)]
*  to go on the record. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=317.8s)]
*  But they didn't print my quote. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=320.48s)]
*  They didn't print any of my quotes. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=323.36s)]
*  Or I've worked with you for 10 years, or I was your accountant, or I was your chief operating [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=327.0s)]
*  officer, or I was your board member, or I was with you on 100 different tour stops for [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=331.72s)]
*  Concerned Veterans for America. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=337.24s)]
*  No one called me. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=339.44s)]
*  No one asked about your conduct on the record or off the record. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=342.08s)]
*  Instead, a small handful of anonymous sources were allowed to drive a smear campaign and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=345.64s)]
*  agenda about me because our left-wing media in America today, sadly, doesn't care about [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=352.16s)]
*  the truth. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=357.48s)]
*  All they were out to do, Mr. Chairman, was to destroy me. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=359.68s)]
*  And why do they want to destroy me? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=364.28s)]
*  Because I'm a change agent and a threat to them because Donald Trump was willing to choose [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=365.84s)]
*  to empower me to bring the Defense Department back to what it really should be, which is [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  war fighting. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=374.88s)]
*  But the other factor, too, is you've already disparaged in writing the Geneva Convention, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=375.88s)]
*  the rules of law, all of these things. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=381.76s)]
*  How will you be able to effectively lead a military in which one of the principal elements [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=385.20000000000005s)]
*  is discipline, respectful, lawful authority? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=393.0s)]
*  You have made statements to your platoon after being briefed by a JAG officer. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=396.88s)]
*  Well, by the way, would you explain what a JAG office? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=401.48s)]
*  I don't think I need to, sir. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=405.0s)]
*  Why not? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=409.12s)]
*  Because the men and women watching understand. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=410.6s)]
*  Well, perhaps some of my colleagues don't understand. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=412.88s)]
*  It would be a JAG officer who puts his or her own priorities in front of the war fighters, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=416.96000000000004s)]
*  their promotions, their medals, in front of having the backs of those who are making [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=422.76s)]
*  the tough calls on the front lines. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=426.48s)]
*  Thank you, Senator Reed. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=428.52s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=429.52s)]
*  Thank you, Senator Reed. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=430.52s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=431.52s)]
*  I thought it would be really helpful to better understand your views on women in the military [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=432.52s)]
*  because you've made a number of surprising statements about women serving in the military. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=437.8s)]
*  As recently as November the 7th of 2024 on the Sean Ryan show, you said, and I quote, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=444.76s)]
*  I'm straight up saying that we should not have women in combat roles. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=451.28s)]
*  It hasn't made us more effective. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=455.15999999999997s)]
*  The quote went on a little longer, but that was the gist of it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=457.59999999999997s)]
*  That was before you were nominated to be Secretary of Defense. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=461.96s)]
*  Mr. Hegseth, do you know what percentage of our military is comprised of women? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=466.35999999999996s)]
*  I believe it's 18 to 20 percent, Senator. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=473.64s)]
*  It's almost 18 percent. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=475.65999999999997s)]
*  And in fact, DOD's 2023 demographic report indicated that there are more women serving [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=477.08s)]
*  now and there are fewer separations. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=483.35999999999996s)]
*  So they make up a critical part of our military. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=486.59999999999997s)]
*  Wouldn't you agree? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=488.84s)]
*  Yes ma'am. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=490.84s)]
*  Women in our military, as I have said publicly, have and continue to make amazing contributions [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=491.84s)]
*  across all aspects of our battlefield. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=497.32s)]
*  Well, you also write in your book, The War on Warriors, with the chapter, The Deadly [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=499.91999999999996s)]
*  Obsession with Women Warriors, that quote, not only are women comparatively less effective [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=505.06s)]
*  than men in combat roles, but they are more likely to be objectified by the enemy and [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=510.74s)]
*  their own nation in the moral realms of war. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=516.02s)]
*  Mr. Hegseth, should we take it to believe that you believe that the two women on this [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=519.46s)]
*  committee who have served honorably and with distinction made our military less effective [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=524.42s)]
*  and less capable? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=529.82s)]
*  I'm incredibly grateful for the two women who have served our military in uniform and [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=531.78s)]
*  including in the Central Intelligence Agency contributions on the battlefield, indispensable [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=536.9399999999999s)]
*  contributions. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=543.02s)]
*  Senator, I would like to clarify, when I'm talking about that issue, it's not about the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=544.02s)]
*  capabilities of men and women, it's about standards. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=548.62s)]
*  And this committee has talked a lot about standards. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=551.62s)]
*  Standards that we, unfortunately, over time, have seen eroded in certain duty positions, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=554.06s)]
*  in certain schools, certain places, which affects readiness, which is what I care about [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=560.5s)]
*  the most, readiness on the battlefield. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=564.7s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=565.7s)]
*  And so, to my comments, time and time again, to standards. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=566.7s)]
*  Your statements publicly have not been to that effect. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=570.86s)]
*  After your nomination, you did state to a group of reporters that you, quote, support [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=575.5s)]
*  all women serving in our military today, who do a fantastic job across the globe, including [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=579.28s)]
*  combat. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=585.26s)]
*  So what I'm confused about, Mr. Hegseth, is which is it? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=586.94s)]
*  Why should women in our military, if you were the Secretary of Defense, believe that they [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=591.0200000000001s)]
*  would have a fair shot and an equal opportunity to rise through the ranks? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=596.6600000000001s)]
*  If on the one hand, you say that women are not competent, they make our military less [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=600.5s)]
*  effective, and on the other hand, you say, oh no, now that I've been nominated to be [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=605.82s)]
*  the Secretary of Defense, I've changed my view on women in the military. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=610.62s)]
*  What do you have to say to the almost 400,000 women who are serving today about your position [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=615.14s)]
*  on whether they should be capable to rise through the highest ranks of our military? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=621.54s)]
*  Senator, I would say I would be honored to have the opportunity to serve alongside you, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=626.86s)]
*  shoulder to shoulder, men and women, black, white, all backgrounds, with a shared purpose. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=632.5s)]
*  Our differences are not what define us. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=638.06s)]
*  Our unity and our shared purpose is what define us. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=640.46s)]
*  And you will be treated fairly and with dignity, honor and respect, just like every man and [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=642.94s)]
*  woman in uniform, just like the men and women that I've worked with in my veterans' organizations, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=647.4200000000001s)]
*  to include when I was a headquarters and headquarters company commander in the Minnesota National [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=652.0600000000001s)]
*  Guard. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=655.7800000000001s)]
*  Well, I appreciate your 11th hour conversion, but Mr. Chairman, for the record, I would [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=656.7800000000001s)]
*  like to submit Chapter 5, The Deadly Obsession with Women Warriors, for the record. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=660.94s)]
*  Mr. Hegseth? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=667.3800000000001s)]
*  Without objection, it will be submitted. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=668.3800000000001s)]
*  Are you familiar with the Women, Peace and Security agenda at the Department of Defense? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=671.76s)]
*  Yes, ma'am, I am. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=676.0s)]
*  This is a law that was signed during President-elect Trump's first term. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=678.96s)]
*  It was legislation that I sponsored with Republican Senator Capito of West Virginia. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=682.24s)]
*  It was co-sponsored by Marco Rubio, the nominee to be the president-elect's secretary of [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=687.2s)]
*  state. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=692.0400000000001s)]
*  It was led in the House of Representatives by Kristi Noem, the president-elect's nominee [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=693.0400000000001s)]
*  to be the secretary of Homeland Security. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=696.58s)]
*  It mandates that women be included in all aspects of our national security, including [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=699.48s)]
*  conflict resolution and peace negotiations. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=704.84s)]
*  And at the Department of Defense, it has been the law for eight years under both the Trump [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=708.12s)]
*  and Biden administrations. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=712.88s)]
*  The DOD has incorporated women throughout its decision-making as a result. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=714.6800000000001s)]
*  Every single combatant commander across two administrations has told this committee that [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=720.1800000000001s)]
*  this law and its implementation at the Department of Defense provides them a strategic advantage [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=725.66s)]
*  operationally. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=731.28s)]
*  Based on your comments, it appears that the example that you would like to set, not only [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=733.4599999999999s)]
*  for women in this country, but for women across the globe, 50 percent of the world's population [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=738.3399999999999s)]
*  as the prospective nominee to lead the most combat-credible military in the entire world, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=743.78s)]
*  is that women should not have an equal opportunity in our military. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=751.26s)]
*  So will you commit to preserving the Women, Peace, and Security law at DOD and including [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=757.52s)]
*  in your budget the requisite funding to continue to restore and resource these programs throughout [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=763.22s)]
*  the DOD? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=771.26s)]
*  Senator, I will commit to reviewing that program and ensuring it aligns with America First [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=772.26s)]
*  national security priorities, meritocracy, lethality, and readiness. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=779.32s)]
*  And if it advances American interests, it's something we would advance. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=783.48s)]
*  If it doesn't, it's something we would look at. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=787.2800000000001s)]
*  Former President Trump signed the law. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=790.1600000000001s)]
*  I hope that he agrees with you. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=792.36s)]
*  Mr. Hexeth, let's continue on this line of questioning about what's sometimes referred [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=794.24s)]
*  to as women in combat. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=797.6800000000001s)]
*  I think that phrase is something of a misnomer. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=800.12s)]
*  Many members of this committee have served in combat in the last 25 years to include [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=803.56s)]
*  women and men. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=809.28s)]
*  I'm sure all those men served with women, whether they were military police officers [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=810.5999999999999s)]
*  or they were pilots or whether they were intelligence analysts or medics or what have you. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=815.2199999999999s)]
*  You served. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=820.52s)]
*  I assume you served with women who were on the front lines as well. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=821.52s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=824.3199999999999s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=825.3199999999999s)]
*  And were those women anything other than skilled, brave, and honorable in their service? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=826.3199999999999s)]
*  They were some of the best soldiers I worked with. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=829.88s)]
*  So women have been serving in combat for a long time. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=831.92s)]
*  Women have even been serving in combat units like infantry battalions for a long time in [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=834.04s)]
*  roles like medics or mechanics or what have you. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=838.36s)]
*  So what we're talking about here specifically is women in ground combat roles in jobs like [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=840.9599999999999s)]
*  infantrymen or artillerymen or special forces. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=847.7199999999999s)]
*  Until about 10 years ago, that wasn't the case. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=851.0s)]
*  Under Secretary Panetta, those roles were opened up to women to serve in. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=854.16s)]
*  Has President Trump indicated at all that he plans to rescind or alter that guidance? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=860.92s)]
*  You're correct to point out, Senator, that these are the decisions that the commander [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=866.36s)]
*  in chief will have the prerogative to make. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=869.36s)]
*  He has not indicated to me that he has plans to change whether or not women would have [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=872.04s)]
*  access to these roles. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=877.0s)]
*  However, I would point out ensuring that standards are equal and high is of importance to him [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=878.88s)]
*  and great importance to me. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=885.5s)]
*  Because in those ground combat roles, what is true is that the weight of the ruck on [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=887.46s)]
*  your back doesn't change, the weight of the 155 round that you have to carry doesn't change, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=892.12s)]
*  the weight of the 240 Bravo machine gun you might have to carry doesn't change. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=897.3000000000001s)]
*  And so whether it's a man or a woman, they have to meet the same high standards. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=901.62s)]
*  And Senator, in any place where those things have been eroded or in courses, criteria have [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=906.26s)]
*  been changed in order to meet quotas, racial quotas or gender quotas, that is putting a [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=912.38s)]
*  focus on something other than readiness, standards, meritocracy and lethality. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=920.2s)]
*  So that's the kind of review I'm talking about, not whether women have access to ground combat [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=926.38s)]
*  roles. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=931.3s)]
*  Okay, so thank you. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=932.3s)]
*  We've got a big audience here. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=933.3s)]
*  Many of them seem to be patriotic supporters of you, Mr. Hexette. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=934.3s)]
*  Some of them seem to be liberal critics of you. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=938.02s)]
*  I would note that it's only the liberal critics that have disrupted this hearing. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=940.56s)]
*  As was my custom during the Biden administration, I want to give you a chance to respond to [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=945.52s)]
*  what they said about you. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=951.1999999999999s)]
*  I think the first one accused you of being a Christian Zionist. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=952.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm not really sure why that is a bad thing. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=956.56s)]
*  I'm a Christian, I'm a Zionist. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=959.1999999999999s)]
*  Zionism is that the Jewish people deserve a homeland in the ancient Holy Land where [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=961.36s)]
*  they've lived since the dawn of history. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=968.28s)]
*  Do you consider yourself a Christian Zionist? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=970.1999999999999s)]
*  Senator, I support, I'm a Christian and I robustly support the state of Israel and its [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=972.6s)]
*  existential defense and the way America comes alongside them is a great honor. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=977.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=982.3199999999999s)]
*  Because another one, another protester, and I think this one was a member of Code Pink, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=983.3199999999999s)]
*  which by the way is a Chinese communist front group these days, said that you support Israel's [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=985.88s)]
*  war in Gaza. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=991.88s)]
*  I support Israel's existential war in Gaza. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=994.48s)]
*  I assume, like me and President Trump, you support that war as well, don't you? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=997.12s)]
*  Senator, I do. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1001.16s)]
*  I support Israel destroying and killing every last member of Hamas. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1002.16s)]
*  And the third protester said something about 20 years of genocide. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1007.76s)]
*  I assume that's our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1011.32s)]
*  Do you think our troops are committing genocide in Iraq and Afghanistan? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1013.76s)]
*  Senator, I do not. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1016.92s)]
*  I think our troops, as you know, as so many in this committee know, did the best they [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1018.12s)]
*  could with what they had. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1022.92s)]
*  We're not, the outcomes, and tragically the outcome we saw in Afghanistan under the Biden [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1024.44s)]
*  administration put a stain on that, but it doesn't put a stain on what those men and [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1028.92s)]
*  women did in uniform, as you know, full well. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1032.92s)]
*  Senator. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1035.8s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Exe. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1036.8s)]
*  I have many concerns about your record and particularly your public statements because [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1037.8s)]
*  they are so hurtful to the men and women who are currently serving in the U.S. military, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1043.16s)]
*  harmful to morale, harmful to good order and discipline. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1049.4s)]
*  If you are saying that women shouldn't be serving in the military, and I'm going to [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1053.34s)]
*  read you your quotes because the quotes themselves are terrible, you will have to change how [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1057.26s)]
*  you see women to do this job well, and I don't know if you are capable of that. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1063.1399999999999s)]
*  So I want to press on these issues that my colleague Jean Shaheen brought up because [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1067.62s)]
*  she said it so well. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1071.82s)]
*  So first of all, you answered your questionnaire. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1073.9399999999998s)]
*  Do you believe that any American who wants to serve their country in the military and [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1076.98s)]
*  can meet objective standards set by the military should be allowed to serve without limitation? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1081.6s)]
*  You said yes to that question. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1085.8799999999999s)]
*  But then in all of these other circumstances, you've denigrated active duty service members. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1087.8799999999999s)]
*  We have hundreds, hundreds of women who are currently in the infantry, lethal members [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1093.02s)]
*  of our military serving in the infantry. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1099.6999999999998s)]
*  But you degrade them. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1102.1399999999999s)]
*  You say we need moms, but not in the military, especially in combat units. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1103.52s)]
*  So specific to Senator Cotton's question, because Senator Cotton was giving you layups [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1109.8s)]
*  to differentiate between different types of combat. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1114.76s)]
*  And specifically, as secretary, would you take any action to re-institute the combat [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1118.52s)]
*  arms exclusion for female service members, knowing full well you have hundreds of women [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1124.3999999999999s)]
*  doing that job right now? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1129.36s)]
*  And the standards, your two-mile run, Tom, is about the Army Combat Fitness Test. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1131.36s)]
*  It is not the requirements to have an MOS-11 Bravo, which is the infantry. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1138.2s)]
*  These are the requirements today for people serving in the industry, men and women. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1143.94s)]
*  They are gender neutral, and they are very difficult to meet. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1148.9s)]
*  They have not been reduced in any way. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1152.66s)]
*  And our combat units, our infantry is lethal. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1155.7s)]
*  So please explain specifically, because you will be in charge of three million personnel. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1160.82s)]
*  It is a big job. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1166.9s)]
*  And when you make these public statements, and I get you were not secretary of defense [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1168.98s)]
*  then, I get you were on TV, I get you were helping veterans, I get it was a different [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1172.7s)]
*  job. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1177.02s)]
*  But most recently, you said this in November of 2024, knowing full well you might have [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1178.02s)]
*  been named as secretary of defense. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1182.06s)]
*  So please explain these types of statements, because they're brutal, and they're mean, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1185.34s)]
*  and they disrespect men and women who are willing to die for this country. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1191.04s)]
*  Senator, I appreciate your comments. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1196.16s)]
*  And I would point out I've never disparaged women serving in the military. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1199.18s)]
*  I respect every single female service member that has put on the uniform, past and present. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1203.4s)]
*  My critiques, Senator, recently and in the past, and from personal experience, have been [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1209.74s)]
*  instances where I've seen standards lowered, and you mentioned 11 Alpha, 11 Bravo, MOS, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1214.6200000000001s)]
*  places in units. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1221.6200000000001s)]
*  And the book that has been referenced multiple times here, The War on Warriors, I spent [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1222.9s)]
*  months talking to active duty service members, men and women, low ranks, high ranks, combat [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1228.42s)]
*  arms and not combat arms. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1234.8600000000001s)]
*  And what each and every one of them told me, and what personal instances have shown me, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1236.26s)]
*  is that in ways, direct, indirect, overt and subtle, standards have been changed inside [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1241.26s)]
*  infantry training units, ranger school, infantry battalions, to ensure that commanders meet [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1249.3s)]
*  quotas to have a certain number of female infantry officers or infantry enlisted, and [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1256.3s)]
*  that disparages those women who are incredibly capable of meeting that standard. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1265.3s)]
*  Commanders do not have to have a quota for women in the infantry. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1270.54s)]
*  That does not exist. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1273.68s)]
*  It does not exist. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1275.06s)]
*  And your statements are creating the impression that these exist, because they do not. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1276.4s)]
*  They are not quotas. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1281.3200000000002s)]
*  We want the most lethal force. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1282.3200000000002s)]
*  But I'm telling you, having been here for 15 years listening to testimony about men [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1284.3600000000001s)]
*  and women in combat and the type of operations that were successful in Afghanistan and in [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1289.72s)]
*  Iraq, women were essential for many of those units. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1294.16s)]
*  When ranger units went in to find where the terrorists hiding in Afghanistan or in Iraq, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1297.4s)]
*  in the unit, they could go in, talk to the women in a village, say, where are the terrorists [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1303.74s)]
*  hiding, where are the weapons hiding, and get crucial information to make sure that [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1308.82s)]
*  we can win that battle. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1314.34s)]
*  So just you cannot denigrate women in general. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1316.66s)]
*  And your statements do that. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1319.6200000000001s)]
*  We don't want women in the military, especially in combat. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1321.3s)]
*  What a terrible statement. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1324.6200000000001s)]
*  So please do not deny that you've made those statements you have. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1326.2s)]
*  We take the responsibility of standards very seriously. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1330.14s)]
*  And we will work with you. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1333.5400000000002s)]
*  I'm equally distressed you would not meet with me before this hearing. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1334.5400000000002s)]
*  We could have covered all of this before you came here, so I could get to the 15 other [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1338.1200000000001s)]
*  questions that I want to get to. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1342.6200000000001s)]
*  So women you have denigrated, you have also denigrated members of the LGBTQ community. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1344.7s)]
*  Did you know that when Don't Ask, Don't Tell was in place, we lost so many crucial personnel, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1349.72s)]
*  over a thousand in mission-critical areas. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1355.5800000000002s)]
*  We lost 10% of all our foreign language speakers because of a political policy. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1358.14s)]
*  You said in your statement, you don't want politics in the DOD. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1363.7s)]
*  Everything you've said in these public statements is politics. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1368.1000000000001s)]
*  I don't want women, I don't want moms. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1370.5400000000002s)]
*  What's wrong with a mom, by the way? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1372.5s)]
*  Once you have babies, you therefore are no longer able to be lethal. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1374.14s)]
*  I mean, you're basically saying women, after they have children, can't ever serve in the [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1377.0200000000002s)]
*  military in a combat role. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1381.0600000000002s)]
*  It's a silly thing to say. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1382.38s)]
*  It's a silly thing to say. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1384.5600000000002s)]
*  Beneath the position that you are aspiring to. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1386.02s)]
*  To denigrate LGBTQ service members is a mistake. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1389.1399999999999s)]
*  If you are a sharpshooter, you're as lethal regardless of what your gender identity is, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1393.02s)]
*  regardless of who you love. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1397.62s)]
*  So please know this to be a true statement. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1398.96s)]
*  So you say it was a political thing, you say it undermined us, social engineering. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1402.1s)]
*  I don't know why having someone having to publicly say or not publicly say who they [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1408.86s)]
*  love is social engineering. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1414.9799999999998s)]
*  I think having that policy in the first place was highly problematic. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1417.3799999999999s)]
*  And as you said in your statement, do you agree anybody should be able to serve in the [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1421.2199999999998s)]
*  military if they meet the standards? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1425.58s)]
*  Senator, as the president has stated, I don't disagree with the overturn of Don't Ask, Don't [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1428.02s)]
*  Tell. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1436.2199999999998s)]
*  Because I don't want you thinking can't serve if you're a mom, can't serve if you're LGBTQ. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1437.38s)]
*  And then last, can't serve if you're a leftist. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1442.02s)]
*  The statements you said about people who have views differently than you, that we're the [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1444.98s)]
*  enemy. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1450.1000000000001s)]
*  Are you saying that 50% of the DOD, if they hold liberal views or leftist views or are [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1451.1000000000001s)]
*  Democrats are not welcome in the military? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1455.94s)]
*  Are you saying that? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1459.6200000000001s)]
*  Senator, I volunteered to deploy to Afghanistan under Democrat President Barack Obama. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1461.06s)]
*  I also volunteered to guard the inauguration of Joe Biden, but was denied the opportunity [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1466.66s)]
*  to serve because I was identified as an extremist by my own unit for a Christian tattoo. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1471.3799999999999s)]
*  I want to talk about financial mismanagement at the two organizations that you headed, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1476.62s)]
*  which are the only test of your financial management that we have before this committee, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1483.54s)]
*  the Veterans for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for America. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1490.62s)]
*  You took over the Veterans for Freedom in 2007. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1494.46s)]
*  In 2008, you raised $8.7 million, but spent more than $9 million, creating a deficit. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1500.14s)]
*  By January 2009, you told donors that the organization had less than $1,000 in the bank [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1509.38s)]
*  and debts of $434,000. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1518.8600000000001s)]
*  By 2010, revenue at the Veterans for Freedom had dropped to about $265,000. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1523.94s)]
*  In the next year, it had dropped further to $22,000. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1533.1000000000001s)]
*  You don't dispute these numbers, do you? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1538.1000000000001s)]
*  Senator, I'm extremely proud of the work me and my fellow vets did at Vets for Freedom. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1540.7s)]
*  A bunch of young vets with no political experience, a small group, working hard every single day. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1548.54s)]
*  We raised donor funds, and we have letters submitted for the record from almost everyone [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1557.38s)]
*  that worked with me every single day, including our chief operating officer, who will attest [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1563.42s)]
*  that every dollar we raised was used intentionally toward the execution of our mission, which [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1567.58s)]
*  is supporting the war fighters, exactly why we're here today. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1574.14s)]
*  The war fighters in the Iraq surge. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1577.26s)]
*  There was a campaign in 2008, Senator. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1579.74s)]
*  It was Barack Obama versus John McCain. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1582.02s)]
*  We believe John McCain would be the right person to win. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1584.02s)]
*  And so we spent more. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1586.66s)]
*  I have the tax returns from that organization. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1587.66s)]
*  I'm glad they're in for the record. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1590.02s)]
*  Which I am going to ask to be entered into the record, Mr. Chairman. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1591.02s)]
*  Without objection. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1595.3s)]
*  These tax returns are yours. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1596.34s)]
*  They have your signature. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1599.62s)]
*  And I'm going to ask that members of the committee review them, because they're the only documents [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1602.26s)]
*  I've asked for others. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1606.42s)]
*  I've asked for the FBI report that would presumably document, it should have documented, this [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1609.38s)]
*  kind of financial mismanagement. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1616.5800000000002s)]
*  And these are the 990s from that organization. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1619.7s)]
*  By the year of 2011, donors had become so dissatisfied with that mismanagement, they [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1626.42s)]
*  In fact ousted you. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1634.5s)]
*  They merged that organization with Military Families United. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1635.98s)]
*  And thereafter, you joined a second organization as executive director. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1641.9s)]
*  In between, Senator, I went to Harvard University for a few years and at Gansan. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1647.5s)]
*  I want to ask you questions about Concerned Veterans for America. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1651.42s)]
*  Again, another set of tax returns. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1654.8600000000001s)]
*  The 990s from that organization. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1657.3000000000002s)]
*  I ask they be made part of the record, Mr. Chairman. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1659.66s)]
*  Without objection, both of those returns are now part of the record. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1662.38s)]
*  2011 to 2016. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1665.98s)]
*  At the end of 2013, shortfall of $130,000. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1670.94s)]
*  At the end of 2014, shortfall of $428,000. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1674.94s)]
*  You had a surplus the following year, but then another deficit of $437,000. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1679.98s)]
*  By the time you left, that organization had deep debts, including credit card transaction [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1686.58s)]
*  debts of about $75,000. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1694.3s)]
*  That isn't the kind of fiscal management we want at the Department of Defense. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1698.22s)]
*  We can't tolerate it at the Department of Defense. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1702.3s)]
*  That's an organization with a budget of $850 billion. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1706.58s)]
*  About $10 or $15 million, which was the case at those two organizations. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1715.02s)]
*  It has command responsibility for 3.4 million Americans. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1720.66s)]
*  The highest number that you managed in those two organizations was maybe 50 people. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1726.1399999999999s)]
*  Let me ask you, how many men and women now serve in the United States Army? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1734.42s)]
*  What is Sen's strength? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1739.86s)]
*  Senator, I would like the opportunity to respond to the impugning of my leadership of a veterans [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1741.6999999999998s)]
*  organization. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1748.3s)]
*  Concerned Veterans for America. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1749.3s)]
*  You're on the VA committee, sir, and I appreciate your service there. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1750.3s)]
*  The VA Accountability Act and the Mission Act were all brainchilds of Concerned Veterans [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1754.3799999999999s)]
*  for America. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1760.6999999999998s)]
*  We used our donor money very intentionally and focused to create policy that bettered [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1761.6999999999998s)]
*  the lives of veterans. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1766.82s)]
*  Mr. Hegseth, I'm asking you a very simple question. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1768.74s)]
*  How many men and women currently serve in the United States Army? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1773.02s)]
*  Senator, the United States Army, 450,000 on active duty, sir. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1776.86s)]
*  And how many in the Navy? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1781.04s)]
*  And the Navy is 425, sir. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1783.98s)]
*  Well, it's 337 this year. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1785.98s)]
*  How many in the Marine Corps? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1789.22s)]
*  175,000, sir. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1790.94s)]
*  172,300. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1793.94s)]
*  Those numbers dwarf any experience you had by many multiples. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1796.3s)]
*  I don't believe that you can tell this committee or the people of America that you are qualified [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1804.6599999999999s)]
*  to lead them. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1812.02s)]
*  I would support you as the spokesperson for the Pentagon. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1813.06s)]
*  I don't dispute your communication skills, but I believe that we are entitled to the [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1820.7s)]
*  facts here. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1826.8200000000002s)]
*  I've asked for more documents. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1827.8200000000002s)]
*  I assume you'd be willing to submit to an expanded FBI background check that interviews [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1829.5s)]
*  your colleagues, accountants, ex-wives, former spouses, sexual assault survivors, and others, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1835.66s)]
*  and enable them to come forward. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1844.9s)]
*  Senator, I'm not in charge of FBI background checks. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1847.78s)]
*  But you would submit to it and support it. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1850.78s)]
*  I'm not in charge of FBI background checks. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1854.7s)]
*  Thank you, Senator Blumenthal. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1856.8999999999999s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Hegseth, and thank you very much. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1859.26s)]
*  I appreciate your service to our nation. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1863.18s)]
*  It's something that I know you are very proud of, and it is something that we have in common [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1866.7s)]
*  and that we share. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1871.8999999999999s)]
*  You and I have had many productive conversations. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1874.42s)]
*  And just for our audience, we have had very frank conversations. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1880.38s)]
*  Is that correct, Mr. Hegseth? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1886.42s)]
*  Senator, that is a correct characterization. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1888.18s)]
*  You know that I don't keep anything hidden, pull no punches. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1890.5s)]
*  My colleagues know that as well. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1897.38s)]
*  So I do appreciate you sitting down and allowing me the opportunity to question you thoroughly [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1899.7s)]
*  on those issues that are of great importance to me. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1905.0600000000002s)]
*  Just to recap those issues, three that are very important. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1909.14s)]
*  One is the DOD and making sure that we have a clean audit. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1913.5800000000002s)]
*  The second is women in combat, and we'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1919.14s)]
*  And the third was maintaining high standards and making sure that we are combating sexual [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1926.82s)]
*  assault in the military. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1932.46s)]
*  So Mr. Hegseth, I'm going to address the issue because this will tie into some of the financial [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1935.86s)]
*  concerns that have been raised here as well. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1941.8999999999999s)]
*  And it's why, you know, I'm trusting my fellow Iowan, asked for unanimous consent of his [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1944.54s)]
*  letter to go into the record. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1950.78s)]
*  Like me, a lot of Iowans are really, really concerned and upset about the wasteful Washington [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1953.38s)]
*  spending and, of course, in our Pentagon. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1960.46s)]
*  It's an issue that I have been combating for years. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1963.42s)]
*  So there's significant room for greater efficiency and cost-cutting within the department. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1967.1000000000001s)]
*  And the DOD is the only federal agency that has never passed an audit. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1972.6200000000001s)]
*  As the Senate Doge Caucus Chair and Founder, that's unacceptable to me, and it should be [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1980.26s)]
*  unacceptable to you as well. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1986.06s)]
*  So I appreciate that you mentioned that in your opening statement. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1988.46s)]
*  What are those steps that you will take to ensuring the Pentagon has a clean audit by [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1992.7s)]
*  the year 2028? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1997.98s)]
*  Senator, I appreciate your work on this topic, which you've been involved in for a long time. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=1999.46s)]
*  You mentioned Concerned Veterans for America. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2004.74s)]
*  I just want to clarify, we have very generous donors who set a very clear budget that we [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2008.3s)]
*  stuck to every single year. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2012.98s)]
*  So the latitude there was restricted and we worked very hard and diligently inside it. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2014.7s)]
*  You've also been a leader on the Pentagon audit for a very long time. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2019.8999999999999s)]
*  I think when we met, Senator, I said 2014 was the first year. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2023.5s)]
*  We discovered a 2013 op-ed I wrote about the need for a Pentagon audit because an audit [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2027.02s)]
*  is an issue of national security and frankly, respect to American taxpayers who give $850 [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2033.1s)]
*  billion over to the Defense Department and expect that we know where that money goes. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2039.1799999999998s)]
*  And if that money is going somewhere that doesn't add to tooth and instead goes to fat [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2045.06s)]
*  or tail, we need to know that. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2049.94s)]
*  Or if it's wasted, we need to know that. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2051.62s)]
*  So I think previous Secretaries of Defense, with all due respect, haven't necessarily [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2053.18s)]
*  emphasized the strategic prerogative of an audit. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2058.02s)]
*  And myself, my deputy, Sec. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2063.02s)]
*  F., and others already know that a Pentagon audit will be the comptroller, others central [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2065.42s)]
*  to ensuring we find those dollars that can be used elsewhere legally under the law inside [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2071.06s)]
*  the Pentagon. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2076.7s)]
*  So you have my word, it will be a priority. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2077.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2079.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2080.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2081.18s)]
*  Moving on to women in combat. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2082.18s)]
*  And I had the privilege of serving in uniform for over 23 years between our Army Reserves [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2084.02s)]
*  and our Iowa Army National Guard. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2090.22s)]
*  Did serve in Kuwait and missions in Iraq. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2093.14s)]
*  And so it is incredibly important that I stress and I hope that if confirmed, you continue [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2097.28s)]
*  that every man and woman has opportunity to serve their country in uniform and do so at [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2107.18s)]
*  any level as long as they are meeting the standards that are set forward. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2115.2999999999997s)]
*  And we talked about that in my office. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2121.94s)]
*  I do believe in high standards. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2124.74s)]
*  Now I was denied the opportunity to serve in any combat role because I have a lot of [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2127.82s)]
*  gray hair. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2137.6200000000003s)]
*  And the policy has changed since then. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2138.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2141.1800000000003s)]
*  So I've been around for quite a while. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2142.1800000000003s)]
*  But for the young women that are out there now and can meet those standards, and again, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2143.9s)]
*  I'll emphasize they should be very, very high standards. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2150.1400000000003s)]
*  They must physically be able to achieve those standards so that they can complete their [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2154.22s)]
*  mission. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2160.3399999999997s)]
*  But I want to know, again, let's make it very clear for everyone here today. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2162.3399999999997s)]
*  As Secretary of Defense, will you support women continuing to have the opportunity to [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2168.12s)]
*  serve in combat roles? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2173.3199999999997s)]
*  Senator, first of all, thank you for your service as we discussed extensively as well. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2175.98s)]
*  It's my privilege. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2181.02s)]
*  And my answer is yes, exactly the way that you caveated it. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2182.44s)]
*  Yes, women will have access to ground combat roles, combat roles, given the standards remain [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2186.6s)]
*  high and we'll have a review to ensure the standards have not been eroded. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2192.84s)]
*  In any one of these cases, that'll be part of one of the first things we do at the Pentagon [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2198.8s)]
*  is reviewing that in a gender neutral way, the standards ensuring readiness and meritocracy [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2202.8s)]
*  is front and center. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2209.48s)]
*  Absolutely, it would be the privilege of a lifetime to, if confirmed, to be the Secretary [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2210.7599999999998s)]
*  of Defense for all men and women in uniform who fight so heroically. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2216.68s)]
*  They have so many other options. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2221.04s)]
*  They decide to put their right hand up for our country and it would be an honor to have [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2222.96s)]
*  a chance to lead them. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2227.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2228.12s)]
*  And just very briefly, we only have less than a minute left, but we have also discussed [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2229.12s)]
*  this in my office. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2234.2s)]
*  The priority of mine has been combating sexual assault in the military and making sure that [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2235.2s)]
*  all of our service members are treated with dignity and respect. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2242.0s)]
*  This has been so important. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2248.9199999999996s)]
*  Senator Gillibrand and I have worked on this and we were able to get changes made to the [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2250.96s)]
*  Uniform Code of Military Justice to make sure that we have improvements and on how we address [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2256.7999999999997s)]
*  the tragic and life altering issues of rape, sexual assault. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2264.88s)]
*  It will demand time and attention from the Pentagon under your watch if you are confirmed. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2272.2400000000002s)]
*  So as Secretary of Defense, will you appoint a senior level official dedicated to sexual [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2278.0s)]
*  assault prevention and response? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2283.84s)]
*  Senator, as we have discussed, yes I will. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2286.0s)]
*  I am focused on your fitness to serve, including your character and temperament and your overall [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2289.24s)]
*  qualifications to do the job. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2295.2799999999997s)]
*  And I do appreciate the comments of ranking member Reed with his concerns regarding your [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2297.9599999999996s)]
*  nomination because I share those concerns. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2304.2799999999997s)]
*  As part of my responsibility as a member of this committee to ensure the fitness of all [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2307.72s)]
*  nominees to come before any of the committees on which I sit, I ask the following two initial [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2311.7999999999997s)]
*  questions. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2317.24s)]
*  First, since you became a legal adult, have you ever made unwanted requests for sexual [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2318.3199999999997s)]
*  favors or committed any verbal or physical harassment or assault of a sexual nature? [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2324.16s)]
*  No, Senator. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2330.4799999999996s)]
*  Have you ever faced discipline or entered into a settlement relating to this kind of conduct? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2332.56s)]
*  Senator, I was falsely accused in October of 2017. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2337.7599999999998s)]
*  It was fully investigated and I was completely cleared. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2344.72s)]
*  I don't think completely cleared is accurate, but the fact is that your own lawyer said [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2348.08s)]
*  that you entered into an NDA and paid a person who accused you of raping her some money to [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2357.64s)]
*  make sure that she did not file a complaint. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2366.24s)]
*  Moving on, as Secretary, you will be in charge of maintaining good order and discipline by [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2369.84s)]
*  enforcing the Uniform Code of Military Justice, UCMJ, in addition to the sexual assault allegations. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2375.56s)]
*  By the way, the answer to my second question should have been yes. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2382.52s)]
*  I have read multiple reports of your regularly being drunk at work, including by people who [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2386.2s)]
*  worked with you at Fox News. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2393.08s)]
*  Do you know that being drunk at work is prohibited for service members under the UCMJ? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2395.08s)]
*  Senator, those are multiple false anonymous reports peddled by NBC News that run directly [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2400.76s)]
*  contradictory to the dozens of men and women at Fox News Channel who I work with who came [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2408.76s)]
*  on the record and said they could never see my work. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2414.6000000000004s)]
*  In your opening statement, Mr. Hicks, you commit to holding leaders accountable at all [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2417.7200000000003s)]
*  levels. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2421.88s)]
*  That includes you, of course. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2422.6800000000003s)]
*  And frankly, as Secretary, you will be on the job 24-7. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2424.68s)]
*  You recently promised some of my Republican colleagues that you stopped drinking and won't [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2430.52s)]
*  drink if confirmed, correct? [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2437.24s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2441.24s)]
*  Will you resign as Secretary of Defense if you drink on the job, which is a 24-7 position? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2442.7599999999998s)]
*  I've made this commitment on behalf of many women serving. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2449.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm not hearing an answer to my question, so I'm going to move on. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2452.68s)]
*  While you have made that commitment, you will not commit to resigning if you drink on the job. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2462.68s)]
*  As Secretary of Defense, you will swear an oath to the Constitution and not an oath to any [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2467.64s)]
*  man, woman, or president, correct? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2474.7599999999998s)]
*  Senator, on multiple occasions, including as a young second lieutenant, I have sworn an [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2477.48s)]
*  oath to the Constitution and I'm proud to do so. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2482.12s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2484.04s)]
*  In June of 2020, then-President Trump directed former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper to shoot [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2484.92s)]
*  protesters in the legs in downtown D.C. An order Secretary Esper refused to comply with. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2491.16s)]
*  Would you carry out such an order from President Trump? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2498.7599999999998s)]
*  Senator, I was in the Washington, D.C. National Guard unit that was in Lafayette Square during [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2503.48s)]
*  those events holding a riot shield on behalf of my country. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2508.92s)]
*  I saw 50 Secret Service agents get injured by rioters trying to jump over the fence, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2513.16s)]
*  set the church on fire, and destroy a statue. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2518.76s)]
*  That sounds to me that you will comply with such an order. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2520.92s)]
*  You will shoot protesters in the leg. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2523.48s)]
*  Moving on. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2526.76s)]
*  President Ullick has attacked our allies in recent weeks, refusing to rule out using military [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2527.88s)]
*  force to take over Greenland and the Panama Canal and threatening to take to make Canada [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2534.44s)]
*  the 51st state. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2541.48s)]
*  Would you carry out an order from President Trump to seize Greenland, a territory of our [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2543.0s)]
*  NATO ally Denmark, by force? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2548.12s)]
*  Or would you comply with an order to take over the Panama Canal? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2551.48s)]
*  Senator, I will emphasize that President Trump received 77 million votes to be the lawful [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2556.92s)]
*  commander in chief of this country. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2562.12s)]
*  We're not talking about the election. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2562.36s)]
*  My question is, would you use our military to take over Greenland or an ally of Denmark? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2563.96s)]
*  Senator, one of the things that President Trump is so good at is never strategically [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2576.28s)]
*  tipping his hand. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2579.64s)]
*  And so I would never in this public forum give one way or another to direct what orders [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2580.6s)]
*  the president would give me in any context. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2585.16s)]
*  That sounds to me that you would contemplate carrying out such an order to basically invade [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2587.16s)]
*  Greenland and take over the Panama Canal. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2591.96s)]
*  Current DOD policy allows service members and eligible dependents to be reimbursed for [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2597.16s)]
*  travel associated with non-covered reproductive health care, including abortions. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2603.48s)]
*  Will you maintain this common sense policy? [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2609.0s)]
*  Senator, I've always been personally pro-life. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2612.2s)]
*  I know President Trump has as well, and we will review all policies. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2615.08s)]
*  But our standard is whatever the president wants on this particular issue. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2619.32s)]
*  So if the president tells you that this policy will not be maintained, you will not [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2623.2400000000002s)]
*  enable our service members to seek reproductive care. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2630.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't believe the federal government should be funding travel for abortion. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2635.48s)]
*  I just want to note that the other area that was of serious concern to me is President [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2640.44s)]
*  Trump saying that he wants to use the military to help with mass deportations, which will cost [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2645.48s)]
*  billions of dollars. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2651.1600000000003s)]
*  And what that will do to readiness is very, very concerning. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2652.6800000000003s)]
*  Mr. Hexley, I have noticed a disturbing pattern. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2659.1600000000003s)]
*  You previously have made a series of inflammatory statements about women in combat, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2664.04s)]
*  LGBTQ service members, Muslim Americans, and Democrats. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2669.48s)]
*  Since your nominations, however, you have walked those back on TV and interviews, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2675.2400000000002s)]
*  and most recently in your opening statements. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2681.2400000000002s)]
*  You are no longer on Fox and Friends, Mr. Hexley. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2684.12s)]
*  If confirmed, your words, actions, and decisions will have real impacts on national security [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2687.8s)]
*  and our service members' lives. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2694.84s)]
*  There are close to three million personnel in the Department of Defense, $900 billion [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2696.6s)]
*  budget. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2703.96s)]
*  I hardly think you are prepared to do the job. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2706.2s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Hexley. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2709.56s)]
*  Senator, thank you. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2710.36s)]
*  That wasn't a question, Mr. Hexley. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2712.12s)]
*  I want to return to the incident that you referenced a minute ago that occurred in [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2714.2799999999997s)]
*  Monterey, California in October 2017. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2718.36s)]
*  At that time, you were still married to your second wife, correct? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2720.92s)]
*  I believe so. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2726.6s)]
*  And you had just fathered a child by a woman who would later become your third wife, correct? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2727.72s)]
*  Senator, I was falsely charged, fully investigated, and completely cleared. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2732.92s)]
*  So you think you are completely cleared because you committed no crime. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2738.8399999999997s)]
*  That's your definition of cleared. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2742.2s)]
*  You had just fathered a child two months before by a woman that was not your wife. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2743.96s)]
*  I am shocked that you would stand here and say you're completely cleared. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2749.0s)]
*  Can you so casually cheat on a second wife and cheat on the mother of a child that had [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2753.64s)]
*  been born two months before and you tell us you were completely cleared? [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2759.48s)]
*  How is that a complete clear? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2763.3199999999997s)]
*  Senator, her child's name is Gwendolyn Hope Hegseth, and she's a child of God, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2765.08s)]
*  and she's seven years old. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2769.72s)]
*  And she was, and you cheated on the mother of that child less than two months after that [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2770.92s)]
*  daughter was born, didn't you? [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2775.7999999999997s)]
*  Those were false charges? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2778.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, no. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2779.72s)]
*  Fully investigated, and that was completely cleared. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2780.12s)]
*  And I'm so grateful for the marriage I have to this amazing woman behind me. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2782.28s)]
*  You've admitted that you had sex at that hotel on October 2017. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2786.6000000000004s)]
*  You've said it was consensual, isn't that correct? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2791.96s)]
*  You've admitted that it was consensual, and you were still married, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2797.0800000000004s)]
*  and you just had a child by another woman. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2799.88s)]
*  Again. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2801.88s)]
*  How do you explain your judgment? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2802.28s)]
*  Completely false charges against me. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2803.48s)]
*  Fully investigated, and I was completely cleared. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2805.88s)]
*  You have admitted that you had sex while you were married to wife two after you just had [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2807.96s)]
*  fathered a child by wife three. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2812.52s)]
*  You've admitted that. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2814.68s)]
*  Now, if it had been a sexual assault, that would be disqualifying to be Secretary of Defense, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2815.8s)]
*  wouldn't it? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2820.28s)]
*  It was a false claim then and a false claim now. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2821.96s)]
*  If it had been a sexual assault, that would be disqualifying to be Secretary of Defense, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2824.12s)]
*  wouldn't it? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2829.88s)]
*  That was a false claim. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2831.64s)]
*  So you can't- [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2833.32s)]
*  Talking about a hypothetical. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2833.7200000000003s)]
*  So you can't tell me whether someone who has committed a sexual assault is disqualified [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2834.84s)]
*  from being Secretary of Defense? [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2840.92s)]
*  Senator, I know in my instance, and I'm talking about my instance only, it was a false claim. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2842.84s)]
*  But you acknowledge- [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2848.36s)]
*  And it was fully investigated. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2849.08s)]
*  But you acknowledge that you cheated on your wife [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2849.88s)]
*  and that you cheated on the woman by whom you had just fathered a child. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2852.6000000000004s)]
*  You have admitted that. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2856.52s)]
*  I will allow your words to speak for themselves. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2858.6800000000003s)]
*  You're not retracting that today. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2860.36s)]
*  That's good. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2861.6400000000003s)]
*  I assume that in each of your weddings, you've pledged to be faithful to your wife. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2862.04s)]
*  You've taken an oath to do that, haven't you? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2866.04s)]
*  Senator, as I've acknowledged to everyone in this committee, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2868.68s)]
*  I'm not a perfect person, not claiming to be- [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2872.04s)]
*  No, I just asked a simple question. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2873.72s)]
*  You've taken an oath like you would take an oath to be Secretary of Defense [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2875.16s)]
*  on all of your weddings to be faithful to your wife. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2878.2799999999997s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2880.04s)]
*  I have failed in things in my life, and thankfully, I'm redeemed by my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2882.04s)]
*  In finalizing divorces from your first and second wives, were there non-disclosure agreements in [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2886.68s)]
*  connection with those divorces? [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2891.4s)]
*  Senator, not that I'm aware of. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2893.8s)]
*  If there were, would you agree to release those first and second wives from any confidentiality [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2896.04s)]
*  agreement? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2901.0s)]
*  Senator, it's not something I'm aware of. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2901.48s)]
*  But if there were, you would agree to release them from a confidentiality agreement? [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2903.8s)]
*  Senator, that's not my responsibility. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2907.08s)]
*  Did you ever engage in any acts of physical violence against any of your wives? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2909.08s)]
*  Senator, absolutely not. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2913.1600000000003s)]
*  But you would agree with me that if someone had committed physical violence against a spouse, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2915.2400000000002s)]
*  that would be disqualifying to serve as Secretary of Defense, correct? [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2919.16s)]
*  Senator, absolutely not. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2923.0s)]
*  Have I ever done that? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2925.16s)]
*  You would agree that that would be a disqualifying offense, would you not? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2926.2s)]
*  Senator, you're talking about a hypothetical. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2930.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't think it's a hypothetical. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2933.8799999999997s)]
*  Violence against spouses occurs every day. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2936.2799999999997s)]
*  And if you as a leader are not capable of saying that physical violence against a spouse [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2939.16s)]
*  should be a disqualifying fact for being Secretary of the most powerful nation in the world, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2944.84s)]
*  you're demonstrating an astonishing lack of judgment. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2951.4s)]
*  The incident in Monterey led to a criminal charge, a criminal investigation, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2955.32s)]
*  a private settlement, and a cash payment to the woman who filed the complaint. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2958.84s)]
*  And there was also a non-disclosure agreement, correct? [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2963.2400000000002s)]
*  It was a confidential settlement agreement off of a nuisance lawsuit. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2967.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2971.6400000000003s)]
*  During an interview, you claimed that you settled the matter because you were worried that [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2972.7s)]
*  if it became public, it might hurt your career. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2976.3799999999997s)]
*  Do you maintain that you were blackmailed? [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2978.46s)]
*  Senator, I maintain that false claims were made against me. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2981.42s)]
*  And ultimately, those false claims, I had the opportunity to attest my innocence in those false claims. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2985.5s)]
*  But you didn't reveal any of this to President Trump or the transition team as they were [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2991.9s)]
*  considering you to be nominated for Secretary of Defense. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=2996.22s)]

*  you didn't reveal the criminal investigation, you didn't reveal the settlement, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3004.2999999999997s)]
*  you didn't reveal the cash payment. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3008.54s)]
*  Why didn't you inform the commander in chief of the transition team of this very relevant event? [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3010.38s)]
*  Senator, I've appreciated every part of the process with the transition team. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3018.14s)]
*  They have been open and honest with me. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3021.9s)]

*  And I appreciate the opportunity that President-elect Trump- [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3026.38s)]
*  You chose not to reveal this, right? [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3030.14s)]
*  Because you knew it would hurt your chances. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3032.38s)]
*  So you chose not to reveal this really important thing to the commander in chief of the transition [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3034.86s)]
*  team because you were worried about your chances rather than trying to be candid [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3040.3s)]
*  with the future president of the United States. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3044.54s)]

*  and his team as they were considering you to be Secretary of Defense? [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3052.3s)]
*  Senator, I sit here before you in open book as everyone who's watched this process. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3055.6600000000003s)]

*  They're not anonymous. And I'll just conclude and say this to the Chairman. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3157.82s)]
*  You claimed that this was all anonymous. We have seen records with names attached to all of these, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3162.46s)]
*  including the name of your own mother. So don't make this into some anonymous press thing. We [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3168.46s)]
*  have seen multiple names of colleagues consistently throughout your career that have talked about your [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3174.3s)]
*  abusive actions- [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3179.6600000000003s)]
*  Chairman, I think he's over his time. He's way over his time. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3180.86s)]
*  I now yield. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3183.5s)]
*  So if you're confirmed as Secretary of Defense, you will oversee our military, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3185.5800000000004s)]
*  including about a quarter of a million women who currently serve on active duty in the Army, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3189.34s)]
*  the Navy, the Air Force, the Space Forces, and the Marines. And I have serious concerns that [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3194.6200000000003s)]
*  your behavior toward women disqualifies you from serving in this role. Now, I've been trying to get [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3200.3s)]
*  answers from you for quite some time on this. You haven't wanted to meet or to answer any of my [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3206.7000000000003s)]
*  questions. So we'll just have to do it here and dive in. I want to pick up on some of the questions [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3212.06s)]
*  asked by Senators Shaheen and Gillibrand and Gerono, and I just want to make sure we have a [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3217.8999999999996s)]
*  list of some of the facts that I think are undisputed. I'm not going to talk about anonymous [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3222.54s)]
*  sources. I'm just going to quote you directly. We've got the video. We've got it in print. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3226.7s)]
*  So going back to January 2013, you told a Fox News interviewer that women in the military simply [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3232.14s)]
*  couldn't measure up to men in the military, saying that allowing women to serve in combat roles [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3238.54s)]
*  would force the military to lower the bar. You picked up on that same theme in 2015, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3243.58s)]
*  making remarks on Fox News, referring to women in combat as, quote, erode, it would erode standards. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3249.5s)]
*  June 2024, you said on Ben Shapiro's podcast, quote, women shouldn't be in combat at all. And [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3257.58s)]
*  then, of course, we've talked about it in 2024. You published a book, and you say on page 26 of [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3267.34s)]
*  your book, we need moms, but not in the military, especially in combat units. Page 48 of your book, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3273.58s)]
*  you claim that women should not be in combat roles because men are distracted by women. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3282.3s)]
*  And then 10 weeks ago, you appeared on The Sean Ryan Show and said, I'm straight up just saying [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3290.2200000000003s)]
*  we should not have women in combat roles. Now, I presume you recall making all these statements? [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3296.86s)]
*  Senator, I'm not familiar with the article you're pointing to in 2013, but it underscores my argument [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3304.7000000000003s)]
*  completely because in that 2013 argument, I was talking about standards. Standards are what it's [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3310.1400000000003s)]
*  always been about. Let's not have this same fight again. Always been about Senate standards. I've quoted you [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3315.5s)]
*  directly. We've got the video. We're happy to show it. But I want to be clear here. For 12 years, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3319.26s)]
*  you were quite open about your views, and your views were consistently the same. Women are [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3325.58s)]
*  inferior soldiers, sailors, Marines, airmen, and guardians. And in case anyone missed the point, [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3331.02s)]
*  and these are your words from 10 weeks ago, women absolutely straight up should not be permitted to [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3337.8199999999997s)]
*  serve in combat. And I notice on each of these quotes, those are said without qualification. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3346.22s)]
*  It's not by how much you can lift or how fast you can run. They don't belong in combat, period, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3351.98s)]
*  or your words straight up. And then on November 9th, 2024, just 32 days after your last public [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3359.9s)]
*  comment saying that women absolutely should not be in combat, you declared that quote, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3369.26s)]
*  some of our greatest warriors are women, and you support having them serve in combat. Now, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3375.2599999999998s)]
*  that is a very, very big about face in a very, very short period of time. So help me understand, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3383.8199999999997s)]
*  Mr. Hagstaff, what extraordinary event happened in that 32-day period that made you change the core [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3394.06s)]
*  values you had expressed for the preceding 12 years? Senator, again, I very much appreciate [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3406.54s)]
*  you bringing up my comments from 2013, because for me, this issue has always been about standards. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3415.98s)]
*  And unfortunately, because of some of the people that have been in political power for the last [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3423.1s)]
*  four years, priorities other than standards, lethality, and meritocracy have driven decision [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3427.5s)]
*  making. I'm quoting you from the podcast. Women shouldn't be in combat at all. Where is the [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3433.66s)]
*  reference to standards that they should be there if they can carry, if they can run? I don't see [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3442.54s)]
*  that at all, Mr. Hagstaff. What I see is that there's a 32-day period in which you suddenly [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3448.86s)]
*  have another description about your views of women in the military. And I just want to know, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3456.94s)]
*  what changed in the 32 days that the song you sang is not the song you come in here today to sing? [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3463.6600000000003s)]
*  Senator, the concerns I have and the concerns that many have had, especially in ground combat units, [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3472.1400000000003s)]
*  is that in pursuit of certain percentages or quotas, standards have been changed. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3477.42s)]
*  And that makes the combat more difficult for everybody involved. Let me make a suggestion [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3482.54s)]
*  about what happened in that 32 days. You got a nomination from President Trump. Now, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3485.82s)]
*  I've heard of deathbed conversions, but this is the first time I've heard of a nomination conversion. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3491.58s)]
*  And I hope you understand that many women serving in the military right now might think that if you [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3498.2200000000003s)]
*  can convert so rapidly your long-held and aggressively pursued views in just 32 days, [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3505.58s)]
*  that 32 days after you get confirmed, maybe you'll just reverse those views and go back to the old [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3515.02s)]
*  guy who said, straight up, women do not belong in combat. Now, Mr. Hagstaff, you have written that [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3521.66s)]
*  after they retire, generals should be banned from working for the defense industry for 10 years. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3529.58s)]
*  You and I agree on the corrosive effects of the revolving door between the Pentagon and defense [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3535.66s)]
*  contractors. It's something I would have liked to talk to you about if you'd come and been willing [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3541.82s)]
*  to visit with me. But the question I have for you on this is, will you put your money where your mouth [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3546.7s)]
*  is and agree that when you leave this job, you will not work for the defense industry for 10 years? [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3551.66s)]
*  Senator, it's not even a question I've thought about because it's not one that... [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3559.5s)]
*  Think about it right now. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3562.3s)]
*  It's not one... My motivation for this job has never been about what could conceivably come next. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3563.66s)]
*  I understand that. I just need a yes or no here. Time is short. I just need a yes or no. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3570.46s)]
*  I would consult with the president about what the policy should be at the defense department. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3572.78s)]
*  In other words, you're quite sure that every general who serves should not go directly into [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3574.86s)]
*  the defense industry for 10 years, but you're not willing to make that same pledge? [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3583.26s)]
*  I'm not a general, Senator. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3587.42s)]
*  You'll be the one... Let us just be clear, in charge of the generals. So you're saying [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3592.54s)]
*  sauce for the goose, but certainly not sauce for the candor? [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3599.7400000000002s)]
*  I would want to see what the policy of the president is. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3603.26s)]
*  Oh, I'll bet you would. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3604.54s)]
*  Mr. Hex, at this hearing is about whether you are qualified to be secretary of defense. And one of [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3606.3s)]
*  the qualifications to answer my colleague's question is to actually win the votes of every [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3611.34s)]
*  member of this committee and to be confirmed by the United States Senate. And you need to convince [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3615.98s)]
*  us that you're worthy of that vote, because the people of the state of Illinois voted for me to [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3620.62s)]
*  be their senator so that I could cast that vote when it comes to picking who is going to be the [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3624.62s)]
*  next secretary of defense. This hearing now seems to be a hearing about whether or not women are [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3629.82s)]
*  qualified to serve in combat and not about whether or not you are qualified to be secretary of [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3634.78s)]
*  defense. And let me just say that the American people need a sec def who's ready to lead on [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3639.58s)]
*  day one. You are not that person. Our adversaries watch closely during times of transition, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3644.22s)]
*  and any sense that the department of defense that keeps us safe is being steered by someone [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3649.8999999999996s)]
*  who's wholly unprepared for the job puts America at risk. And I am not willing to do that. With [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3654.06s)]
*  that in mind, Mr. Hex, I want you to try to explain to the American people, this committee, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3660.06s)]
*  who have to vote for you, and to our troops who are deployed around the world, why you are qualified [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3664.8599999999997s)]
*  to lead the department of defense. We already know that you've only led the largest of 200 [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3669.98s)]
*  person organization. We already know that you so badly mangled a budget that after you left, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3674.14s)]
*  they had to bring in a forensic accountant to figure out what went wrong. And the largest [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3680.94s)]
*  budget you ever managed was about $18 billion. You know, that is about 51,560 times fewer, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3686.3799999999997s)]
*  lower than the department of defense budget of $825 billion. $16 million is $51,560,000 [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3695.18s)]
*  smaller than the defense budget. Please describe to me, Mr. Hex, that you talk about DOD passing an [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3705.1s)]
*  audit. Please describe to me a time or an organization when you, that you led, underwent [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3711.02s)]
*  an audit. Because you say you're going to hire smarter people than you to run this audit. I'm [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3719.02s)]
*  not asking you to be an accountant. I want you to be able to tell me what kind of guidance will be [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3723.2599999999998s)]
*  given to those employees. What will happen if, whether or not you pass that audit? Have you led [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3728.3s)]
*  an audit of any organization? Yes or no? I don't want a long answer. Yes or no? Have you led an [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3733.82s)]
*  audit of any organization of which you were in charge? Senator, in both of the organizations [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3738.6200000000003s)]
*  I ran, we were always completely fiscally responsible. Yes or no? Did you lead an audit? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3743.02s)]
*  And the way my leadership has been stated has been completely mischaracterized. Yes or no? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3747.9s)]
*  What are you afraid of? You can't answer this question. Yes or no? Did you lead an audit? [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3751.34s)]
*  Do you not know this answer? Senator, yes or no? Yes or no? Yes or no? Yes or no? Yes or no? [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3755.58s)]
*  Did you lead an audit? I will take that as a no. What were the findings? Though there were no [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3760.54s)]
*  findings, you've never led an audit. What guidance did you give the auditors? None, because you've [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3764.14s)]
*  never led an audit. Nobody expects you to be an accountant, Mr. Hexthath. We expect this for you [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3768.86s)]
*  to understand the complexity of this Pentagon budget process that is absolutely necessary to [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3773.98s)]
*  outfit our war fighters. Look, the Secreta Defense is required to make quick decisions [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3779.58s)]
*  every single day that, well, with high-level information that's being provided for them, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3784.78s)]
*  a Secreta Defense has to have breadth and depth of knowledge. Right now, I am concerned that you [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3789.7400000000002s)]
*  have neither. Mr. Hexthath, what is the highest level of international negotiations that you have [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3794.7000000000003s)]
*  engaged in, that you have led in? Because the Secreta Defense does lead international security [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3800.2200000000003s)]
*  negotiations. There are three main ones that the Secreta Defense leads and signs. Can you name at [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3804.2200000000003s)]
*  least one of them? Could you repeat the question, Senator? Sure. What is the highest level of [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3809.26s)]
*  international security agreement that you have led, and can you name some that the Secreta Defense [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3814.22s)]
*  would lead? There are three main ones. I have not been involved in international security arrangements [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3821.2599999999998s)]
*  because I have not been in government other than serving in the military, so my job has been to [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3826.8599999999997s)]
*  know. So no, the answer is, can you name one of the three main ones that the Secreta Defense signs? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3831.1s)]
*  You're talking about defense arrangements. I mean, NATO might be one of them, one that you're referring to. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3835.18s)]
*  Status of Forces agreement would be one of them. Status of Forces agreement? I've been a part of [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3839.3399999999997s)]
*  teaching about Status of Forces agreements. But you don't remember to mention it? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3844.4599999999996s)]
*  You're not qualified, Mr. Hexthath. You're not qualified. You talk about repairing our defense [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3849.2599999999998s)]
*  industrial complex. You're not qualified to that. You could do acquisition and cross-servicing [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3854.4599999999996s)]
*  agreements, which essentially are security agreements. You can't even mention that. You've [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3858.62s)]
*  done none of those. You talked about the Indo-Pacific a little bit, and I'm glad that you mentioned it. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3862.3799999999997s)]
*  Can you name the importance of at least one of the nations in the ASEAN, [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3866.62s)]
*  in ASEAN, and what type of agreement we have with at least one of those nations? And how many nations [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3872.54s)]
*  are in ASEAN, by the way? I couldn't tell you the exact amount of nations in that. But I know we have [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3877.66s)]
*  allies in South Korea, in Japan, and in AUKUS with Australia, trying to work on submarines with them. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3882.78s)]
*  Mr. Hexthath, none of those countries are in ASEAN. None of those three countries that you've [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3889.58s)]
*  mentioned are in ASEAN. I suggest you do a little homework before you prepare for these types of [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3894.46s)]
*  negotiations. Lifson. Mr. Hexthath, this is... [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3899.7400000000002s)]
*  We ask our troops to go into harm's way all the time. We ask them to go into harm's way. And this [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3907.34s)]
*  behind me is a copy of the Soldier's Creed, a copy that usually hangs over my desk here in the [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3913.98s)]
*  Senate. And you should be familiar with it. It's the same copy that hung over my desk at Walter Reed [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3918.94s)]
*  every single day that I woke up and fought my way back because I wanted to go back and serve [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3923.5s)]
*  next to my buddies who saved my life. The same copy, these words are repeated over and over and [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3928.22s)]
*  over again. And let me read out two things to you, two sentences. I will always place the mission [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3935.02s)]
*  first. And I am disciplined, physically and mentally tough, trained and proficient in my warrior [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3941.58s)]
*  task. Mr. Hexthath, our troops follow these words every single day. And they man up and they pack [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3947.66s)]
*  their rucksacks and they go to war. And they deserve a leader who can lead them, not a leader [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3953.5s)]
*  who wants to lower the standards for himself or raising the standards for other people. And by the [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3958.7s)]
*  way, our troops already meet the standards. We ask troops to man that ship, fight that fire, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3963.98s)]
*  fly that helicopter until their very last breath. And they do that every single day. They cannot be [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3969.58s)]
*  led by someone who's not competent to do the job. How can we ask these warriors to train and perform [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3976.78s)]
*  the absolute highest standards when you are asking us to lower the standards to make you the [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3981.5s)]
*  Secretary of Defense simply because you are buddies with our President-elect? And by the way, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3986.22s)]
*  he has filed for bankruptcy six times. I'm not quite sure he's the kind of CEO you want to refer [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3991.02s)]
*  to as a successful businessman. Let me make it clear. You can't seem to grasp that there is no [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=3995.74s)]
*  U.S. military as we know it without the incredible women that we serve. Women who've earned their [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4002.94s)]
*  place in their units, you have not earned your place as Secretary of Defense. You say you care [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4009.1s)]
*  about keeping our armed forces strong and that you like that armed forces have made meritocracy, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4013.74s)]
*  then let's not lower the standards for you. You, sir, are a no-go at this station. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4019.66s)]
*  Thank you. I'll move on to my next question. America's role in the world. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4023.74s)]
*  Our alliance, is the threats America's facing, they're serious, they're wide-ranging, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4032.38s)]
*  from China to Russia, to Iranian-backed terrorism. So do you agree with the national defense strategy [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4036.3s)]
*  that the U.S. cannot compete with China, Russia, and their partners alone and certainly cannot [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4042.7000000000003s)]
*  win a war that way? And this is a quote from the national defense strategy. Is your interpretation [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4048.78s)]
*  that American first foreign policy is America alone? Does that include abandoning our allies [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4053.34s)]
*  and partners such as NATO, Taiwan, Israel, and others? And if we can't win alone and we don't [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4058.7000000000003s)]
*  strengthen our strategic partnerships, I would say that position, your position, places on a [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4064.86s)]
*  strategic path to lose to our adversaries. So maybe you're okay with choosing that path for America. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4070.54s)]
*  I want to know how you square that position with the positions you articulated in your book where [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4077.26s)]
*  you wrote that NATO is at relic, at best a distraction, and should be scrapped and remade. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4083.1800000000003s)]
*  Are you okay with sending us down a path where we can't win? [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4088.46s)]
*  Senator, the world has had, our friends in the world have had no better ally, our allies and partners [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4092.38s)]
*  have had no better friend than President Donald Trump, who's reinvigorated a NATO alliance, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4098.62s)]
*  who's stood behind Israel in every way, in ways this administration has not. He has [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4103.82s)]
*  ensured that the NATO alliance has become far more robust. He worked with allies in the Pacific as well. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4109.34s)]
*  Is Donald Trump going to stand behind Ukraine? Are you going to stand behind Ukraine? [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4115.98s)]
*  You say he's the strongest president. President-elect Trump said he will end the [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4120.3s)]
*  war in Ukraine before he takes office. Okay, so less than a week before he's inaugurated, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4123.1s)]
*  to the best of your knowledge. Do you have knowledge of a plan that he's going to use to [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4127.66s)]
*  rapidly end the war with Ukraine? Do you believe it's feasible, that it does not make unacceptable [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4132.38s)]
*  concessions to Vladimir Putin, who is a brutal dictator? And are you going to give [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4138.06s)]
*  President-elect Trump the military advice that you have given others to achieve the objective [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4144.22s)]
*  of us winning the war in Ukraine? How do you think a rapid end to the war that Vladimir Putin [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4151.58s)]
*  started will affect the United States standing across the world? Senator, I will always give [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4156.38s)]
*  clear guidance, my clear guidance, best guidance to the President of the United States on matters [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4161.42s)]
*  like that. Do you think that if we concede to Vladimir Putin that that will hurt our credibility [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4165.66s)]
*  with our allies and partners? And do you not believe that our adversaries are watching? [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4170.14s)]
*  You can take that for the record, Mr. Heksef. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Heksef, good to see [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4175.660000000001s)]
*  you here today. Thank you for your service. Thank you, Senator. And your willingness to serve. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4179.9800000000005s)]
*  I also want to thank you for your clarity in articulating the vision you have for the [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4184.3s)]
*  Department of Defense in restoring an ethos, a warrior ethos, which is in stark contrast [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4190.62s)]
*  to the ethos we've seen the last four years, which is of weakness and wokeness. And I want to drill down [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4200.14s)]
*  on a few things specifically and exactly how we've gotten to where we've gotten with recruiting and [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4207.18s)]
*  morale. DEI. There's been a little bit of discussion about this, but for those watching at home, DEI is [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4212.54s)]
*  not about giving everybody opportunity. It is rooted in cultural Marxism. The idea that you [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4219.5s)]
*  pit the room, any room, with oppressor versus oppressed. It's race essentialism, and it is [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4225.74s)]
*  poisoned. It has no business whatsoever in our military. I think the American people have spoken [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4233.58s)]
*  loudly and clearly about this. They're tired of this. They're tired of woke ideology. And to my [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4239.66s)]
*  Democrat colleagues on the other side, if you haven't picked up on that, you missed the plot, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4246.46s)]
*  because that's what November 5th partially was about. And so let's talk specifically about some [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4251.58s)]
*  of these DEI programs that have been funded. In our academy, specifically the Air Force Academy, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4256.0599999999995s)]
*  it was advised as disfavored language to refer to your mom and dad as mom and dad. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4263.42s)]
*  Okay? Dear mom and dad, I'm writing home. Don't say that. That's insane. We're all just people. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4272.78s)]
*  You can't say that either. And in an effort to police this, in a 1984 Orwellian novel, there was [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4280.62s)]
*  actually an eyes and ears program to rat on your fellow students who might say mom and dad, or just [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4289.74s)]
*  say in a tough situation, you know what? We're all just people. Can't say that. This wasn't limited, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4298.22s)]
*  by the way, to our academies. The Secretary of the Air Force, our current Secretary of the Air [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4303.42s)]
*  Force, in a memo from August of 2022 thought we had too many white officers, advocated for quotas. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4313.02s)]
*  And if you crunch the numbers, that meant that 5,800 white officers who worked really hard should [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4321.98s)]
*  be fired. In the United States of America, I don't know how we got here. And by the way, [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4327.82s)]
*  the Air Force isn't alone here. The Navy sort of touted a drag queen influencer. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4335.339999999999s)]
*  This stuff is insane. And people wonder why recruiting has dropped off. And let me just go [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4341.66s)]
*  through a few numbers, and I want to get your comments on how we fixed that. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4346.379999999999s)]
*  Because it's gone completely off the rails. In 2022, the Army missed their recruiting goal [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4349.58s)]
*  of 60,000 soldiers by over 15,000. In 2023, the Navy missed their recruiting goals by over 7,000. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4353.74s)]
*  In 2022, the Air Force couldn't meet their standards, their numbers, even though they [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4362.78s)]
*  lowered their standards. They've lowered their standards to meet numbers they still can't get to. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4368.86s)]
*  They've lowered their standards to meet numbers they still can't get to. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4376.38s)]
*  Mr. Heksef, we got to fix this. I think what you've demonstrated today is that you have the [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4380.7s)]
*  talent and the ability and the desire to fix it. How are you going to fix it? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4387.98s)]
*  Well, Senator, first and foremost, up front, you have to tear out DEI and CRT initiatives, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4393.66s)]
*  root and branch out of institutions. And then you have to put in Army, Navy, [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4400.78s)]
*  and Air Force secretaries and others, civilian positions at the helm who are committed to the [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4406.0599999999995s)]
*  same priorities that the President of the United States is and, if confirmed, the Secretary of [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4411.34s)]
*  Defense will be. Send a clear message that this is not a time for equity. Equity is a very different [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4415.9s)]
*  word than equality. Equality is the bedrock of our military. Men and women, duty positions in uniform, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4422.139999999999s)]
*  black, white, doesn't matter. We treat you equally based on who you are in the image of God as an [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4429.74s)]
*  individual. And we all get the same bad haircuts. You're not an individual. You're part of a group. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4434.46s)]
*  Equity prescribes some sort of an outcome based on differing attributes that we have that divide us. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4441.9s)]
*  What skin color are you? What gender are you? And then infuse that into institutions which [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4448.62s)]
*  manifest in things like quotas, formal or informal, which does what to morale? Sends it in the tubes [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4454.62s)]
*  and it makes people feel like they're being judged by something other than how good they are at their [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4461.34s)]
*  job, which is poisonous inside institutions. So on top of this recruiting crisis, that wasn't enough [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4466.3s)]
*  for this administration. During the COVID hysteria and in their attempt to fire 100,000 people who [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4471.74s)]
*  worked for bigger companies because they didn't get the COVID shot or to mask five-year-olds, [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4481.1s)]
*  they decided also to make this a central plank in their policy at the Pentagon. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4485.34s)]
*  8,000 well-trained, so we got a recruiting crisis, 8,000 well-trained men and women were fired, [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4491.820000000001s)]
*  were fired. Will you commit today, Mr. Hexeth, to recruit these folks back, to give them back pay [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4499.5s)]
*  and give them an apology from the United States government for how they were disrespected? [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4508.78s)]
*  Senator, I will commit to this because the Commander in Chief has committed to this, [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4514.3s)]
*  that not only will they be reinstated, they will receive an apology, back pay and rank that they [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4518.7s)]
*  lost because they were forced out due to an experimental vaccine. Thank you, and I'm a [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4525.0199999999995s)]
*  limited time, but I just want to say for all the talk of experience and not coming from the same [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4530.54s)]
*  cocktail parties that Permanent Washington is used to, you are a breath of fresh air. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4538.46s)]
*  And again, if you weren't paying attention to what this election was all about, it was about [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4544.62s)]
*  the disruptors versus the establishment. And the American people have had enough of business as [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4549.42s)]
*  usual for the same people that we line up for these same jobs who give us the same results. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4555.66s)]
*  We need somebody who's going to go in there and fight for innovation, fight for change. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4561.26s)]
*  I think you're that person and I appreciate your willingness to sit here and listen to some of [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4565.42s)]
*  these undignified attacks. It's ridiculous. Thank you. A few nominees come into this room with all [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4570.62s)]
*  the necessary experience to do this job, to be Secretary of Defense. We get that. It's a reflection [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4576.860000000001s)]
*  on just how big of a job this is. What I want to understand is whether or not you bring any of the [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4583.18s)]
*  necessary experience that this job requires. And here's where I'm concerned. Senator Coleman, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4591.34s)]
*  introducing you, and this is a quote, he said, he has struggled and overcome great personal challenges, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4598.46s)]
*  unquote. You walk in here saying that you've had personal and character issues in your past, [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4606.54s)]
*  including heavy drinking, which you wrote about. And you said, and this is a quote from you, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4612.9400000000005s)]
*  that you said, I sit before you as an open book. Yet you haven't actually said what personal [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4619.02s)]
*  challenges it is that you've overcome when you've been asked about them. So I'm going to give you an [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4627.18s)]
*  opportunity here to be as forthright as you say you want to be. So while leading concerned [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4632.860000000001s)]
*  veterans of America, there were very specific cases cited by individuals about your conduct. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4640.14s)]
*  I'm going to go through a few of them, and I just want you to tell me if these are true or false. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4646.06s)]
*  Very simple. On Memorial Day 2014, at a CVA event in Virginia, you needed to be carried out of the [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4653.1s)]
*  event for being intoxicated. Senator Anamay, smears. Just true or false. Very simple. Summer [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4660.38s)]
*  2014 in Cleveland, drunk in public with the CVA team. Anonymous smears. I'm just asking for true [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4669.74s)]
*  or false questions. True or false answers. An event in North Carolina, drunk in front of three [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4678.62s)]
*  young female staff members after you had instituted a no alcohol policy and then reversed it. True or [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4684.38s)]
*  false. Anonymous smears. December of 2014 at the CVA Christmas party at the Grand Hyatt at Washington, [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4691.0199999999995s)]
*  DC, you were noticeably intoxicated and had to be carried up to your room. Is that true or false? [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4698.06s)]
*  Anonymous smears. Another time a CVA staffer stated that you passed out in the back of a party bus. Is [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4706.14s)]
*  that true or false? Anonymous smears. In 2014, while in Louisiana on official business for CVA, [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4713.5s)]
*  did you take your staff, including young female staff members, to a strip club? Absolutely not. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4722.14s)]
*  Anonymous smears. So is it accurate that the organization reached a financial settlement [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4730.22s)]
*  with a female staffer who claimed to be at a strip club with you and there was a colleague [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4743.26s)]
*  who attempted to sexually assault her? Was there a financial settlement? [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4751.1s)]
*  Senator, I was not involved in that. I don't know the nature of how that played out. But you [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4757.740000000001s)]
*  understand there was a financial settlement for a young female staffer who accused other member of [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4763.900000000001s)]
*  the organization, not you, of sexual assault in a strip club? We have multiple statements on the [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4771.5s)]
*  record referring to that. But you claim you were not there when that occurred? Absolutely not. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4778.46s)]
*  Now, the behavior I cited, if true, do you think that this behavior of intoxication, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4787.26s)]
*  going into these type of establishments, women on your staff being so uncomfortable that they [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4795.9s)]
*  have to file these sort of harassment claims, do you think this is appropriate behavior for a leader? [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4801.34s)]
*  Senator, the overwhelming majority of anyone who's worked for me, including the on-the-record [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4809.34s)]
*  statements that have been submitted to this, with their name on it, on the record, men and women who [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4815.42s)]
*  worked with me every day are the overwhelming preponderance of evidence that testify to my [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4819.74s)]
*  leadership and professionalism in leading Vets for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for America. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4825.9800000000005s)]
*  My leadership has been completely impugned on these veterans' organizations that did fantastic work. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4831.18s)]
*  Mr. Hegseth, I'm not even going to go into the accusations. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4837.58s)]
*  We manage our financial books with integrity across the board. How many people, everybody who runs a campaign... [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4841.9s)]
*  I have limited time. I'm not going to get into the accusations that come from Fox News. Some of your [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4846.94s)]
*  Fox News colleagues here, there are multiple instances of accusations against you about [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4852.3s)]
*  drinking on the job, coming in... All anonymous, all false, all refuted by my colleagues, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4858.38s)]
*  who I worked with for 10 years at 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. and everything... The challenge here for me, Mr. Hegseth, [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4863.1s)]
*  is when there is discussion about personal challenges and you, admittedly, had issues with [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4870.14s)]
*  heavy drinking. It's hard to kind of square this, to square the circle here. It's kind of a difficult [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4878.38s)]
*  thing to do. Let me ask you, I have about 90 seconds left here, if you had to answer these [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4885.34s)]
*  questions about sexual assault against you and your drinking and your personal conduct, would it [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4893.900000000001s)]
*  have been different if you were under oath? Senator, all I'm pointing out is the false claims against me. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4898.46s)]
*  Okay, I do not want to answer that question. I walked into this hearing this morning [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4907.42s)]
*  concerned that you haven't demonstrated adequate leadership in your civilian roles, [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4912.54s)]
*  and this is a dangerous world we're living in here, and America cannot afford a Secretary of [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4919.26s)]
*  Defense who is unprepared for that mission. I'm going to leave with concerns about your transparency. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4924.78s)]
*  You say you've had personal issues in your past, yet when asked about those very issues, you blame [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4930.94s)]
*  an anonymous smear campaign, even when many of these claims are not anonymous. Which is it? [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4937.18s)]
*  Have you overcome personal issues, or are you the target of a smear campaign? It can't be both. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4944.3s)]
*  It's clear to me that you're not being honest with us or the American people, because you know the [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4951.58s)]
*  truth would disqualify you from getting the job, and just as concerning as each of these specific [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4957.34s)]
*  disqualifying accusations are, what concerns me just as much is the idea of having a Secretary [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4963.820000000001s)]
*  of Defense who is not transparent. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Austin testified before the [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4972.46s)]
*  House Armed Services Committee a couple of years ago, and responding to a question from me said he [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4978.62s)]
*  had, quote, no regrets about what happened in Afghanistan. I wonder what do you make of that? [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4984.38s)]
*  Painful. They still tout it as the most successful airlift in American history, [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4990.9400000000005s)]
*  when what the rest of us all saw was true laid before our eyes. Utter failure, a destruction [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=4998.62s)]
*  of a military legacy there, abandonment of our allies, death of American troops, detriment to [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5005.820000000001s)]
*  our reputation, and then no answers and no accountability on the other side, and then [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5013.18s)]
*  what was unleashed because of what happened in Afghanistan? The October 7th attacks, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5017.74s)]
*  an invasion into Ukraine. The world recognized weakness for what it was, and who bore the brunt [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5023.82s)]
*  for it? The troops on the front lines at Abbey Gate doing an impossible job whose external security [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5029.66s)]
*  was the Taliban, because there was no actual plan for this under the Biden administration, and yet [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5033.98s)]
*  not a single person, the only person held accountable in those moments was a Marine Corps [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5040.78s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel who had the courage to stand up and say someone should be held accountable for [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5044.94s)]
*  that. His name is Stu Scheller. No one else involved has ever taken accountability for it. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5048.86s)]
*  When that microcosm becomes the reality of the perception of the American military or America's [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5054.54s)]
*  commitment to victory and success and positive outcomes, the world responds to that. President [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5061.259999999999s)]
*  Trump is going to restore real deterrence by bringing a real warrior culture back, [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5067.099999999999s)]
*  rebuilding our military, and ending wars properly. And if we have to fight them, [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5072.38s)]
*  winning them decisively. I served in Afghanistan, you served in Afghanistan. 75 percent of our [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5076.7s)]
*  nation's veterans disagree with how the withdrawal from Afghanistan was handled, [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5083.58s)]
*  the embarrassment of it, what that's done, I believe, has directly impacted our historic [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5089.66s)]
*  recruitment crisis in this country without a doubt. And you've already talked about that, [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5096.38s)]
*  how do we fix it? How do we bring pride back to wearing the uniform for the next generation to [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5101.5s)]
*  inspire them to do what you and I did to raise our right hand and take that oath [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5107.66s)]
*  and serve this great country? I'll lose back to strong, clear leadership, patriotic, [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5111.82s)]
*  pro-American leadership that says we're not going to focus on all the other political [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5119.179999999999s)]
*  prerogatives. That's why we all have political perspectives. I said this before and I'll say it [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5124.78s)]
*  again. In uniform, none of that matters. You wear green, you wear blue, you bleed red, that's it. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5129.9s)]
*  Who you vote for doesn't matter. But when the perception of that changes, then you don't want [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5135.74s)]
*  people deciding whether to serve based on a political party and power. That's a dangerous [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5141.0199999999995s)]
*  thing for continuity inside your military, and it's fragile right now. President Trump, [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5144.86s)]
*  and if I'm confirmed with my leadership, we're going to restore the continuity of an [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5150.46s)]
*  apolitical military that acts decisively and only based on merit. They sound basic, [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5154.3s)]
*  but they're fundamental. You and I agree that wokeness is weakness. Mr. Hexette, [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5160.7s)]
*  do you support racial quotas in recruitment or promotions in the United States military? [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5166.62s)]
*  Senator, I support any form of racial quota. Do you support affirmative action in our nation's [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5172.14s)]
*  military academies? Senator, I'm hiring and promoting and admitting the best and [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5178.22s)]
*  brightest, whatever their background is. I think that's very important. Mr. Hexette, [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5183.66s)]
*  Lloyd Austin, the secretary, later went AWOL. He disappeared for days and never told the president, [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5188.46s)]
*  didn't even inform the president's chief of staff that he was going into the hospital. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5193.58s)]
*  Would that ever occur on your watch? No, Senator. I know in any one of my jobs, [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5198.46s)]
*  if I had decided to go AWOL for even a day or two in uniform or around that, [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5204.86s)]
*  that would have been a concern. For those who I haven't met in my one week that I've been [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5210.0599999999995s)]
*  sworn into the Senate, I'm a CIA officer recruited after 9-11. I did three tours armed in Iraq [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5213.98s)]
*  alongside the military and have worked for four different secretaries of defense, both Democrat [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5220.0599999999995s)]
*  and Republican proudly, and watched them make decisions that literally determine the life and [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5227.66s)]
*  death of Americans in the dark of night. I'm also a Democrat representing a state that Trump won. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5232.62s)]
*  We both won on the same ballot. So I understand that President Trump has the right to nominate [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5239.0199999999995s)]
*  his people. We are going to have policies that we disagree with. All of that, to me, comes very [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5244.7s)]
*  standard. What I think I'm most concerned with is that no president has the right to use the uniform [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5249.82s)]
*  military in a way that violates the U.S. Constitution and further taints the military as that [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5257.1s)]
*  apolitical institution that we all want. Our founders designed the system so that we had [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5262.860000000001s)]
*  posse commentatus, that we weren't going to use active duty military inside the United States and [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5270.860000000001s)]
*  make American citizens potentially scared of their own military. We went through our own experience [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5276.860000000001s)]
*  with that with the British. As the secretary of defense, you will be the one man standing in the [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5281.74s)]
*  breach should President Trump give an illegal order, right? I'm not saying he will, but if he does, [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5287.9s)]
*  you are going to be the guy that he calls to implement this order. Do you agree that there [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5294.0599999999995s)]
*  are some orders that can be given by the commander in chief that would violate the U.S. Constitution? [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5300.139999999999s)]
*  Senator, thank you for your service. But I reject the premise that President Trump is going to be [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5305.42s)]
*  giving illegal orders. No, I'm not saying he will, but if do you believe there is such a thing as an [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5311.9800000000005s)]
*  illegal order that Joe Biden or any other president Donald Trump could give? Is there anything that a [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5316.14s)]
*  commander in chief could ask you to do with the uniform military that would be in violation of [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5321.66s)]
*  the U.S. Constitution? Senator, anybody of any party could give an order that is against the [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5326.38s)]
*  Constitution or against the law. Right. Okay. So and are you so are you saying that you would stand [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5332.62s)]
*  in the breach and push back if you were given an illegal order? I start by saying I reject the premise [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5337.58s)]
*  that President Trump will be giving any illegal orders at all. But Mike, this isn't a hypothetical. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5342.78s)]
*  Your predecessor in a Trump administration, Secretary Esper, was asked and did use uniform [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5349.42s)]
*  military to clear unarmed protesters. He was given the order to potentially shoot at them. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5355.5s)]
*  Hilos flew low in Washington, D.C. as crowd control. He later apologized publicly for those [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5361.26s)]
*  actions. Was he right or wrong to apologize? Senator, I was there on the ground. I saw that. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5367.9800000000005s)]
*  I understand. And I respect that. I've been there. I understand the level of threat that was involved [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5373.66s)]
*  in that moment. I also understand. So he was. Legality and the Constitution. Sir, was he right [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5379.42s)]
*  or wrong to apologize? I'm not going to put words in the mouth of Secretary Esper or anybody else. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5384.62s)]
*  He said it himself. You don't have to. What are you scared of? Did he do the right thing by [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5390.54s)]
*  apologizing? I'm not scared of anything, Senator. Say yes or no. You can say no. The laws and the [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5395.5s)]
*  Constitution. Okay. So Donald Trump asked for the active duty 82nd Airborne to be deployed during [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5401.0199999999995s)]
*  that same time. Secretary Esper has written that he convinced him against that decision. If Trump [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5407.98s)]
*  asked you to use the 82nd Airborne in law enforcement roles in Washington, D.C., would you [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5414.3s)]
*  also convince him otherwise? I'm not going to get ahead of conversations I would have with the [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5419.900000000001s)]
*  president. However, there are laws and processes inside our Constitution that would be foul. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5424.7s)]
*  Follow President Trump said in November that he is willing to consider using the active duty military [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5429.66s)]
*  against the quote enemy within. Have you been personally involved in discussions of using the [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5435.58s)]
*  U.S. military active duty inside the United States? Senator, I'm fine. I'm glad we finally [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5441.18s)]
*  got to the topic of border security equaling national security because it's been abdicated [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5447.42s)]
*  and ignored for the last four years. That wasn't my question. I'm just asking, have you been involved? [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5452.3s)]
*  You're about to be the secretary of defense potentially. Have you been involved in discussions [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5456.46s)]
*  about using the active duty military inside the United States? Senator, I am not yet the [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5461.18s)]
*  secretary of defense. It's confirmed I would be party to any number of conversations. But you haven't been in any of these conversations. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5467.58s)]
*  Which I would not reveal what I have discussed with the president. No, no, just have you been in [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5472.3s)]
*  conversations? Again, you're going to be in charge of three million people. The active duty that I [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5477.58s)]
*  know you care about, I believe you care about. So have you been in conversations about using the [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5482.0599999999995s)]
*  active duty in any way? Whether it's setting up in detention camps, policing dangerous cities, [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5487.5s)]
*  have you been involved in any of those conversations? Certainly I have been involved in conversations [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5493.5s)]
*  relating to doing things this administration has not, which is secure the southern border [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5499.18s)]
*  and not allow floods of illegals to enter our country through an invasion that threatens the [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5505.18s)]
*  American people. And there are ways in which the military is already playing a role in that to include [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5510.7s)]
*  5,000 national guardsmen from Indiana and Texas. We're at the border right now allowing for border security. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5515.82s)]
*  Will you ask the active duty military to staff detention centers? Our U.S. military is not trained in law enforcement roles. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5520.7s)]
*  I think you know that, right? We've seen how that mission is difficult for them in places like Iraq [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5529.179999999999s)]
*  and Afghanistan because that's not the training a uniformed military comes with. Do you support the [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5534.38s)]
*  use of active duty military in supporting detention camps? Senator, everything we will do would be [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5539.26s)]
*  lawful and under the constitution, but I recognize that this administration has advocated its [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5544.78s)]
*  responsibility. President Trump is going to restore order at the border, prevent our enemies from invading, and yes, he has said mass deportations will be a part of what happens. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5549.66s)]
*  Sir, I get your filibustering. I get it. I get it. In the spirit of preserving the institution that I think we both care about, legitimately, [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5556.22s)]
*  the Uniform Code of Military Justice, I've heard a couple of different things. One, you said you will not [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5563.26s)]
*  change the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which is what governs justice system in the military. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5568.54s)]
*  Yes or no? You said that earlier. Those are laws, Senator, set by Congress. Okay, so you will not go [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5573.82s)]
*  to change it. You will not attempt to change it. You also said that JAG officers are potentially people who [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5579.82s)]
*  put their own interests in their own medals and promotions ahead of the troops. Senator Lindsey Graham [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5585.66s)]
*  was a JAG officer for most of his life. Is that what you believe about those who implement our justice system in the U.S. military? [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5592.0599999999995s)]
*  Senator, I was speaking about particular JAG officers I've had to deal with in my military. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5599.26s)]
*  Are you going to get involved? Not about a member of the United States Senate. Are you as Secretary of Defense going to get involved [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5603.98s)]
*  in the implementation of the U.S. Military Code of Justice? Senator, ultimately, it will be a big part of my job to evaluate decisions [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5609.18s)]
*  vis-Ã -vis the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Have you seen the... Fairly. Is C.Q. Brown on your list [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5616.62s)]
*  in the warrior boards to be removed from his position? Senator, every single senior officer will be [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5623.66s)]
*  reviewed based on meritocracy, standards, lethality, and commitment to lawful orders they will be given. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-WFCZNVUEM&t=5630.06s)]
