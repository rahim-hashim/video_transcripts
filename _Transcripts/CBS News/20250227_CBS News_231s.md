# Why Starmer is visiting Trump after Macron's stop at the White House
**CBS News:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o)
*  Soon, President Trump will host his second foreign leader of the week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=0.0s)]
*  Today, it's UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=4.28s)]
*  It will be their first face-to-face meeting since Trump's return to office. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=6.96s)]
*  The topic on the table? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=11.52s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=13.0s)]
*  Ahead of today's meeting, Starmer attended a welcome reception last night, and he had [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=14.0s)]
*  this to say about the UK's relationship with the United States. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=17.84s)]
*  There is no more important relationship for the United Kingdom in defense, in security, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=23.0s)]
*  in trade, in tech, in finance, and so much more. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=29.32s)]
*  We have an incredible $1.5 trillion invested in each other's economies. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=33.0s)]
*  Our trading relationship is not just strong, it's fair and balanced. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=39.04s)]
*  We work together to create amazing things like the internet or the jet engine. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=44.8s)]
*  But most of all, and this is really the bedrock of that relationship, we share fundamental [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=50.68s)]
*  of openness, of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom to thrive, and freedom to pursue the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=58.28s)]
*  future. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=65.6s)]
*  A freedom which, this week, we've shown our willingness to defend with the biggest sustained [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=66.6s)]
*  increase in our defense spending since the Cold War. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=74.28s)]
*  Okay, let's go to CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinergrath. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=78.08s)]
*  Sam, thank you so much for joining us today. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  What are you watching for today? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=85.56s)]
*  What I'm watching for is whether Prime Minister Starmer can in some way convince President [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  Trump to make a commitment for the United States to provide security guarantees to Ukraine. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=95.2s)]
*  Prime Minister Starmer made several announcements this week to try to sweeten the deal for President [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=101.48s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=106.56s)]
*  Prime Minister Starmer indicated publicly that the United Kingdom will increase its [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=107.56s)]
*  defense spending to 2.5% by 2027, that's three years early, and it will continue to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=112.36s)]
*  increase that defense spending over the coming years. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=117.88s)]
*  In addition to that, Starmer indicated that to finance that increase in defense spending, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=120.6s)]
*  the UK would cut foreign assistance, which is really commensurate with what the United [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=125.48s)]
*  States, President Trump is doing when it comes to U.S. foreign assistance and USAID. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=130.04s)]
*  What Prime Minister Starmer has been unable to do, as has President McCaul also been unable, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=135.04s)]
*  is to convince the United States to make some kind of security commitment to Ukraine's [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=140.24s)]
*  future. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=145.84s)]
*  Even if the UK, France and other European countries put boots on the ground to guarantee [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=146.84s)]
*  Ukraine's future and to deter Russia from further aggression, the United States has [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=151.0s)]
*  so far refused to make such a commitment under Trump. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  And that's part of my next question for you, Sam, here, because we know the UK Prime Minister [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=160.36s)]
*  is expected to push the United States on security guarantees for the country, saying [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=165.24s)]
*  a peace agreement would not be viable without it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=169.96s)]
*  But do you think he'll be able to sway the president on this issue? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=173.24s)]
*  Well, he's certainly saying all the things that are music to President Trump's ears. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=176.88s)]
*  In addition to the increase in UK defense spending, I don't think it's an accident [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=182.08s)]
*  that in his remarks last night, Prime Minister Starmer focused heavily on the investments [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=186.28s)]
*  the UK has in the United States, as well as the, quote, fair and balanced trade relationship [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=191.56s)]
*  between the UK and US. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=196.72s)]
*  Trade imbalances are something that are top of mind for President Trump. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=198.96s)]
*  In addition to that, I do think Prime Minister Starmer will likely ask President Trump, not [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=202.74s)]
*  necessarily for American troops, but potentially for other kinds of security support that are [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=208.56s)]
*  less visible, like logistics coordination, communication support, perhaps intelligence [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=214.16s)]
*  So something less visible than American troops is probably what Prime Minister Starmer is [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=220.32000000000002s)]
*  going to go for. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=224.60000000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=225.84s)]
*  CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, thank you so much for your time [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=226.84s)]
*  today. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzjdd6jaw1o&t=230.96s)]
