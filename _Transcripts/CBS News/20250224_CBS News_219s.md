# Latest news on Pope Francis' health after lung infection, kidney failure
**CBS News:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM)
*  All right, let's start with this in Rome for you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=0.0s)]
*  Pope Francis remains in the hospital, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  resting at this hour after experiencing [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=5.28s)]
*  serious respiratory crisis over the weekend. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=8.08s)]
*  Doctors are monitoring his diagnosis of mild kidney failure, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=11.24s)]
*  but he's very delicate. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=15.06s)]
*  This marks the pontiff's longest stay in hospital [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=16.7s)]
*  since he became the pope. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=19.22s)]
*  CBS News PayPal contributor Delia Gallagher [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=21.04s)]
*  is live now just outside Vatican City [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=23.72s)]
*  with more on the pope's condition. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=26.0s)]
*  What is the latest on how he's doing [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=28.32s)]
*  and what the expectation is for a full recovery? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=31.12s)]
*  Well, Errol, the Vatican tells us this morning [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=37.56s)]
*  that Pope Francis had a restful night. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=39.36s)]
*  Not a whole lot of information in their morning bulletins, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=41.8s)]
*  let's remember, but it's important information [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=44.3s)]
*  given the difficulties that you mentioned [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=46.9s)]
*  that the pope experienced this weekend, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  a respiratory crisis, a bit of anemia, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=50.44s)]
*  which required blood transfusions, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  and of course the initial beginnings [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=55.44s)]
*  of a mild renal insufficiency. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=57.08s)]
*  All of those, by the way, Errol, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=59.6s)]
*  the Vatican clarified on Sunday, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=61.16s)]
*  have been put under control now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  We know that the pope is in good spirits. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  He was able to participate in mass yesterday [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=68.44s)]
*  on the 10th floor of the Jamele Hospital [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=70.84s)]
*  where he's staying with some nurses [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=73.16s)]
*  and healthcare workers there. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=74.78s)]
*  And we know that he was able also to thank people [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=76.98s)]
*  for all of their well wishes, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=80.64s)]
*  and we're sending out a tweet yesterday [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=82.04s)]
*  to express his thanks for the well wishes [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=84.2s)]
*  that have come in from around the world. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=86.68s)]
*  Errol? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=88.56s)]
*  And all of this is so crucial because the pope had said [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=89.4s)]
*  if he felt that he could not conduct his duties, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=92.0s)]
*  he would step down. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=95.0s)]
*  But what do we know about the care he's receiving? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=96.56s)]
*  It's likely the best the world has to offer, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  but what specifically is being done to get him on the mend? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=102.2s)]
*  Well, absolutely, look, his primary doctor [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=107.98s)]
*  is Dr. Sergio Alfieri. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=110.36s)]
*  He's the man who operated on the pope in 2023 [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=112.68s)]
*  for his intestinal difficulties. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=114.8s)]
*  He gave a press conference on Friday [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=116.4s)]
*  and explained exactly what the difficult balance is [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=118.36s)]
*  in trying with an 88 year old patient [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=121.44s)]
*  to find the right amount of drugs [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=123.5s)]
*  that aren't going to kick out one thing [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=126.02000000000001s)]
*  and cause another problem, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=127.86s)]
*  such as we saw a little bit this weekend with the anemia [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=129.04s)]
*  and with the respiratory difficulties and so on. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  Now he did not specify the types of drugs [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=135.16s)]
*  that he is giving the pope, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=137.6s)]
*  but he did say they are a lot. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=138.52s)]
*  And on Friday, therefore, he said, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=140.6s)]
*  minimum a week stay in the hospital. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=142.68s)]
*  But of course, that was before the difficulties [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=144.84s)]
*  now this weekend in which the hospital is saying [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=146.8s)]
*  prognosis is reserved. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=150.44s)]
*  So they won't be saying exactly when the pope [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=151.8s)]
*  will be able to come home. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=153.84s)]
*  And Delia, it's such an important time. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=155.46s)]
*  You've got so many Catholics coming to Rome [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=157.02s)]
*  to get to the Vatican, usually during this jubilee time, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=159.22s)]
*  to see the pope. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=162.0s)]
*  They are still coming, but he's not there, of course. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=163.56s)]
*  So how is the Vatican managing operations in his absence? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=166.44s)]
*  Well, look, the Vatican is no stranger to popes in hospital. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=171.44s)]
*  This has happened many times throughout various pontificates. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=175.4s)]
*  So the whole place keeps running. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=178.32s)]
*  In fact, all of the jubilee events [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=179.8s)]
*  are still on schedule and so forth. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=181.4s)]
*  And the offices keep running. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=183.72s)]
*  In fact, last week, they told us [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=185.72s)]
*  that some of the pope's closest collaborators [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=187.28s)]
*  were bringing the pope documents and so forth to discuss. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  So the Vatican keeps going as it were, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=192.88s)]
*  and certainly for all of the pilgrims that are coming, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=194.84s)]
*  all of the events are still happening. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=197.32s)]
*  In fact, just behind me, they're setting up tonight [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=199.84s)]
*  for a special rosary. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  All of the cardinals in Rome are going to come [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=203.76s)]
*  to St. Peter's Square with all of the pilgrims here [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=206.6s)]
*  to say a special prayer tonight at nine o'clock [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  for the pope. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=211.64s)]
*  Errol? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=213.0s)]
*  All right, we hope he gets on the mend soon. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=213.84s)]
*  Delia, thanks so much for the latest information. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=215.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iKBvPVNsM&t=217.96s)]
