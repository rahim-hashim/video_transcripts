# Helicopter crew in D.C. midair plane crash possibly had "bad data," officials say
**CBS News:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU)
*  The National Transportation Safety Board gave an important update to the public today on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=0.0s)]
*  its investigation into the deadly midair collision between an Army Blackhawk helicopter and a [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  regional American Airlines passenger jet. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=9.92s)]
*  That crash killed 67 people. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  Among the NTSB's findings, the Blackhawk pilot possibly had, quote, bad data. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=15.6s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News senior transportation correspondent Chris Van Cleave. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Chris, catch us up on what we learned. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=24.72s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=27.36s)]
*  Now, obviously the investigation is early, so some things may change here, Major, but [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=27.86s)]
*  what has stood out to investigators, in particular with the helicopter, they pointed to a moment [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=32.48s)]
*  about five minutes before the collision, where one of the pilots reported being at 300 feet, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=37.36s)]
*  the other said they were at 400 feet, and they noted there was no discussion between [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=43.28s)]
*  the pilots about that altitude disagreement. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  They want to understand what information the helicopter may have been feeding to those [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=51.22s)]
*  pilots. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=56.0s)]
*  Is it possible the helicopter was giving them bad data about their altitude? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=57.0s)]
*  There's some data in the flight recorder that they determined was just not useful, not accurate. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=60.92s)]
*  So they're trying to understand if those pilots even knew what altitude they were really flying [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=67.24s)]
*  at. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=71.52s)]
*  The other thing, and this is significant, it appears two key air traffic control messages [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=72.52s)]
*  may have not ever reached the Blackhawk helicopter. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=78.84s)]
*  In one point where the controller is telling the helicopter that the regional jet was circling [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=82.38000000000001s)]
*  around to a different runway, it appears part of that message, the circling around part, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=87.8s)]
*  didn't get to the helicopter. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=93.82000000000001s)]
*  It's not recorded on their black box. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=95.62s)]
*  It's heard in the airplane, not in the helicopter. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=97.54s)]
*  And then 17 seconds before disaster, air traffic control told the helicopter to pass behind [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=100.86s)]
*  the jet, well, it appears one of the pilots keyed the radio during that call, eight seconds [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=108.42s)]
*  of it, including the portion where they said circle around, was lost to the pilots, they think. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=113.86s)]
*  So this could be, and again, to your very top point, lots more to learn, lots more to explain. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=119.74000000000001s)]
*  But this could be either data that is in some way garbled or basic fundamental communications [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=127.02000000000001s)]
*  that don't make it where they need to land. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=133.28s)]
*  I think they're looking at both of those things that may end up being factors here. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=136.01999999999998s)]
*  If the helicopter pilots are given bad data and don't know what altitude they're flying at, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=139.7s)]
*  they may have thought they were in the exact right place where they were supposed to be. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=144.85999999999999s)]
*  It's also interesting that you had one pilot note they were at 300, the other said 400 [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=149.38s)]
*  on a checkride where one pilot is evaluating the other and there was no conversation about [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=154.62s)]
*  the apparent altitude disagree. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=159.82s)]
*  If each of their screens are showing different altitudes, that's significant too and that's [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=161.98s)]
*  significant in pilot communication. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=166.42s)]
*  And then there's this issue with did the message from controllers get to the helicopter pilots, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=168.38s)]
*  did they have the necessary information they needed? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=173.85999999999999s)]
*  We understand now from investigators it looks increasingly likely that the pilots of the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=176.57999999999998s)]
*  airliner major made a last second effort to take an evasive maneuver to avoid a collision, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=181.1s)]
*  but there is no conversation, no indication at all on board the Blackhawk recorder that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=186.85999999999999s)]
*  those pilots ever saw the plane they flew right into. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=191.54s)]
*  Bringing so much of this to light, thank you very much Chris Van Cleave, I appreciate it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=195.22s)]
*  Sure thing. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtXZSPmqGqU&t=198.73999999999998s)]
