# New crisis holding up Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal final approvals, Netanyahu says
**CBS News:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA)
*  As Palestinians around the world celebrate the announcement of a ceasefire and hostage deal, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA&t=0.0s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warns of a last-minute holdup. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA&t=7.0s)]
*  Netanyahu says Hamas is backpedaling on parts of that agreement. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA&t=12.0s)]
*  He says the Israeli cabinet won't okay the deal until Hamas backs down. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA&t=16.0s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Rami Inosensio brings us the very latest from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA&t=22.0s)]
*  This news will be disheartening and frustrating for many here in Israel and in Gaza. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA&t=28.0s)]
*  We first got word this morning that the cabinet meeting was delayed but didn't see any reason at the time. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA&t=33.0s)]
*  Then the Prime Minister's office issued a statement that Hamas reneged on parts of the deal [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA&t=38.0s)]
*  and claimed it was, quote, in its own words, to extort last-minute concessions. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA&t=43.0s)]
*  Israeli media report this has to do with which Palestinian detainees that Israel would release [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA&t=48.0s)]
*  in exchange for those Israeli hostages. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA&t=54.0s)]
*  In the initial agreement, both sides agreed that certain detainees would not be released. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA&t=56.0s)]
*  Now the Prime Minister's office reportedly says that Hamas wants to have a final say on who they get, basically a veto. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA&t=61.0s)]
*  And this could mean that they want higher value prisoners, detainees, and who could be potential leaders of Hamas. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA&t=68.0s)]
*  Talks do continue, though. Hamas has said it is committed to the deal. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA&t=76.0s)]
*  But until that deal is signed, the IDF has continued to bomb Gaza. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA&t=80.0s)]
*  Overnight there was an airstrike on a house in Gaza City, also on a mosque. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA&t=85.0s)]
*  Our CBS News team in Gaza tells us that at least 77 people have been killed since we broke the news last night of that ceasefire deal. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA&t=89.0s)]
*  At the same time, we also know humanitarian aid trucks are now on the move. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA&t=97.0s)]
*  Some are amassing on Gaza's southern border with Egypt in the border town of El Arish. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA&t=102.0s)]
*  That's about only 30 miles from Rafa or so. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA&t=107.0s)]
*  Preps are being made to try to open that Rafa border crossing that has been closed since May. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA&t=110.0s)]
*  But again, that deal first has to be agreed. Back to you. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4aItUztAA&t=115.0s)]
