# Pentagon layoffs paused for now, official says
**CBS News:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY)
*  Well, the Pentagon tells CBS News massive layoffs, at least for now, are on hold. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=0.0s)]
*  This move comes after thousands of workers were at risk today of losing their jobs. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Imagine that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=10.28s)]
*  You wake up, you think, by 5 o'clock, will I have a job? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=11.28s)]
*  So let's get right to CBS News senior national correspondent, security correspondent Charlie [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=13.64s)]
*  Daggett. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=17.0s)]
*  Charlie, what happened here? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=18.0s)]
*  Why the sudden reversal? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=19.0s)]
*  You know, you just nailed it right there because individuals that I've been speaking to for [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=20.48s)]
*  a number of days actually say, look, we wake up in the morning, we check our emails to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=27.36s)]
*  see if we still get a job. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=30.16s)]
*  So the way it was explained to me today, as I said, officials had told us to expect that [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  there was going to be these cutbacks of civilian workforce, 50,000 of them. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=35.72s)]
*  It's been put on hold for a couple of reasons. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=41.24s)]
*  As it was explained to me here today, this is not the kind of organization that turns [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  on a dime. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=47.68s)]
*  We have 800,000 civilian employees, and it's across the workforce. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=48.68s)]
*  So they're looking into, first of all, the legalities of making these cuts and then also [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=53.36s)]
*  what kind of imposition they have on essentially the running of the DOD and the military. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=57.94s)]
*  So they have to look at what's been called mission-critical employees. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=63.56s)]
*  And Defense Secretary Hegsad said, this is really, I'm quoting him here, re-evaluation [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=68.56s)]
*  of probationary employees, personnel that are not mission-critical. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=73.46000000000001s)]
*  They'll be looking at poor performance. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=76.92s)]
*  There's a hiring freeze. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=79.36s)]
*  So what we were focusing on were probationary individuals, people that have been on probation, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=81.28s)]
*  either new hires or switching jobs. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=86.88s)]
*  And they're usually on probation for about a year. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=89.4s)]
*  Sometimes it's a little bit more than that. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=91.84s)]
*  But they're looking at that area to make the easiest cuts. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=93.7s)]
*  But as I said, it's been pushed back upstairs for them to re-evaluate the type of individuals [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=97.06s)]
*  and the number of individuals and the legalities of firing this many people. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=102.78s)]
*  Well, a pause at the Pentagon. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=107.36s)]
*  Thank you so much for that, Charlie Daggett. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=109.54s)]
*  And we know you'll be watching it in the days and weeks ahead. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=111.26s)]
*  Have a good day. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDAvXvEQmY&t=113.1s)]
