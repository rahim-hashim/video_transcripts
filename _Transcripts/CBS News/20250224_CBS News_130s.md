# Texas officials investigate potential measles exposure at two state universities
**CBS News:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ)
*  Two Texas universities have issued warnings about potential exposure to measles after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=0.0s)]
*  someone who toured both campuses about 10 days ago tested positive. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=5.26s)]
*  The state's health department says there are now more than 90 cases of measles in West [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=9.1s)]
*  Texas, mostly among unvaccinated people. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=13.42s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Omar Villafranca has the latest. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=16.64s)]
*  Omar? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=19.62s)]
*  We are here in Seminole, Texas near the Texas-New Mexico border. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=20.62s)]
*  Gaines County and this hospital sign behind me shows that this is kind of the ground zero [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=25.9s)]
*  for the biggest measles outbreak in 30 years here in Texas. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=30.74s)]
*  As a matter of fact, if I step out of the way, you'll see that impromptu sign that they [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=34.3s)]
*  had to spray paint there. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=37.66s)]
*  It's where they're doing measles testing. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=38.9s)]
*  Now the state says that this started, this outbreak in a small Mennonite community. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=40.54s)]
*  The numbers right now statewide are roughly 90 cases confirmed so far. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=45.86s)]
*  More than 70 are in children 17 years and younger. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=52.14s)]
*  That's who's getting hit on this. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=57.660000000000004s)]
*  Side note that the state says that the Mennonite community, they are not vaccinated against [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=59.42s)]
*  measles and that's why it is hitting that community hard. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=64.94s)]
*  But this is of statewide concern for a few reasons because somebody who tested positive [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=67.7s)]
*  here in Gaines County drove more than 400 miles, drove to San Marcos, Texas, just south [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=72.1s)]
*  of Austin, visited Texas State University's campus and also went and ate at a restaurant [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=77.34s)]
*  on February 14th. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=82.9s)]
*  The next day they were in San Antonio, went to UT San Antonio and also visited the River [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=84.18s)]
*  Walk and some tourist attractions there, highly populated areas. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=90.22s)]
*  So now the state is watching to see if cases don't pop up there. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=95.30000000000001s)]
*  On their way back they also stopped at a Buc-E's and if you ever heard of Buc-E's it's a very [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=99.98s)]
*  very popular convenience store all across the south that started here in Texas. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=105.02s)]
*  That person also went there so they're trying to see if there's any cases that may pop up [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=109.14s)]
*  from there. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=113.53999999999999s)]
*  The state is keeping an eye on this but they're saying the best thing that people can do is [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  check their vaccination records to see if they got the booster and if they are up to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=118.5s)]
*  date. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=123.78s)]
*  But the state says they're going to be watching this to see if they can contain it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=124.78s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=128.1s)]
*  Oh, Marvia Franca, thank you. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsK6gwYRSZQ&t=129.1s)]
