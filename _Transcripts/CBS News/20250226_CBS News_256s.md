# New Trump memo will direct agencies to prepare for more firings, source says
**CBS News:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok)
*  The federal workforce remains on edge as emails from the Department of Government Efficiency [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=0.0s)]
*  continue to create more questions than answers. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  Sources tell CBS News the administration plans to issue a new memo directing agencies to [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=8.68s)]
*  prepare for more large-scale firings. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=14.06s)]
*  And this of course follows demands for federal workers to reply to an existing email detailing [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  their accomplishments. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=22.0s)]
*  President Trump doubled down on Doge's directive yesterday. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=23.88s)]
*  Well it's somewhat voluntary but it's also if you don't answer I guess you get fired. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=27.919999999999998s)]
*  And after struggling to say precisely who is in charge at Doge, the White House now [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=33.16s)]
*  says it's this woman, Amy Gleason. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=38.06s)]
*  CBS News spoke to Gleason yesterday ahead of her announcement as Doge's acting administrator [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=41.0s)]
*  and she said she was in Mexico and declined to comment further. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=47.04s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Natalie Brand joins us live from the White House with more on [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=51.92s)]
*  this. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=55.959999999999994s)]
*  What do we know about this Doge memo or at least the White House memo giving guidance [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=57.0s)]
*  to even more widespread firings and when it might arrive in the folks' Zimboxes? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=62.64s)]
*  Yeah Errol good morning. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=68.92s)]
*  The exact timing a little unclear at this point but CBS News has confirmed that this [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  memo is expected to come from the Office of Budget and Management, an office of personnel [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=74.8s)]
*  management directing agencies to submit reorganization plans preparing for additional mass firings [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=81.0s)]
*  as part of a sweeping reduction in force. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=91.16s)]
*  So hopefully we get more details on this today but this is expected to kind of continue in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=95.16s)]
*  coming weeks and of course Errol this comes on top of the thousands of probationary or [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=101.08s)]
*  newer employee layoffs that we saw across federal government since earlier this month. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=106.98s)]
*  We know that these job cuts are hitting Maryland and Northern Virginia workers hard. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=114.42s)]
*  I'm wondering how the surrounding states there next to DC are trying to help. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=119.58s)]
*  Yeah we're seeing this trend by cities and states trying to step up and provide resources [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=124.98s)]
*  to impacted federal workers and take Virginia for instance. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=131.2s)]
*  It has an estimated 145,000 federal civilian employees. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=135.94s)]
*  This is putting Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin a Trump ally in kind of a tricky position. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=141.06s)]
*  So this week the state launched an initiative called Virginia Has Jobs to try and connect [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=147.14s)]
*  federal employees who have been laid off with new jobs, public local jobs in the state of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=153.74s)]
*  private sector jobs in Virginia through an online database that they can go on and kind [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=161.98s)]
*  of scroll these jobs. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=168.1s)]
*  The state says it has around 250,000 open jobs. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=169.62s)]
*  I spoke to Virginia's employment commissioner Demetrius Melis about this effort. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=174.85999999999999s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=180.89999999999998s)]
*  Certainly when someone loses their job it is an anxiety provoking situation. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=183.01999999999998s)]
*  The important thing that we focus on is then to transition and ensure how do we provide [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=189.02s)]
*  them those services to stabilize their situation and to allow them to return to something new [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=192.76s)]
*  and an opportunity to gain gainful employment. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=199.68s)]
*  And Melis says his office the state is also processing claims for unemployment insurance [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=205.52s)]
*  from impacted federal workers since the start of this month as well as federal contractors [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=211.46s)]
*  who are logging up online or calling his office and asking for next steps. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=218.0s)]
*  He has a call center able to provide these resources. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=224.2s)]
*  We know that there's a similar effort underway in Maryland where there's an estimated 140,000 [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=227.04s)]
*  federal workers, kind of an online resource page that the governor's office has launched [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=233.12s)]
*  there and Errol we're starting to see hiring job fairs in some of these impacted counties [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=238.64s)]
*  and states. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=245.96s)]
*  Virginia for instance planning a big state virtual job fair next week. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=246.96s)]
*  So many people will be in need of those resources. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=252.04s)]
*  Natalie thank you very much. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qx3BBZ6mok&t=254.4s)]
