# Trump speaks at National Prayer Breakfast; judge blocks birthright executive order
**CBS News:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0)
*  I want to bring in CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes, who's at the Washington [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=0.0s)]
*  Hilton where the second prayer breakfast President Trump attended is taking place. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=5.84s)]
*  And Nancy joins us now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=11.02s)]
*  Nancy, no word yet, I guess, if the president intends to replace 2 Corinthians with his [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=13.18s)]
*  favorite Bible passage to Corinthians. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=20.32s)]
*  But tell me what's going on there today at the president's prayer breakfast. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=23.02s)]
*  Well, the president talked a lot about religious freedom and religious liberty, Vlad. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=28.4s)]
*  He said that he wants to be the president to bring religious liberty back and bring [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=33.64s)]
*  it back very strongly. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=39.839999999999996s)]
*  He outlined some steps that he wants to take to do that. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  For example, he said in his speech here at the Washington Hilton that he is going to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  create a new presidential commission on religious liberty. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=51.16s)]
*  He said it's going to be a very big deal. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=54.96s)]
*  He said he's going to be signing an executive order later today directing his new attorney [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=57.32s)]
*  general, Pam Bondi, to create a task force to immediately eradicate all forms of anti-Christian [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=62.16s)]
*  bias in the U.S. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=70.6s)]
*  And then finally, he said he's going to be creating an office of White House faith, White [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=73.28s)]
*  House faith office, rather. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  He insisted that religious freedom has been under attack, under assault over the last [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=80.60000000000001s)]
*  few years. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=87.0s)]
*  He argued that the Biden administration was against religious freedom. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=88.12s)]
*  And he didn't give many examples of that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=93.64s)]
*  He did point to a woman who was here at this prayer breakfast this morning who had been [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=95.28s)]
*  sentenced to two years in prison after she protested outside of a D.C. abortion clinic. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=101.36s)]
*  The president pardoned her recently. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=108.2s)]
*  He said that she was simply exercising her First Amendment rights, her religious liberty. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=110.0s)]
*  Prosecutors said that she and her fellow protesters were physically blocking patients from getting [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=118.72s)]
*  into the office. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=123.8s)]
*  Nevertheless, here before this gathering for the prayer breakfast, President Trump said [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=125.76s)]
*  he wants to put religious freedom front and center in his administration. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=131.44s)]
*  OK, we'll see what happens there, Nancy. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=135.28s)]
*  Let me ask you about this federal judge who's blocked the president's executive order that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=138.64s)]
*  aims at ending birthright citizenship. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=142.83999999999997s)]
*  This was a major campaign promise of the president. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  What is the White House now saying about it? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=148.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, they are likely to appeal this second decision by a federal judge to at least temporarily [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=151.44s)]
*  block the president's new executive order. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=161.44s)]
*  She said that it would be unconstitutional to fulfill this executive order, that no court [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=164.72s)]
*  in 125 years has ever agreed with the analysis of the Trump administration about birthright [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=170.52s)]
*  citizenship. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=178.4s)]
*  What Trump wants to do is basically prevent anyone who is born to someone who is here [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=179.76s)]
*  in the country illegally or here in the country illegally, but temporarily, from being able [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=185.32s)]
*  to claim birthright citizenship. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=191.44s)]
*  For now, though, that's on ice. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=194.67999999999998s)]
*  That is blocked as this case winds through the courts and potentially heads eventually [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=196.48s)]
*  to the Supreme Court. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=200.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=202.2s)]
*  And finally, Nancy, in a post on his true social account this morning, the president [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=203.2s)]
*  says Gaza would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  So this is not an off the cuff remark the president has made. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=214.64s)]
*  This is something that he is signaling, which will be a major policy stance of the United [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=218.16s)]
*  States government. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=223.04s)]
*  So what is the White House's plan for Gaza at this moment? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=224.88s)]
*  I would say it's still quite confusing, Vlad. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  What the president said in that post last night was that somehow the Israelis would [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=232.6s)]
*  hand Gaza over to the United States after the fighting has ended and after Israel has [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=240.0s)]
*  somehow managed to relocate the two million people who live in Gaza right now, put them [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=247.23999999999998s)]
*  somewhere else in beautiful housing, as the president put it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  And so it would basically be handed over to the United States empty. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=256.84s)]
*  And that is why he argues the U.S. would not need to commit any U.S. troops to the operation, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  because there would be no one there to fight the U.S. occupation. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=267.44s)]
*  He has also insisted this wouldn't cost the U.S. any money, even as he says that the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=272.56s)]
*  developing it into a world class destination. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=278.92s)]
*  And he has also said that we would own it in perpetuity. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=283.40000000000003s)]
*  How that would cost no money, require no U.S. troops remains to be seen. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=287.44s)]
*  We have asked the White House about this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=292.36s)]
*  They have sometimes given different explanations than the president himself has. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=294.20000000000005s)]
*  They have said it's only going to be temporary, that people would eventually be allowed to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=298.56s)]
*  come back. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  And as we know, Vlad, the reaction from overseas, from Middle Eastern countries has been that [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=303.88s)]
*  all of this would be against international law to displace millions of Palestinians. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=308.12s)]
*  And Nancy, really quickly, I know you and the White House press corps are very familiar [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=314.28s)]
*  with Trumpese, but and I get that sometimes the president will inject some humor in the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=318.52s)]
*  things that he's saying, but what is the reference to Chuck Schumer, who happens to be a Jewish [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=323.28s)]
*  American with reference to Gazans being resettled? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=326.88s)]
*  I'm failing to understand the connection. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=331.12s)]
*  You're talking about in his true social post last night? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=335.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=338.72s)]
*  Well, it's true that Chuck Schumer is Jewish. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=341.72s)]
*  However, Schumer is also against this idea that somehow the Israelis have full rights [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=345.4s)]
*  to the Gaza Strip and they simply have the power to hand it over to the United States. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=352.36s)]
*  However, Vlad, I can tell you that at the White House and conservatives in this country [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=357.72s)]
*  and conservative leaders in Israel have long believed that the Israelis should lay claim [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=363.56s)]
*  to more territory, either in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=369.92s)]
*  And so what the president is saying, even though it's a bit confusing off the cuff, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=373.56s)]
*  even though it seems a little bit half-baked, it does reflect what some conservatives in [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=378.64000000000004s)]
*  this country and what some right-wing leaders in Israel have been saying for quite some [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=384.0s)]
*  time. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=388.32s)]
*  And that's why it's being received very positively from these right-wing leaders in Israel, even [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=389.32s)]
*  as you hear condemnation from other nations in the Middle East. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=394.2s)]
*  Important context there, as always, from Nancy Cordes. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=399.40000000000003s)]
*  Nancy, thank you, my friend. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=401.52000000000004s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIkMQL7lH0&t=402.88s)]
