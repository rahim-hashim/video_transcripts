# Trump military executive orders anticipated as Hegseth starts at Pentagon
**CBS News:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k)
*  Now it is the first day on the job for newly confirmed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=0.0s)]
*  And before he even walked up into the steps of the Pentagon today, he promised to bring [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=4.9s)]
*  major changes. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=9.68s)]
*  CBS News Senior National Security Correspondent Charlie Dagata is live at the Pentagon. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Charlie, thanks for being here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Can you tell us what changes will be made to DEI policies and what can we expect from [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=17.92s)]
*  an executive order relating to transgender troops? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, Mugo, we were here this morning when Secretary Hegseth, I'm going to have to get [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=27.88s)]
*  used to saying that, walked up the steps of the Pentagon. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=33.12s)]
*  He said he was going to be an agent of change. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=35.48s)]
*  He was actually here over the weekend holding meetings, but sort of officially this is day one. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=38.12s)]
*  So let's start with the order for the transgender troops first. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=42.72s)]
*  So according to a fact sheet that we've seen, it simply bans transgender people from serving [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=46.68s)]
*  in the military. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=51.64s)]
*  We don't have the exact numbers, but an advocacy group that I spoke with this morning put the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=53.16s)]
*  number in the thousands. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=57.919999999999995s)]
*  There have been some estimates around 15,000. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=58.919999999999995s)]
*  I wasn't steered away from that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  But it's difficult because not every transgender service member has self-identified. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=63.4s)]
*  Some had already gone through the transition process before enlisting. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=69.44s)]
*  Others might be somewhere along in the process. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=72.52s)]
*  In fact, in the language of that fact sheet, the President himself explicitly refers to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=74.19999999999999s)]
*  transgender people as trans-identifying, which is contentious enough. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=79.68s)]
*  So the argument, and it's one that's supported by the incoming secretary, is that allowing [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  transgender personnel to serve on the front lines, it undermines military readiness and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  unit cohesion. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=96.36000000000001s)]
*  But it's worth notice. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=97.36000000000001s)]
*  This isn't an immediate blanket ban. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=99.92000000000002s)]
*  This is an executive order. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=101.48s)]
*  The DOD, including Secretary Hegseth, they have to come up with a plan to implement the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=103.2s)]
*  policy. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=107.08000000000001s)]
*  Now as far as DEI is concerned, it gets murky. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  So Secretary Hegseth's mission was made very clear. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=113.48s)]
*  He posted on X over the weekend, DOD, he wrote, does not equal DEI. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  He said no exceptions, no name changes, no delays. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=121.52s)]
*  Those who did not comply will no longer work here. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=125.72s)]
*  Now, again, implementing that policy is going to be more difficult. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=129.04s)]
*  So as I understand it, there's no dedicated DEI department or personnel who work in those [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=132.88s)]
*  programs. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=140.4s)]
*  So it'll take identifying who would be considered working towards DEI or those sort of policies, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=141.4s)]
*  and that might come down to human resources when it comes down to personnel in this building. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=148.0s)]
*  It's going to come down to the individual branches when it comes to their own recruitment [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  and training. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=156.72s)]
*  So in the past few days, they've already been trying to purge mentions of diversity [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=157.72s)]
*  from websites and training. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=161.79999999999998s)]
*  Lots of changes coming on that one, for sure. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=164.39999999999998s)]
*  Trump is expected to reinstate service members who were discharged for not getting vaccinated. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=166.39999999999998s)]
*  What are the details here? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=171.76s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's right. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=176.04s)]
*  Checking with individual services, because that's how we have to get this information, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=178.6s)]
*  we estimate that roughly 8000 service members were discharged for not taking part in the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=182.64s)]
*  COVID vaccine program. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=187.27999999999997s)]
*  So they were removed from the military back in 2021. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=188.52s)]
*  That order was rescinded by the Biden administration. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=193.2s)]
*  Only a few dozen people came back to active duty, genuinely, like 40-something. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=195.8s)]
*  It might be different this time because not only is back pay on offer, but those personnel [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=201.88s)]
*  who were discharged will be returned to their original rank, according to the directive. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=206.04s)]
*  Again, this will all be in the implementation. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=212.36s)]
*  So turning now to the previous administration, when President Joe Biden lifted the ban, not [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=215.24s)]
*  many people came back. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=220.6s)]
*  So do we know if they will give back pay to all 8000 troops, even if they aren't reinstated [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=221.72s)]
*  in the military? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=227.16s)]
*  And how much could that possibly cost? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=228.44s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=231.96s)]
*  You can see how complicated it gets, right? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=233.0s)]
*  And as I said, only 43, roughly 40-something came back of 8000. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=235.0s)]
*  As I understand it, some members were happy to be discharged. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=240.8s)]
*  They didn't want to come back to the military. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=244.72s)]
*  But that incentive is there, right? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  So that back pay is there, and also the return to rank. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=248.16s)]
*  Now, that may be the hook. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=251.36s)]
*  I'm not entirely sure that that back pay is paid if they don't come back. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  And it's also worth mentioning, too, I've been drilling down to it a little bit, the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=257.52s)]
*  way back pay works is it's offset by any income they may have made in their sort of civilian [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=260.64s)]
*  life. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  It really, I hate the phrase, but in this term it applies, it really remains to be seen [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=267.6s)]
*  what that uptake is. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=272.0s)]
*  Because 8000 people, if you were to divide the average salary or multiply it, 40,000 [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=273.36s)]
*  US service members, I don't know, it comes out to roughly $1.2 billion if every single [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=280.48s)]
*  person came in and all of that money was back paid. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  But again, there are so many caveats there. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=290.8s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of money we're talking about there. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=293.44s)]
*  And obviously a lot of unknowns as well. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=295.28s)]
*  But Charlie, thank you so much for your time. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjYOmdK9C2k&t=299.84s)]
