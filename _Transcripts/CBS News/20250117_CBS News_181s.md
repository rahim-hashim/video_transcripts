# California crews making progress on wildfires as residents wait to see what's left of homes
**CBS News:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E)
*  All right, California wild fighters, they've made progress in getting that massive Eton [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=0.0s)]
*  fire to more than 50% contained now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=4.32s)]
*  I'm so thankful to be able to report that. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=7.12s)]
*  Unfortunately though, there's a new threat in the LA area, landslides. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=9.52s)]
*  National Guard checkpoints are now set up to keep people out of evacuation zones where [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=13.68s)]
*  many dangers remain. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=17.52s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Tom Hanson joins us live from Alta Dena, that neighborhood completely [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=19.04s)]
*  devastated. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=23.44s)]
*  Tom, you're in an area that will just be ages before it can be rebuilt. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Folks still trying to see what's left of their properties. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=30.6s)]
*  What have you seen so far? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=34.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know, as these fires are, the containment is growing around these fires, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=36.44s)]
*  many people are still waiting to get back. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=44.36s)]
*  They're anxiously awaiting to get back to see what's left. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=46.36s)]
*  And I just want to give you guys a little bit of a sense of what we're seeing on the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=48.52s)]
*  ground here. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=51.84s)]
*  Block after block of devastation exactly like this. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=54.4s)]
*  We pulled up to what appears to be a home, although it's really impossible to distinguish [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=58.24s)]
*  between homes and businesses and what was standing before these catastrophic fires came [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  into place. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=70.92s)]
*  And so, you know, the people here, you know, they're in a sense of shock, but they are [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=71.92s)]
*  also anxious to just see if they can recover any precious items that they may have left [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=76.76s)]
*  behind. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=81.76s)]
*  And that's not even a factor in the people who were lucky enough to have their homes [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=83.24s)]
*  untouched by the flames. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=87.24s)]
*  You know, these wildfires are fickle. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=88.72s)]
*  And so you might have blocks of devastation and then a home that's standing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=90.8s)]
*  CBS spoke to one homeowner. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=95.72s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=98.36s)]
*  From what I could see, every house is burnt down on my block, except for my house. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=99.36s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=110.24s)]
*  Everybody behind me. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=112.88s)]
*  How is this? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  How could this even be true? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=117.6s)]
*  And so as you heard, you know, the subtext there, there's a little bit of survivor's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=122.84s)]
*  guilt, if you will, for the people who have their homes still standing. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=127.16s)]
*  But it does beg the question, Errol, what they're going to come back to, because even [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=131.48s)]
*  if the homes are still standing, the structural integrity may be compromised. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=136.0s)]
*  And of course, there are so many toxins in the air from the paint and the heavy metals [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=140.68s)]
*  that burned up all around. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=145.96s)]
*  I can tell you this is day 10 for me covering these wildfires. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=147.52s)]
*  It still smells like a bonfire here and there is no plume of smoke in sight. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=151.56s)]
*  So, you know, that should speak to the air quality concerns in the area as well. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of factors to consider for people who are returning to these disaster zones. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=160.8s)]
*  Yeah, Tom, you make such a good point. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=166.56s)]
*  There are the physical issues, the psychological issues from people being completely uprooted [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=168.16s)]
*  and witnessing this. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=173.16s)]
*  And that's if you were lucky enough to get out. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  We appreciate your underground reporting. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=177.04s)]
*  Do take care of yourself and the team. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VHEo9WU7E&t=179.12s)]
