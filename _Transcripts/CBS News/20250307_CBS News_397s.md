# New Trump executive orders expected as he threatens reciprocal tariffs on Canada
**CBS News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE)
*  President Trump is set to sign new executive orders this afternoon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=0.0s)]
*  Now details on what exactly the orders are about have not been released, but CBS News [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=4.16s)]
*  has confirmed the president is working on an order in the days ahead that would dismantle [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=8.8s)]
*  the Department of Education. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=13.96s)]
*  Just a day after the president temporarily paused his 25 percent tariffs on some Mexican [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=16.04s)]
*  and Canadian imports for the next month, he's now threatening to impose new reciprocal tariffs [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=20.56s)]
*  on our neighbor to the north if they don't ease their taxes on American goods. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=25.44s)]
*  They'll be met with the exact same tariff unless they drop it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  And that's what reciprocal means. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=34.96s)]
*  And we may do it as early as today or we'll wait till Monday or Tuesday. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=37.24s)]
*  But that's what we're going to do. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=42.08s)]
*  We're going to charge the same thing. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=43.08s)]
*  It's not fair, never has been fair. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  And they've treated our farmers badly. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=47.24s)]
*  Look, our country has been ripped off by everybody. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  That stops now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=51.56s)]
*  In addition to Canada, the president is threatening additional sanctions on Russia in an effort [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=53.4s)]
*  to bring the war with Ukraine to an end. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  In a post on Truth Social, President Trump said in part, quote, I am strongly considering [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=59.96s)]
*  large scale banking sanctions, sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and final [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=64.6s)]
*  settlement agreement on peace is reached, end quote. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=70.88s)]
*  Despite market uncertainty regarding tariffs, the Trump administration is praising the release [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=74.32s)]
*  of the first jobs numbers of the president's second term in office. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=78.36s)]
*  Last month, the U.S. added 151,000 new jobs, which falls slightly below experts predictions. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=82.3s)]
*  Joining us now is CBS News senior White House correspondent, Weijia Jiang. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=88.62s)]
*  Weijia, good to see you. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=91.7s)]
*  President Trump says Canada could be hit with reciprocal tariffs as soon as today. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=92.89999999999999s)]
*  What more do we know? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=97.06s)]
*  Is this the first batch of Canadian tariffs against a certain number, billions of dollars [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=98.06s)]
*  in U.S. goods? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=102.5s)]
*  So it's hard to keep track, I know, because we are talking about tariffs all the time. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=105.5s)]
*  But you'll remember earlier this week, U.S. tariffs went into place on Canadian and Mexican [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=110.82s)]
*  goods. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=118.44s)]
*  And at the time, Canada responded right away with retaliatory tariffs. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=119.66s)]
*  Since then, we have seen more development. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=125.41999999999999s)]
*  We've seen a one month exemption for Canadian and Mexican goods that are compliant under [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=128.14s)]
*  the USMCA trade agreement. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=134.26s)]
*  We've also seen a one month exemption for automakers. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=136.74s)]
*  What Trump is talking about now is retaliating for the response that Canada already gave. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=141.1s)]
*  So you have the original tariffs, you have the Canadian response, now this is the U.S. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=148.06s)]
*  response to that, specifically on Canadian lumber and dairy. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=152.5s)]
*  And so to answer your question, Lindsay, it is a sign that the president is following [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=157.38s)]
*  through with what he has always said, which is, you know, if you put something on us, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=162.10000000000002s)]
*  we're going to have a reciprocal tariff. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=166.9s)]
*  Now this is not to be confused with the global reciprocal tariffs that are coming on April [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=170.94s)]
*  2nd for all countries that currently impose a fee on American exports. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=176.1s)]
*  That will also include Canada, Mexico, China, but way beyond that, Lindsay, many other countries. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=182.02s)]
*  And even though Trump has received some criticism and pushback, not only from American companies [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=189.06s)]
*  but from American consumers who want to know what this means for their bottom line, he is all in. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=194.82000000000002s)]
*  He was directly asked today how much of a disturbance this could cause the average [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=201.62s)]
*  American and for how long can you give a dollar figure of any kind? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=205.74s)]
*  And he did not answer specifics, but again, defended his plan to continue using tariffs, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=210.22s)]
*  he says, to bring manufacturing roaring back to the U.S., Lindsay. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=216.38s)]
*  But it should be noted that that, of course, takes time. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=220.62s)]
*  It could take years. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=223.46s)]
*  And in the meantime, there could be some real impact on American consumers. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=224.62s)]
*  It is a twisted way of tariffs. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=229.94s)]
*  Thank you for spelling that out for us and helping us follow along. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=231.18s)]
*  So what would these Russian sanctions look like? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=233.94s)]
*  And does the president have plans right now to get both sides to the table? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=236.26000000000002s)]
*  He says that he is still working on a peace deal. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=240.5s)]
*  In fact, he said today, almost in the same sentence, Lindsay, that's notable. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=244.18s)]
*  He said that, you know, Russia is bombing the hell out of Ukraine. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=247.94s)]
*  But he went on to say that he believes Vladimir Putin really wants peace. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=251.17999999999998s)]
*  He actually added that it's Ukraine that's more difficult, he said, quite frankly, to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=255.5s)]
*  work with right now on a peace deal than Russia. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=261.86s)]
*  All that said, he does still believe that he will be able to negotiate something in [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=265.21999999999997s)]
*  the end. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=269.21999999999997s)]
*  But he has also sent a warning shot to Russia to say that we have more options on the table [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=270.21999999999997s)]
*  when it comes to sanctions, whether that's Russian oil, whether that's other Russian [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=276.3s)]
*  banks that are currently not being sanctioned or even sanctioning China for doing business [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=281.18s)]
*  with Russia. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=286.06s)]
*  Those are potential options that the White House says Trump is not going to hesitate [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=287.18s)]
*  to use if necessary. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=292.02000000000004s)]
*  Let's talk crypto. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=294.38000000000005s)]
*  President Trump is set to host a summit on cryptocurrency this afternoon. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=295.38000000000005s)]
*  He signed an executive order to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve on Thursday. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=298.94000000000005s)]
*  What does that mean and what is the goal of this summit? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=303.86s)]
*  So the bottom line of this summit, Lindsay, is to essentially welcome these tech titans [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=306.66s)]
*  to the White House to reset the relationship between especially crypto CEOs and the U.S. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=311.74s)]
*  government. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=319.86s)]
*  These leaders claim that it was very difficult to work with the Biden administration on regulation, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=320.86s)]
*  on sort of what the role of the U.S. government would be. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=326.74s)]
*  And so that is why Trump has invited them here today to talk about these two new actions [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=329.94s)]
*  that he has taken through executive order. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=336.26s)]
*  So as an example for the digital reserves, if the U.S. government were to seize assets [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=338.66s)]
*  that are in digital form, now there's something, somewhere to put them. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=344.24s)]
*  But I think more, Lindsay, it's really an outreach to essentially thank a lot of these [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=348.38s)]
*  guys who poured a lot into his reelection campaign. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=353.22s)]
*  And it shows that Trump is trying to carry through on his campaign promise of making [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=357.9s)]
*  the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=363.02s)]
*  But we should also note, Lindsay, that according to various studies, just about 17 to 28 percent, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=366.18s)]
*  somewhere in there, depending on what research study you're looking at. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=372.9s)]
*  That's how many Americans currently have investments into crypto. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=376.21999999999997s)]
*  So it's certainly not the majority of the country that this impacts. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=379.53999999999996s)]
*  Even David Sacks, who is in charge of this effort, along with artificial intelligence, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=383.82s)]
*  insists that these moves through the executive order are not going to cost taxpayers any [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=388.54s)]
*  extra money. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=395.21999999999997s)]
*  Weijia Jiang, thank you. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_r22N2VUE&t=396.21999999999997s)]
