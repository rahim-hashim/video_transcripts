# Thousands of EPA employees warned of immediate termination
**CBS News:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s)
*  Hundreds of employees at the Environmental Protection Agency have been advised they're [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=0.0s)]
*  at risk of losing their jobs. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=5.08s)]
*  More than 1,100 EPA employees who are less than a year into their current roles, even [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=6.96s)]
*  though some of them may have worked in other roles within the EPA for years, have received [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=12.0s)]
*  an email warning that they could be terminated. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=16.38s)]
*  I want to bring in Tracy Wolfe of our CBS News climate unit. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=19.0s)]
*  Tracy, as you know, attitudes from administrations can change, politically and otherwise. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=22.96s)]
*  You've talked to people at the agency. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=29.799999999999997s)]
*  Does this feel different to them? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=32.76s)]
*  Do they feel in real jeopardy? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=34.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=36.12s)]
*  So in speaking to union officials, former EPA employees that talk to their current colleagues, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=37.12s)]
*  the morale is incredibly low. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=43.6s)]
*  In fact, the head of the union for the EPA said she's been there 30 years and this is [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  the worst she's ever seen the morale. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  It is a very chaotic state inside the agency at the moment and there's a lot of fear among [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=52.64s)]
*  the employees. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=57.68s)]
*  Tracy, I tried to allude to this. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=59.2s)]
*  We're not talking about, because people might conceive of, oh, these are just temps or people [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  who just got there. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=64.64s)]
*  In some cases, they might have less than a year in a job, meaning they're brand new to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=65.86s)]
*  the agency. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=69.88s)]
*  But as I understand it from your reporting, that's not true of all of these folks. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=70.88s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=74.36s)]
*  So what the union rep told me was more than 1,100 employees received this email. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=75.36s)]
*  To your point, some of them have been at the agency for less than a year, but some of them [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=79.84s)]
*  employees who've been in federal work for decades who may have transferred into the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=84.92s)]
*  agency or maybe in a new role internally in the agency. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=89.56s)]
*  And they also received this message. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=92.6s)]
*  And Tracy, does it come across in this context for these employees what the goal the incoming [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=94.88s)]
*  Trump administration is with the EPA itself? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=101.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=104.4s)]
*  I think what we're seeing with the USAID agency at the moment may be a blueprint for how they're [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=106.84s)]
*  going to try to interact with some of these other agencies. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=111.96s)]
*  We know that the Environmental Protection Agency is a very large workforce. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=115.08s)]
*  More than 15,000 employees has a budget of nine billion dollars. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=118.88s)]
*  And a lot of the work of the EPA, I would argue, stands in direct opposition to what [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=122.91999999999999s)]
*  President Trump aims to do with his political and economic agenda. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=129.12s)]
*  And so I imagine that they are hoping to purge a lot of these employees to help cut down [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=132.64s)]
*  the red tape of the environmental oversight and bureaucracy that goes into environmental [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=137.04s)]
*  permitting, especially for a lot of energy projects that the president aims to develop [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=141.76s)]
*  over his next term. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=146.24s)]
*  And yet there are those who would say the EPA is there to provide a safer America environmentally. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=148.06s)]
*  Is that in jeopardy? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=153.54s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=154.54s)]
*  The EPA's role is to protect health and human health and the environment. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=156.2s)]
*  That is what many of these employees have dedicated their lives to. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=160.78s)]
*  And so there is definitely a concern that should all of these employees be purged, who [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  will be there to do the work? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=169.36s)]
*  And more importantly, a lot of these employees help oversee grants, grants that have been [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=171.16s)]
*  handed out all across the country, local, state, private sectors to do some of this [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=174.84s)]
*  work. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=180.36s)]
*  If those employees aren't there to help oversee the grants, then what happens? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=181.36s)]
*  Tracy Wolf, thank you very much. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzM6Wlm6p-s&t=185.24s)]
