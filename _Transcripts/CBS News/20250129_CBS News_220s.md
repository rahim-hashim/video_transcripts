# RFK Jr. going before Senate for confirmation hearing
**CBS News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc)
*  All right, this morning on Capitol Hill, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=0.0s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will be grilled by senators [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=1.68s)]
*  during his confirmation hearing to become Health and Human [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=4.28s)]
*  Services Secretary. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=6.82s)]
*  RFK Jr. once led President Trump's Make America Healthy [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=8.56s)]
*  Again movement. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=11.76s)]
*  He's also made controversial remarks about vaccines. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=12.64s)]
*  And he's falsely claimed that vaccines cause autism. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=15.74s)]
*  He's also pledged major changes at the CDC and FDA. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=19.34s)]
*  These are agencies he would oversee. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=22.56s)]
*  And the Senate Judiciary Committee [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=24.92s)]
*  will hold a vote today on Pam Bondi's nomination [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=27.119999999999997s)]
*  for US Attorney General. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=29.959999999999997s)]
*  The former Florida State Attorney General [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=31.52s)]
*  has told the committee that she would never play politics [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=33.28s)]
*  as head of the DOJ. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=35.8s)]
*  CBS News congressional correspondent Caitlin Huey-Burns [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=37.44s)]
*  is on the Hill following this for us. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=39.92s)]
*  You appear to be standing where all the grilling or complimenting [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=42.54s)]
*  will be taking place today. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  We know that yesterday, RFK Jr.'s cousin, Caroline Kennedy, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=48.599999999999994s)]
*  sent a blistering letter to senators [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  calling him a predator. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=54.76s)]
*  You tried to get a response from him on that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=56.68s)]
*  What did he say or not say? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=58.76s)]
*  Hey, Errol, great to be with you. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=62.08s)]
*  Yeah, this is the room where it happens. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=63.4s)]
*  Kennedy is going to be taking those questions at that table [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=65.32s)]
*  right behind me. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=67.84s)]
*  You mentioned this letter coming from Caroline Kennedy, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=69.32s)]
*  his first cousin. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=72.72s)]
*  She's the daughter of President John F. Kennedy. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  And what's remarkable about this letter [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=76.6s)]
*  is that we've seen lots of criticism [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=78.6s)]
*  from other members of Kennedy's family. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=80.96s)]
*  Remember, during the campaign, a lot of his cousins [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=83.8s)]
*  and a lot of family members came out in opposition to him. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=86.56s)]
*  But Caroline Kennedy, who's also a former ambassador, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=89.64s)]
*  has been largely behind the scenes, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=92.44s)]
*  hasn't really come out in public to weigh in. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=94.64s)]
*  And that was what was significant about her letter [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  because she said, you know, I typically [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  don't do this sort of thing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=101.64s)]
*  Now, Kennedy himself, when I asked him about this [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=104.28s)]
*  several times over the course of the afternoon yesterday, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=107.24s)]
*  didn't respond, didn't respond to any questions [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=110.24s)]
*  we had about how he's preparing for this at all either. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=112.64s)]
*  But we will see whether this has any sort of impact. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=116.0s)]
*  I can tell you from my reporting and talking to lawmakers, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=119.6s)]
*  it's very doubtful that a letter like that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=122.56s)]
*  will sway anyone that's on the fence one way or the other. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=125.28s)]
*  You do have some lawmakers who are more reserved, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=130.56s)]
*  more skeptical of Kennedy [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=133.72s)]
*  and his past controversial statements. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=136.44s)]
*  This letter isn't likely to do anything [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=138.76s)]
*  to push them one way or the other. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=141.28s)]
*  But remember, it is going to be a narrow confirmation vote. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=142.76s)]
*  He can only afford to lose three Republican senators [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=146.92s)]
*  if all the Democrats vote against him. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=150.64s)]
*  And Caitlin, what other cabinet nominees [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=153.72s)]
*  have hearings this week and what are the levels [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=156.16s)]
*  of challenges they are expected to face? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=159.68s)]
*  Yeah, Errol, it is a big week here on Capitol Hill. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=163.84s)]
*  Actually, tomorrow, Kennedy will have another hearing [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=166.28s)]
*  with a health committee. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=169.08s)]
*  And then also tomorrow, these are two big blockbuster [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=171.16s)]
*  hearings that we're looking for. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=174.04s)]
*  Cash Patel to head up the FBI, he's Trump's choice, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=175.36s)]
*  and also Tulsi Gabbard to lead, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=179.56s)]
*  to be director of national intelligence. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=181.96s)]
*  These are two very controversial picks. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=184.32s)]
*  And Gabbard especially is going to have [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=186.32s)]
*  a very difficult confirmation fight [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=189.24s)]
*  to get the support that she needs. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  And we're waiting to see whether and how Donald Trump himself [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=193.84s)]
*  starts to apply that pressure perhaps publicly [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=198.4s)]
*  to some Republicans who may be on the fence. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=201.96s)]
*  All right, Caitlin Huey-Burns, thank you so much. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  And folks, we'll see her a bit later on [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=207.52s)]
*  during a special report on Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=209.84s)]
*  confirmation hearing. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  We'll bring that to you live right here on CBS News 24 seven. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  It all begins at 10 a.m. Eastern. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a-kizQXDHc&t=217.68s)]
