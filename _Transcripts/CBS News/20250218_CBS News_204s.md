*  Here in New York to step down as governor Kathy Hockel weighs whether or not to remove him [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=14.1s)]
*  Anna Schechter joins me now here at the table and it's great to see you. Thanks for joining us [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  So what are the contours of this story? Where are things right now? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=23.56s)]
*  Well tomorrow at 2 p.m. A federal judge Judge Dale tow will hold a hearing he's requiring the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=26.759999999999998s)]
*  Trump Department of Justice and Mayor Adams team to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  To show up and the Department of Justice has to explain their reasoning why these charges should be dropped [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=38.8s)]
*  Now there's a whole backstory to this [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=46.0s)]
*  Let's go back to November 2023 when mayor Adams cell phone was confiscated as part of an investigation [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=48.64s)]
*  that led to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=55.4s)]
*  September 2024 [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=57.04s)]
*  charges of corruption bribery a very sort of fanciful narrative of him getting lavish trips to Istanbul and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=58.64s)]
*  the allegation is that he was [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=66.92s)]
*  essentially currying favor with the Turkish government and allowing for them to build a consulate here without the proper permits [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=69.6s)]
*  So multiple charges levied against him now. He has held firm, but [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=77.2s)]
*  What was extraordinary last week is the Department of Justice issued a memo [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=82.75999999999999s)]
*  Mandating that the charges be dropped now a Trump appointed Southern District prosecutor resigned [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=87.8s)]
*  Even though she is was not an ally of mayor Adams at all [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=94.32s)]
*  or [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=99.08s)]
*  Really? She's not a resistance person at all. So to speak self-proclaimed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=100.52s)]
*  But she resigned because she felt that it was so unjust [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=105.44s)]
*  That this kind of quid pro quo was completely in her like a quid pro quo [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=110.12s)]
*  Even though the mayor has repeatedly denied that and she even noted in a footnote in her memo to Attorney General [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=114.68s)]
*  Pam Bondi she wrote in January there was a meeting where a meal bovey [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=120.76s)]
*  Was essential the Attorney General Deputy Attorney General was talking to members of her team and Adams lawyers [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=126.92s)]
*  And she perceived that Adams team was saying we will play ball with you and immigration enforcement in New York City [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=133.7s)]
*  If these charges go away and it's for that reason that meeting that she wrote about [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=140.74s)]
*  In that little footnote in the fine print [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=146.57999999999998s)]
*  I think it all goes down to that she just couldn't stomach it separate from this judge in this hearing tomorrow [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=149.06s)]
*  Anna does the governor of New York have the power the governor of New York to remove the mayor of New York City? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=154.7s)]
*  It's an extraordinary power that has never been used in the more than 230 year history of the state of New York and so governor Hockel has [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=159.98s)]
*  Understandably been reticent to use that power because she has felt this could be undemocratic voters voted him in [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=168.06s)]
*  Why not just wait it out in November, you know a few months away. There's another election. He's up for reelection [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=174.82s)]
*  Why not let the voters decide? However, she changed her tune last night and said she is considering it [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=180.5s)]
*  She held meetings with top Democrat leaders today [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=186.28s)]
*  From her Manhattan office, so we shall see we didn't hear today if she's going to do anything [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=189.70000000000002s)]
*  Our reporting indicates she wants to see what the judge does tomorrow and then make a decision Anna Schechter [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=195.98000000000002s)]
*  Thank you very very much for breaking all that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhlJakXza8&t=202.18s)]
