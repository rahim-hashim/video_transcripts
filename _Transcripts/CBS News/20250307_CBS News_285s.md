# White House hosts first cryptocurrency summit
**CBS News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ)
*  Welcome back to America Decides. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Leaders from the cryptocurrency industry gathered at the White House today for its first ever [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=3.0s)]
*  digital asset summit, where President Trump delivered remarks. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=7.4s)]
*  Last year I promised to make America the bitcoin superpower of the world and the crypto capital [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=12.22s)]
*  of the planet and we're taking historic action to deliver on that promise. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Victoria Guido joins us now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=23.6s)]
*  She is an economics correspondent for Politico. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=25.34s)]
*  Victoria, so good to see you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=29.08s)]
*  Back in 2019 Trump bashed crypto as something, quote, whose value is highly volatile and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=30.84s)]
*  based on thin air. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=36.96s)]
*  What changed? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=38.88s)]
*  Well, there is a huge group of voters here that was involved in voting for the president. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=39.88s)]
*  There was also a lot of crypto money that went into funding the president's campaign [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  along with a lot of lawmakers that were just elected. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=51.04s)]
*  And so the crypto industry has sort of convinced Washington that they're a force to be reckoned [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=53.84s)]
*  with, that they should be listened to. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=57.68s)]
*  You had all these crypto leaders united in person at the White House today, but you recently [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=60.56s)]
*  wrote an article that dove into how fractured this industry actually is. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=65.0s)]
*  Tell us a little bit more about that. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=70.0s)]
*  Yeah, so when you hear the word crypto, one of the things that's very confusing about [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=71.88s)]
*  it is that people still don't entirely agree on what it's for, what it's useful for. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=76.0s)]
*  And so if you think about bitcoin, right, it was originally conceived of as a currency, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=80.8s)]
*  something that you were supposed to use to pay for things. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=85.12s)]
*  But the way that we really talk about crypto these days is about as an investment, where [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  it's useful to be able to invest in because the price is going to go up. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=92.08s)]
*  And actually, that doesn't make it a very good currency. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=95.04s)]
*  And so there is a lot of conflict about what crypto should be, what it should look like [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=98.4s)]
*  and how decentralized it should be, because you have a coin like bitcoin where nobody [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=104.72s)]
*  really controls it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=110.34s)]
*  You have other crypto coins that are controlled by firms, and that just leads to a lot of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=111.46000000000001s)]
*  different interests that are pushing in a lot of different directions. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=117.06s)]
*  In your article, you called the crypto industry, quote, a complicated blend of grift and innovation. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=120.74000000000001s)]
*  Explain why you characterized it that way and what needs to change in order to be less [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=128.02s)]
*  grift, more innovation. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=132.74s)]
*  Well, that's sort of the question. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=134.54s)]
*  So the reason why it's innovative is because there is a lot of reasons why crypto is sort [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=137.54s)]
*  of a more technologically efficient way to do finance. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=142.6s)]
*  And so you actually hear people in the traditional finance world talk about what they call tokenizing, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=145.45999999999998s)]
*  something, you know, a normal traditional asset like a stock or a bond, because you [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=150.66s)]
*  can create sort of faster, more efficient ways of moving assets. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=154.89999999999998s)]
*  But one of the things that's sort of unsettled about crypto is there isn't very much rules [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=160.73999999999998s)]
*  around it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=167.02s)]
*  And so it opens the door for people to create a crypto for whatever purpose, just have people [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=168.7s)]
*  plow money into it, and then those people might get screwed. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=174.26s)]
*  And so what the hope that the hope that I have and the hope that a lot of people have [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=177.3s)]
*  for what Washington will do is that they'll put rules around this so that you're sort [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=182.54s)]
*  of encouraging a situation where the useful purposes of crypto, whatever those may be, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  are encouraged and the situations where people might have the rug pulled out from under them [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=193.8s)]
*  and lose money, those are less encouraged. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=198.04000000000002s)]
*  So then what do you make of the president's new executive order yesterday that establishes [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=201.12s)]
*  a strategic Bitcoin reserve and particularly his choice of Bitcoin over all the other [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=205.88000000000002s)]
*  cryptocurrencies out there? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=211.88000000000002s)]
*  What's the significance of that? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=213.28s)]
*  So he created two different things. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=215.16000000000003s)]
*  There was the strategic Bitcoin reserve, as you mentioned, and then there was also the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=217.06s)]
*  digital asset stockpile. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  And both of these are supposed to be based on crypto assets that the government has seized, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  that law enforcement has seized in criminal cases. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=227.28s)]
*  The difference is that they left open the door for the government to buy more Bitcoin. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=230.12s)]
*  They said that this would have to be in a taxpayer neutral way, so it can't cost the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=235.44s)]
*  government net money. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=240.44s)]
*  It's really unclear how exactly that would work. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=242.04s)]
*  But they basically say that Bitcoin is fundamentally different because it is particularly decentralized, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=245.0s)]
*  right? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=250.04s)]
*  Who could potentially pull the strings because so many people have to be involved and to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=251.79999999999998s)]
*  agree on the rules governing the Bitcoin framework. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=255.95999999999998s)]
*  But in terms of what it's useful for, that's a little bit less clear. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=261.5s)]
*  They're calling it a digital Fort Knox to sort of point to the fact that the U.S. has [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=265.08s)]
*  a huge stockpile of gold that we amassed back when there used to be a gold standard. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=269.08s)]
*  But we don't really use that gold for anything. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=273.98s)]
*  It is just sort of sitting there. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=275.94s)]
*  And so it's sort of an open question what that would be for. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=277.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=279.48s)]
*  It's a brave new world. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=280.48s)]
*  Victoria Aguita, thank you so much for joining us today. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=281.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcQhem5rVzQ&t=284.44s)]
