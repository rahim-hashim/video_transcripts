# Senate committee advances Tulsi Gabbard's nomination as director of national intelligence
**CBS News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8)
*  Now to Capitol Hill, where a Senate committee has advanced the nomination of Tulsi Gabbard [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=0.0s)]
*  to be the next director of national intelligence. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=4.0s)]
*  A live look at the Capitol dome for you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=7.0s)]
*  Lawmakers voted along party lines last night. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=9.0s)]
*  The vote, the final vote in the Senate is expected this week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=12.0s)]
*  Gabbard is one of President Trump's more controversial picks, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=15.0s)]
*  with some senators expressing concerns over her 2017 meeting [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=19.0s)]
*  with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and her past comments on the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=23.0s)]
*  CBS News congressional reporter Torian Small is following all of this. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=28.0s)]
*  Forrest from Capitol Hill joins us now as you see on your screens. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=32.0s)]
*  Torian, does Gabbard face any additional hurdles in getting confirmed? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=35.0s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't look like it, especially considering we know from former on the fence Republicans [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=40.0s)]
*  like Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=47.0s)]
*  She's lending her support behind Gabbard. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=49.0s)]
*  This comes after Susan Collins, another, I would say, not so friendly [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=52.0s)]
*  to Trump Republican on the Hill said that she's also supporting him. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=57.0s)]
*  But who we were watching initially when her name came up for committee vote [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=61.0s)]
*  was Senator Todd Young of Indiana. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=66.0s)]
*  Just reports about reservations around Gabbard forced many in the Trump orbit [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=69.0s)]
*  to start this intense pressure campaign against Young. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=75.0s)]
*  He ultimately had a discussion with Elon Musk that gave him some assurances. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=79.0s)]
*  And then, of course, he also talked to some members from the White House [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=85.0s)]
*  and he said that he would be voting her out of committee. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=88.0s)]
*  The countdown is on now. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=91.0s)]
*  Around 5.30 yesterday, Republicans voted to start the procedure [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=94.0s)]
*  to get that final vote for her on the floor. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=100.0s)]
*  We're about 16 hours away from when that will happen, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=103.0s)]
*  so she could be confirmed as soon as 11.30 tonight. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=106.0s)]
*  And one of the other more controversial cabinet picks for Trump is Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=110.0s)]
*  He faces a confirmation vote this week also. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=114.0s)]
*  What can we expect there? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=117.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's also looking at a similar timeline of events. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=119.0s)]
*  After Gabbard's name is voted out of the Senate floor, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=122.0s)]
*  then another 30 hours starts for R.F.K. Jr. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=127.0s)]
*  But again, it doesn't look like he's going to face much pushback from Republicans. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=131.0s)]
*  The primary Republican on the Senate Health Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=135.0s)]
*  who said that he gave pause, some of his testimony gave him pause, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=145.0s)]
*  ultimately decided that after having conversations with J.D. Vance, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=150.0s)]
*  after having conversations, many conversations with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=154.0s)]
*  he decided that he will be voting for him. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=158.0s)]
*  We're still waiting to see what Lisa Mikowski, what Susan Collins have to say. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=160.0s)]
*  But even if those two defect, even if Mitch McConnell joins them, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=164.0s)]
*  there just aren't the four, the magic number four Republicans needed to block his confirmation. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=168.0s)]
*  And Torian, Speaker Mike Johnson is reportedly planning on proposing a brand new budget bill. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=173.0s)]
*  What do we know about this and how it's likely to be received? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=179.0s)]
*  Well, he's looking at a March 14 deadline. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=183.0s)]
*  That's when the government will shut down if they fail to pass a budget bill within that time span. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=186.0s)]
*  It's also no longer the onus on Democrats to help out with these plans. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=193.0s)]
*  Republicans are talking about this aggressive agenda that they're looking to push through [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=198.0s)]
*  through the budget reconciliation process. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=202.0s)]
*  That allows them, at least Senate Republicans, to bypass the filibuster rules [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=204.0s)]
*  in order to push through this legislation. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=209.0s)]
*  The thing is here, and this is what I found pretty instructive about what Johnson is saying, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=211.0s)]
*  Speaker Johnson is saying about this. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=215.0s)]
*  He said that he had a conversation with Lindsey Graham a few days ago. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=216.0s)]
*  And during that conversation, he said whatever effort you guys are doing might be moot [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=220.0s)]
*  because he has to whip up 218 votes in his chamber, that very slim majority, in order to pass something. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=225.0s)]
*  So he's asking Senate Republicans to follow their lead in the House [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=232.0s)]
*  before they decide to push through a competing bill, as we know that's happening at the same time. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=237.0s)]
*  So it looks like we could see a budget battle happen sooner than later here. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=243.0s)]
*  All right. We know you'll be across all of that, Torian Small. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=247.0s)]
*  Thanks very much. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl3-S5wv-E8&t=249.0s)]
