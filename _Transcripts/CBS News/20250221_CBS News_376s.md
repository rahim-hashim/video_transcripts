# Angry voters confront Republican congressman over DOGE cuts at town hall
**CBS News:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs)
*  I think it's going to be a litigating court. You don't think I'm going to stand for you? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=0.0s)]
*  Stand for you? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=3.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no! [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=4.0s)]
*  Queens! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=6.0s)]
*  I don't believe it! [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=8.0s)]
*  Okay, one town hall during a congressional recess doesn't speak for America. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=10.0s)]
*  But there was a town hall in the 7th Congressional District in Georgia. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=16.0s)]
*  That's north of Atlanta. Republican Rich McCormick was there. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=20.0s)]
*  Yes, progressives from his district got there early, got all the seats. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=24.0s)]
*  There were Republicans and Trump supporters there, but it was a raucous crowd. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=28.0s)]
*  And the crowd there expressed some measure of anger over the Department of Government Efficiency, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=31.0s)]
*  reduction of federal jobs, and perhaps future spending cuts. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=37.0s)]
*  It's worth noting that other Republican lawmakers during this same congressional recess encountered some pushback in their district. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=42.0s)]
*  So, what does this all mean? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=51.0s)]
*  Julie Grace Prufke and Finn Gomez join me now at the table. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=54.0s)]
*  Julie Grace, senior political correspondent at The Daily Beast. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=57.0s)]
*  Finn, of course, our esteemed CBS News political director. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=60.0s)]
*  All right, Rich McCormick's district, plus 22, meaning plus 22 Republican. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=64.0s)]
*  So, not that many progressives, and they all got there early. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=69.0s)]
*  So, Julie Grace, does this mean anything? Is this a potential tremor the Trump world ought to pay attention to? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=71.0s)]
*  So, I mean, I definitely think that it is kind of—I've talked to a number of lawmakers today about this issue. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=78.0s)]
*  You did? Okay, what did they tell you? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=83.0s)]
*  I think a lot of districts across the country, they're facing some backlash. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=85.0s)]
*  I talked to one lawmaker today that said they've—and one big problem they faced from constituents reaching out [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=89.0s)]
*  are some of these probationary federal workers that have kind of been on for a year, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=95.0s)]
*  that have been fired over what they're saying are performance issues, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=99.0s)]
*  but ultimately aren't where people are losing their security clearances and saying they're these poor performers. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=103.0s)]
*  It's kind of hindering their ability to get new jobs, which is a big thing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=108.0s)]
*  Whether they were poor performers or not, they're just sort of being declared that, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=112.0s)]
*  and they don't have any recourse, and they're losing their job, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=116.0s)]
*  and that might jeopardize their employment prospects going forward. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=119.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=122.0s)]
*  That's going to tick you off as a constituent. You're going to pick up the phone if that's true. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=123.0s)]
*  So, they're hearing a lot of that, and I mean, I have talked to some lawmakers that are like, it's playing well. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=126.0s)]
*  They like to see the shrinking of government. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=130.0s)]
*  Federal workers aren't really a group of people that the average Joe's that concerned about. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=132.0s)]
*  But I mean, some of these, especially military districts, and I mean, kind of across the country, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=137.0s)]
*  I think there are definitely raising, there are some concerns that are being raised where it is becoming a problem, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=141.0s)]
*  especially just kind of the way they're going about it, which a lot of these voters are saying has been kind of haphazard. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=146.0s)]
*  Fannie, I'll get to you in just one second. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=152.0s)]
*  I want to play for both of you, soundbite from yesterday's White House briefing, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=153.0s)]
*  because our Nancy Cordes asked the National Economic Council Director, Kevin, Keith Hassett, rather, about this idea of, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=156.0s)]
*  well, are some people being laid off who are not poor performers? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=163.0s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=167.0s)]
*  We're being told by a lot of people who have been let go at other agencies that they were told they were being dismissed because of poor performance, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=168.0s)]
*  when in some cases they haven't even had a performance review yet because they've only been on the job a couple of months. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=176.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've never seen a person who was laid off for poor performance say that they were performing poorly. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=181.0s)]
*  Kind of high on the GLIB scale. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=190.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=192.0s)]
*  I think what you're seeing there, and I think also we're seeing what we saw yesterday at CPAC, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=193.0s)]
*  the annual gathering of conservatives is really a mega gathering of conservatives with the now infamous Elon Musk chainsaw moment, right? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=198.0s)]
*  I think you've got that picture in control room, if you want to bring that up, that Finn is referring to. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=208.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's like, stemming from the president of Argentina, Javier Malé, there was a symbol for cutting the budget there, but it's done so. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=212.0s)]
*  One of the issues here is what we're seeing major, and what I've been hearing from some Democrats as well about this, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=219.0s)]
*  is that there's like a lack of empathy overall in these cuts. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=225.0s)]
*  They're steamrolling it, it's kind of messy, it's having this impact, and then there's also like a spiking of the football in the end zone [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=228.0s)]
*  without really caring that this is like impacting people, actual people. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=237.0s)]
*  These aren't just numbers, these are people, families, and kids. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=242.0s)]
*  Natalie Brand, one of our correspondents, went out to Northern Virginia where a fair number of federal employees work, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=245.0s)]
*  and it wasn't just those individuals directly impacted, she was talking to people who support, who run businesses [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=250.0s)]
*  that depend on the wherewithal of the federal workforce itself, so the downstream effects are also there. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=257.0s)]
*  Absolutely, and I think that's something that Republicans are hearing back home, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=264.0s)]
*  and it's going to be interesting kind of when they come back and they have their conference meeting on next Tuesday on how they're going to navigate a lot of this. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=268.0s)]
*  So I think there's a, I mean it was a big celebration at first, and now that they're kind of, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=274.0s)]
*  we'll see how much pushback the White House gets once they all kind of come back and discuss it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=278.0s)]
*  Julie Grace, you've got some interesting reporting on another Doge adjacent issue, which is this kicking about, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=283.0s)]
*  maybe it's all just rhetorical this week, of whoa, we take some of the savings and we turn it into checks that go back to the taxpayers. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=291.0s)]
*  And who wants to sign checks going back to taxpayers more than Donald, John, Trump? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=297.0s)]
*  I don't know anyone who wants to do that more than he does, but the Speaker of the House, not yet sold. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=302.0s)]
*  Yeah, so there's been chatter about these $5,000 Doge checks on it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=307.0s)]
*  Which is an extrapolation of even savings that haven't even been realized yet. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=311.0s)]
*  Yeah, so it's, I mean, I think a ways off, but we heard Mike Johnson at CPAC kind of throw some cold water on that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=316.0s)]
*  He's like, the national debt's wildly high, these checks would be great for us in an election year, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=321.0s)]
*  with midterms coming up, but it doesn't feel like that's the best way things are. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=326.0s)]
*  And that's also, Julie Grace, reflective of what he, the Speaker, knows is the coming battle for votes on the budget resolution. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=330.0s)]
*  Because if you're going to be cutting spending to pay for tax cuts, you need all the spending cuts you can bank in order to finance that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=338.0s)]
*  Absolutely, and Stephen Miller kind of made clear the other day during one of the White House briefings [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=347.0s)]
*  that the reconciliation process would have to take place before they kind of figured out whether that was a possibility. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=351.0s)]
*  So, I mean, it's going to be kind of interesting to see if that's something they do push forward on, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=356.0s)]
*  but I do think the fiscal hawks are probably going to push back on that being a real thing. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=360.0s)]
*  Finn, I was going to go to you, but the control room says I've got to go to break, so I apologize. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=364.0s)]
*  Next time you're here, you'll get a lot more time. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=368.0s)]
*  No problem. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=370.0s)]
*  Julie Grace-Bufke and Finn Gomez. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=371.0s)]
*  That's what happens on Fridays, kids. You just have to roll with it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2T4q_LtmPs&t=373.0s)]
