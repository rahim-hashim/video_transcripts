# Family member of Hamas hostages speaks out
**CBS News:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA)
*  As we reported earlier, Hamas has released the bodies of four Israeli hostages. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=0.0s)]
*  And this weekend, more living hostages are set to be released from Gaza. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=6.0s)]
*  All of it a part of the ongoing ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas terrorists. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=10.0s)]
*  And among those waiting for their relatives to return is Alana Zaitchik. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=15.0s)]
*  Six of her family members were taken hostage on October 7th. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=19.0s)]
*  And they've all since been released, except one, her cousin's husband, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=23.0s)]
*  David Kunio, who still remains in captivity. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=27.0s)]
*  Alana Zaitchik joins us now from Brooklyn to talk about this. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=30.0s)]
*  Alana, I really appreciate you speaking with us at such a sensitive and difficult time. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=34.0s)]
*  Just let us know how your family is doing right now. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=39.0s)]
*  I think my family, like everyone, is overwhelmed with grief. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=44.0s)]
*  And in particular, my family are best friends with the Bebus family. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=49.0s)]
*  They grew up together and lived a few doors down and we're raising children together. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=53.0s)]
*  So to see them return in coffins is really overwhelming. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=58.0s)]
*  And we're all just very grief stricken. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=62.0s)]
*  I'm completely struck by, you know, seeing their images. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=64.0s)]
*  These are babies. These are such young kids whose bodies are being returned right now. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=68.0s)]
*  What as a family do you say to each other to try and get through this moment? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=73.0s)]
*  I think we just express our love and support for each other. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=77.0s)]
*  I don't think that anyone ever prepared us for these moments. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=80.0s)]
*  I don't think anyone could be prepared for this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=84.0s)]
*  So I think we just try to keep each other strong as best as we can. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=86.0s)]
*  What was your reaction to the ceasefire deal as it was announced? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=91.0s)]
*  And now that as we see so far, it continues to function? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=95.0s)]
*  My reaction was a bit of hopeful optimism, as a lot of us tend to say. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=100.0s)]
*  It's the same deal that's been on the table since last May. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=106.0s)]
*  And so we've been fighting for this deal to go through for a long time. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=110.0s)]
*  I am glad to see it moving forward, but it's still very fragile. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=114.0s)]
*  David and his brother Ariel would not come home until phase two. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=119.0s)]
*  So it's still incredibly fragile. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=123.0s)]
*  And so we remain really committed to keeping the pressure on to keep pushing it through. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=126.0s)]
*  And what are your relatives who were released telling you about their time in captivity? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=131.0s)]
*  And have you seen or heard any updates on the status of Dovey? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=138.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of them that were in captivity and they all had very different experiences. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=142.0s)]
*  Obviously, each experience was a horror show. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=148.0s)]
*  Some of my family members were in tunnels. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=151.0s)]
*  Some of them were in a house and then a hospital. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=153.0s)]
*  One of the children was held by herself for 10 days in the beginning. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=157.0s)]
*  One of the three year old twins. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=161.0s)]
*  So it's a horror show to be held in captivity. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=163.0s)]
*  David, we just actually received a sign of life from a returned hostage who was free, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=167.0s)]
*  who told us that they saw him recently. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=173.0s)]
*  So this has filled my family with a strength that we didn't have before, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=176.0s)]
*  knowing that he's recently been seen alive. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=181.0s)]
*  Some of the hostages who were released early have told me that, you know, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=184.0s)]
*  they're traumatized, of course, from what they went through from your relatives who were released. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=189.0s)]
*  Are they giving you any indication or from your view? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=194.0s)]
*  How long will it take for them to return to their home? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=197.0s)]
*  My cousin Sean says there's no way until David is home. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=201.0s)]
*  I don't think that and I would say that until every single hostage is home, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=205.0s)]
*  I don't think the healing can actually begin. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=209.0s)]
*  The children have nightmares. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=212.0s)]
*  My cousin has PTSD flashbacks of terrorists outside the house. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=214.0s)]
*  And, you know, it's a very, very sad thing. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=218.0s)]
*  And I think that's a very, very sad thing to see. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=221.0s)]
*  And I think that's a very sad thing to see. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi9m-bNS3GA&t=224.0s)]
