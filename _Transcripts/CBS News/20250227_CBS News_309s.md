*  from Hollywood so far on [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=85.56s)]
*  his passing? Yeah, so far the reaction [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=87.64s)]
*  has been what we haven't got that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=89.72s)]
*  much reaction actually because it's [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=91.76s)]
*  broke really, really early in the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  wee hours of the morning and the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=95.36s)]
*  news has been so shocking because [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=97.28s)]
*  he's been such a recluse since [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=99.08s)]
*  he retired a decade ago and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=101.0s)]
*  the news of his death came as a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=102.92s)]
*  shock to his fans to his coworkers. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=104.92s)]
*  But so far, as you said, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=106.92s)]
*  we have Francis Ford Coppola, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=108.68s)]
*  the amazing filmmaker behind [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  the conversation on which they [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=111.68s)]
*  worked together in the 70s. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  Come come forth and call him one [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=114.68s)]
*  of our greats and mourning his loss. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=116.48s)]
*  And you also had Nathan Lane [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=118.8s)]
*  who worked alongside him in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=121.12s)]
*  The Bird Cage, one of my favorite [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=123.12s)]
*  films of all time. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  Mike Nichols, iconic comedy. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  He came forth and posted [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=128.24s)]
*  a statement saying that he [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  that Gene Hackman was one of the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=132.72s)]
*  greats that he had one of the best [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=134.16s)]
*  times working alongside him [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=135.52s)]
*  and called Gene Hackman one [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=138.08s)]
*  of my favorite actors. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=140.08s)]
*  And he also had just fans of the actor, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=142.08s)]
*  many of whom are in Hollywood [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=144.24s)]
*  like Violet Davis, who I don't believe [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=146.72s)]
*  has ever worked with him. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=148.56s)]
*  And she said, I loved everything [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=149.84s)]
*  I've ever seen you in. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  So his fans are really feeling the loss [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  and remembering him for all of his [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=156.08s)]
*  incredible roles over the years. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and we know he worked for more [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  than five decades, so a lot of history [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  and a legacy he's leaving behind there. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=163.84s)]
*  But just how instrumental was he [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  in New Hollywood that grew [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=167.52s)]
*  in the 1970s? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=169.84s)]
*  He had one of the best runs [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  that I can ever recall of an actor [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=173.68s)]
*  over a decade period, and that was [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=175.76s)]
*  in the 1970s. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  So as you said, he got his first Oscar [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  nomination for Bonnie and Clyde, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=180.56s)]
*  and that was near the 70s in 1968 [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  for Best Supporting Actor. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=186.0s)]
*  From then on in, he really just [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  hit the road. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=190.0s)]
*  He got his second best supporting [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=191.04s)]
*  actor nomination in 1970 [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=193.12s)]
*  for I Never Sent for My Father. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=195.2s)]
*  And then just two years later, he won [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  the Best Actor Award for The French [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=199.2s)]
*  Connection, one of his most iconic [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=201.44s)]
*  performances in films. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=203.76s)]
*  And that film also made history [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=204.96s)]
*  at the time for being the first R-rated [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=206.72s)]
*  film to ever win the Best Picture Oscar. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  And then after winning that, he really [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=211.60000000000002s)]
*  varied up his career. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=213.12s)]
*  He didn't do what was expected of him. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=214.56s)]
*  He did some comedy like in Young [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  Frankenstein, and he also [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  appeared as Lex Luther, of course, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=221.84s)]
*  in 1978's Superman and its two sequels. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=224.24s)]
*  So he showed such a versatility [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=227.44s)]
*  in the 70s while also being one [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=229.60000000000002s)]
*  of the most acclaimed actors of that time. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=231.84s)]
*  Yeah, and clearly from just everything [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=234.48s)]
*  you've said there, there are so many [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=236.48s)]
*  films to pick from, but I want to ask [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  you personally, which one would you say [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=239.92s)]
*  stands out to you the most as the best [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=242.56s)]
*  performance? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=244.72s)]
*  All right, so I'm 41. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=245.92s)]
*  So I came of the age when, you know, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=247.2s)]
*  The French Connection had already been [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=249.67999999999998s)]
*  out for a while, but I really [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=251.11999999999998s)]
*  do recall seeing him in The Royal [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  Tenenbaum, one of my favorite films [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=255.04s)]
*  of all time. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=256.56s)]
*  And he played the head of a very [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=257.44s)]
*  eccentric household. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=259.12s)]
*  And he is so good at comedy. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=260.8s)]
*  I feel like that has to be remembered. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=262.48s)]
*  He obviously is incredible in dramatic [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=265.20000000000005s)]
*  action-based roles, but also in his [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=268.08000000000004s)]
*  comedy, he brought a lot of heart [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=270.0s)]
*  and a lot of eccentricity to his [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=272.32s)]
*  performances, especially in that film. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=275.20000000000005s)]
*  And also in this movie, one of his final [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=277.36s)]
*  performances, he played a curmudgeonly [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  older rich gentleman in Heartbreakers, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hStBzzzXWIA&t=282.48s)]
