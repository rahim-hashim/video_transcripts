# Judge orders Trump to temporarily restore funding for foreign assistance programs
**CBS News:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro)
*  But another setback for President Trump as a federal judge orders his administration to reinstate funding for foreign aid contracts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=0.0s)]
*  You may remember all programs under USAID had been put on a 90 day pause so they could be reviewed. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=8.24s)]
*  Well, while that funding freeze has been reversed so far, it's only temporary. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=14.36s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Natalie Brand joins us now from Capitol Hill. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=19.36s)]
*  Natalie, what led up to this decision yesterday? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=23.76s)]
*  What does it mean for USAID and the many groups that that need its support? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=25.96s)]
*  Good morning, Errol. As you noted, this temporarily will allow those funds to flow again. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=32.52s)]
*  And the judge who issued this ruling also blocked the Trump administration from canceling foreign contracts that were made prior to President Trump's inauguration. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=38.24s)]
*  So contracts that were potentially negotiated under the previous administration. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=48.72s)]
*  This is a lawsuit that was brought by two health organizations that receive U.S. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=53.48s)]
*  funding for programs abroad. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=58.96s)]
*  And the plaintiffs described a lot of harm, jeopardizing vital services to vulnerable populations. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  Plaintiffs in the case also described having to lay off employees. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=67.96s)]
*  Now, the judge noted the Trump administration's arguments that this freeze in funding was necessary to conduct a thorough review of each program. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=72.52s)]
*  We're talking about thousands of programs here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=82.56s)]
*  But then he went on to say that administration officials have not offered any explanation of why a blanket suspension of all [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=85.36s)]
*  congressionally appropriated foreign aid, which set off a shockwave and upended contracts with thousands of nonprofit groups, businesses and others, was a rational choice for reviewing these programs. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  Now, the judge is going to make a larger ruling, but he said, you know, absent this initial court order, the scale of harm that's already been done could increase even further. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  Also, Natalie, yesterday, President Trump met with the prime minister of India talking trade and tariffs, among other points, and you had Trump announcing a new policy of reciprocal tariffs. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=120.08s)]
*  Help us understand what that means. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=129.84s)]
*  Yeah, this order essentially directs administration officials to study, begin to look at reciprocal tariffs across countries globally. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=132.16s)]
*  So we don't really have a firm timeline here. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=143.64s)]
*  But what we're talking about is the U.S. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=146.16s)]
*  potentially putting a levy on on goods from countries that already put a tax or tariff on U.S. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=149.16s)]
*  So this would kind of be a tit for tat type of situation. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=159.32s)]
*  But again, we don't have a firm date. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  And it comes on top of the president's other announcements about tariffs on steel and aluminum, the threat for sweeping tariffs on Canada and Mexico. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=165.8s)]
*  That is for now paused. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=176.08s)]
*  The president was asked yesterday by reporters, is he worried about prices increasing to the consumer? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=177.8s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=184.24s)]
*  I think what's going to go up is jobs are going to go up and prices could go up somewhat short term, but prices will also go down. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=185.84s)]
*  Yeah, so administration officials have argued that tariffs are going to spur U.S. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=195.96s)]
*  manufacturing products made here and investment in the U.S. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=202.88s)]
*  But economists worry about costs being passed along to the consumer and even banking analysts. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=207.48s)]
*  They wrote this week that talking about or proceeding with reciprocal tariffs poses additional upside risks to the inflation outlook. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  Errol and Natalie, in our last few seconds, we know that mass firings are underway at federal agencies. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  Do we know which agencies are being hit hardest? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  So CBS News has been tracking this and we've learned that there have been department wide cuts at the Department of Education. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=232.72s)]
*  This is a department that obviously the president has talked about slashing or dismantling. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=242.8s)]
*  Really, what's in focus here is probationary employees who have maybe less than two years of experience. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=248.8s)]
*  The administration doge the Department of Government efficiency, feeling like those employees have less tenure, may have less legal ties. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=256.16s)]
*  So the union's really concerned about this group of employees and are reporting 40 or so, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=265.72s)]
*  at least what they had heard of yesterday of employees being impacted also at the Small Business Administration probationary employees there. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=273.24s)]
*  And earlier this week, we reported about cuts at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=283.72s)]
*  So, again, we're talking about newer employees, unions in a new statement say they're going to fight this, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=291.16s)]
*  say that the employees were not given notice or due process. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  We'll have to see whether this potentially triggers more legal action remains to be seen at this point. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=301.24s)]
*  Natalie Brand, across all the big headlines, we appreciate your reporting. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=308.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y3fz8ezro&t=311.36s)]
