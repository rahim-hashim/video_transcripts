# Why is Musk going to Trump's Cabinet meeting?
**CBS News:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8)
*  President Trump and his new cabinet will meet all together for the very first time in about an hour [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=0.0s)]
*  The meeting comes as the federal workforce has seen thousands of cuts and another mass layoff could be on the way [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=4.38s)]
*  CBS News White House reporter Aaron Navarro is live from Washington DC and joins me to preview this [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=10.82s)]
*  so Aaron [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=17.580000000000002s)]
*  Look, I've been around since the Carter years [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=19.34s)]
*  I mean I was around before that but not paying attention and I don't know if I've ever seen a [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=22.94s)]
*  Cabinet meeting where someone who's not in the cabin, especially for the very first one actually has a seat at the table [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=29.36s)]
*  How unprecedented is this? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=36.18s)]
*  Glad good to be with you. Yeah, what's really notable about this is not only well [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=38.72s)]
*  Elon Musk be present at this cabinet meeting [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=42.68s)]
*  but White House officials said this morning that a good chunk of this meeting could be talking about what they claim are [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=45.4s)]
*  waste fraud and abuse kind of the mission of those White House press secretary [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=52.4s)]
*  Caroline Levitt said that that would be a big topic of discussion amongst these cabinet secretaries for their first meeting now [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=56.9s)]
*  The first meeting is usually a chance for these newly appointed or confirmed [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=62.98s)]
*  Cabinet secretaries to talk about what they want to do with the certain agencies agriculture [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=68.53999999999999s)]
*  Secretary Brooke Rollins laid out the five-prong plan to combat the avian flu and the price of eggs [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=73.7s)]
*  That she said she would talk about during this cabinet meeting [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=80.86s)]
*  But Elon Musk being present there certainly shifts the conversation [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=83.44s)]
*  Towards how these cabinet secretaries have been interacting with him and President Trump posted this morning [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=86.92s)]
*  Saying that all cabinet secretaries love working with Elon Musk. Yeah, it's not just the price of eggs though [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=91.88s)]
*  As you know Aaron that's up price of beef is up measles are also up in the state of Texas [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=97.12s)]
*  So is there anything that you're hearing that's actually gonna get done? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=101.84s)]
*  Whereby these cabinet officials will address some of the more pressing issues that are facing Americans right at this moment [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=105.8s)]
*  Yeah, we're starting to hear from these cabinet secretaries as they're doing morning interviews [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=111.94s)]
*  But so far all we've heard at least from the public face of the White House is mainly on the Elon Musk's presence [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=116.02s)]
*  All right [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=122.10000000000001s)]
*  Let me ask you about this source that has told CBS News [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=122.74000000000001s)]
*  That there's a possible memo from the Office of Personnel Management and the Office of Management and Budget which will potentially order another [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=125.82000000000001s)]
*  Mass layoff of federal workers [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=133.26s)]
*  What do we know about this and it's gonna get to a point where we're not gonna have anybody working [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=135.42000000000002s)]
*  At the federal government [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=140.72s)]
*  Yeah [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=142.48s)]
*  This memo expected to come at some point today is going to direct agencies to prepare for large-scale firing sources [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=143.0s)]
*  I've told CBS News the guidance given to these government agencies to submit these quote [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=149.88s)]
*  reorganization plans by March 13 [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=155.6s)]
*  For quote huge reductions and force and this was something President Trump put out in the executive order a week or so ago [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=158.24s)]
*  Saying that federal agencies will have to work with Doge on this [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=164.68s)]
*  But it's certainly the latest step in the effort to cut down the federal workforce [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=168.88s)]
*  So while we have seen probationary employees let go we could see even bigger numbers in the coming weeks [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=172.85999999999999s)]
*  All right, Aaron Navarro for us in Washington, Aaron. Thank you very much [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPvg7yvKyN8&t=178.54s)]
