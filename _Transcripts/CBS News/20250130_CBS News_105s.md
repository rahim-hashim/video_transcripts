# Trump reacts to D.C. midair plane crash
**CBS News:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58)
*  For more on this response, let's bring in CBS News White House reporter Aaron Navarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=0.0s)]
*  Aaron, what is the latest we're hearing from the president and the White House this morning? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=4.36s)]
*  Well, we heard Secretary Duffy mention that President Trump is expected to be in the situation [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=8.88s)]
*  room at some point this morning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=14.84s)]
*  We have not seen any further statements from President Trump since last night. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=16.64s)]
*  But I also want to note what Caitlin mentioned earlier, that while the recovery efforts remain [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=20.72s)]
*  the priority as the investigation phase of this all begins, Secretary Duffy sided with [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=25.82s)]
*  President Trump in saying that this should have been prevented was quote preventable. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=31.8s)]
*  I thought that was notable in that press conference. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=35.94s)]
*  And help us understand the structure because we have the White House saying we're going [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=39.34s)]
*  to look into this. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=43.78s)]
*  You've got the Department of Transportation via the secretary there, Duffy, leading investigation, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=45.18s)]
*  the National Transportation Safety Board under his purview. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=51.06s)]
*  But you also have the Department of Defense because there was a military chopper involved [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=53.74s)]
*  as well. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=57.900000000000006s)]
*  Do we know who is in charge of all those various entities? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=58.900000000000006s)]
*  Yeah, certainly a lot of variables. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=62.58s)]
*  I will take from what we heard at that press conference. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=64.34s)]
*  The Washington, D.C., mayor noted that the National Transportation Safety Board will [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=67.86s)]
*  be leading the investigation. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=71.62s)]
*  I didn't hear Secretary Duffy necessarily disagree with that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=73.46000000000001s)]
*  The Defense Department will have their own potentially separate investigation as well, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=76.3s)]
*  given that this was a military plane. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=80.74s)]
*  And the role of the White House here is that President Trump will be in the situation room [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=83.14s)]
*  getting all the information as it's coming in. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=87.94s)]
*  It remains to be seen whether he will address the public today. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=90.25999999999999s)]
*  But certainly a lot of verified information will come from the White House as well. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=92.89999999999999s)]
*  Aaron Navarro giving us the latest there from our D.C. Bureau as we continue to search for [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=98.02s)]
*  details here. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=103.06s)]
*  Aaron, thank you. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxODSLrHA58&t=104.06s)]
