# Evacuation warnings issued for Los Angeles wildfire burn areas amid mudslide threat
**CBS News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4uXdmilXT0)
*  Another major storm system is threatening the West Coast with not just rain but mudslides and flooding. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4uXdmilXT0&t=0.0s)]
*  That is triggering new evacuation warnings in areas of California scorched by last month's wildfires. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4uXdmilXT0&t=6.3s)]
*  Now this atmospheric river is the second to hit the state in recent weeks. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4uXdmilXT0&t=13.5s)]
*  The National Weather Service says it will bring up to three inches of rain to much of the coast. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4uXdmilXT0&t=18.2s)]
*  CBS News national weather correspondent Rob Marciano joins us now from Altadena, California. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4uXdmilXT0&t=23.0s)]
*  It was ravaged by fires. Rob, I'm wondering what the main concerns are for people there today. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4uXdmilXT0&t=28.0s)]
*  Well, the main concerns are this rain is going to trigger mudslides basically and flash flooding. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4uXdmilXT0&t=35.9s)]
*  And this is the you mentioned the atmospheric rivers. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4uXdmilXT0&t=41.6s)]
*  We've had a few of them now, but this is the strongest one that's going to be targeted at Southern California. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4uXdmilXT0&t=43.8s)]
*  And it will come in furiously this afternoon, even though it's raining light to moderately right now and has been really all night long. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4uXdmilXT0&t=48.8s)]
*  You see what they're doing to prep here with this one particular homeowner, some some plastic, some drains hoping to keep this hillside in place [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4uXdmilXT0&t=54.7s)]
*  so that it doesn't slide and take the entire home with it up the road from this home and the rest of this neighborhood. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4uXdmilXT0&t=64.0s)]
*  All these homes have been burnt. So all this hillside is unstable. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4uXdmilXT0&t=69.8s)]
*  And sadly, this could all come tumbling down. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4uXdmilXT0&t=73.6s)]
*  And that's why a lot of these K rails have been set up to help hopefully redirect any sort of water or mudflow that may come down into the road. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4uXdmilXT0&t=76.0s)]
*  These K rails have been set up in a lot of spots, not just here in Altadena, but near the Malibu burn areas as well. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4uXdmilXT0&t=83.3s)]
*  They have a mandatory evacuation order in Malibu, steeper hillsides there. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4uXdmilXT0&t=89.0s)]
*  There's a whole lot going on here in Altadena. Most of this is voluntary. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4uXdmilXT0&t=94.2s)]
*  Although I think these folks there, they're not here wisely. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4uXdmilXT0&t=97.89999999999999s)]
*  So next 12 to 24 hours, Errol is going to be dicey as this rain increases. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4uXdmilXT0&t=101.1s)]
*  Yeah, people in Altadena and so many LA areas just have been through so much. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4uXdmilXT0&t=105.9s)]
*  Rob, we appreciate the report. Thank you. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4uXdmilXT0&t=110.2s)]
