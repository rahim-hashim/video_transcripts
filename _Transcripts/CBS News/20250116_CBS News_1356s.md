# Biden delivers farewell remarks at Department of Defense
**CBS News:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8)
*  I want to take you now to Joint Base, Meyer Henderson Hall, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=0.0s)]
*  where President Biden is delivering his final remarks [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=2.4s)]
*  as commander in chief for the U.S. military. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  To the Continental Army, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  still astonished by their victory and by their unity, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=10.52s)]
*  Washington asked, can I quote, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=14.72s)]
*  who that was not a witness could imagine, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=17.64s)]
*  the men who came from different parts of the continent, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=22.12s)]
*  would instantly become one patriotic band of brothers. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=25.56s)]
*  That's what you are, one patriotic band of brothers. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=30.52s)]
*  Vice President Harris, Jill, Doug, Secretary Austin, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=35.0s)]
*  Secretary Brown, two of the best decisions [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=38.8s)]
*  ever made in my career, I might add. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=41.4s)]
*  Service secretaries. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=44.4s)]
*  Members of Congress, and most importantly, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=46.2s)]
*  this patriotic band of service members before me, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=56.0s)]
*  serving as your commander in chief [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  has been the greatest honor of my life. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=62.92s)]
*  While I'm deeply grateful for your thanks and affection, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=67.12s)]
*  I'm here to thank you. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=71.56s)]
*  Thank you for your service to our nation [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=73.68s)]
*  and for allowing me to bear witness to your courage, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=76.44000000000001s)]
*  your commitment, your character. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  As I listened to the choir sing, I thought about it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=83.04s)]
*  You all represent what America is, character, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=88.36000000000001s)]
*  honesty, integrity, commitment. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=93.2s)]
*  Like Washington, it left me astonished, and I mean it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=96.08000000000001s)]
*  Over the years, I've frequently seen you [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=101.12s)]
*  in action in war zones in Bosnia, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=104.04s)]
*  Baghdad, Fallujah, Kabul, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=105.76s)]
*  I'm not going to bore the hell out of you, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=108.48s)]
*  but Helmand, Kandahar, and other places. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=111.0s)]
*  I remember one trip to Afghanistan as Vice President. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=115.64s)]
*  I was at a forward operating base in Wurundja Province, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  which is in eastern Afghanistan. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  I was asked by a commanding officer [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=126.16s)]
*  to pin a bronze star on a soldier [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=127.68s)]
*  for his heroism. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=130.23999999999998s)]
*  The soldier's teammate was hit while driving in a Humvee. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=132.44s)]
*  This soldier did everything possible [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=137.23999999999998s)]
*  to rescue his colleague from the burning flames. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=139.67999999999998s)]
*  When I went to pin the medal on him, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=144.16s)]
*  the soldier looked at me and said, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=146.76s)]
*  I don't want it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=148.64s)]
*  I don't want it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=150.6s)]
*  He died. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=152.32s)]
*  I don't want it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  In that moment, all they could think about [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  was the courage and incredible courage and humility [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=159.4s)]
*  and moral compass of this soldier had, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=164.16s)]
*  that all of you have. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=167.32s)]
*  This is not hyperbole. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=170.24s)]
*  You are simply the greatest fighting force [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=171.6s)]
*  in the history of the world. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  In the history of the world. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=177.0s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=178.56s)]
*  That's not hyperbole, that's a fact. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=179.4s)]
*  And there's never been a time in history [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=182.8s)]
*  when we've asked our military to do so many different things, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=189.44s)]
*  so many places, all at the same time. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=191.84s)]
*  And I want to be clear, you have done all, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=195.6s)]
*  all these missions with strength [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=199.24s)]
*  and maybe even importantly, with integrity. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  When I asked you to end our nation's longest war, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=206.04000000000002s)]
*  it rose to the occasion, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=209.36s)]
*  evacuating Americans, allies, and our Afghan partners, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=211.52s)]
*  accomplishing the largest airlift in military history, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=214.28s)]
*  and ending a war with the same courage [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=218.4s)]
*  as the fine American service in Afghanistan [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  for over 20 years. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=223.4s)]
*  I believe history will reflect those right thing to do, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=226.28s)]
*  but I know, I know it was hard. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=229.32000000000002s)]
*  After decades of losing your brothers and sisters, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=232.68s)]
*  including the withdrawal, the pain was still real. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=236.36s)]
*  And it was for me as well. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=243.88000000000002s)]
*  Every day I still carry, every single day, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=246.16s)]
*  it's my schedule. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=248.88s)]
*  On the back of the schedule, every single day, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=251.12s)]
*  at the top since I've been here, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=254.12s)]
*  says US, daily US troops in Afghanistan, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=256.76s)]
*  US troops have died in Afghanistan, 2,465, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=261.4s)]
*  not over 2,000, 2,465 troops wounded, 20,000, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=268.0s)]
*  769, and every day will honor their sacrifice [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=276.20000000000005s)]
*  for continuing the mission for which they gave their lives, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=284.20000000000005s)]
*  fighting terrorism, defending our homeland, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=289.0s)]
*  and protecting the American people. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=293.04s)]
*  Six months after that war ended, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=296.16s)]
*  when Russia began its largest war in Europe [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=299.24s)]
*  since World War II, I ask you to help defend Ukraine. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=301.48s)]
*  You didn't hesitate, you kept Ukraine in the fight, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=307.52000000000004s)]
*  trained Ukrainian soldiers and pilots, troops, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=312.6s)]
*  bolstered NATO's Eastern flank, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=316.56s)]
*  and above all, you showed the world [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=319.64000000000004s)]
*  America stands up for freedom, stands with our friends, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=323.40000000000003s)]
*  America stands strong with our allies. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=327.88s)]
*  We never bend down, we bend down to no one, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=331.16s)]
*  certainly not Putin. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=334.56s)]
*  And now, nearly three years later, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=336.8s)]
*  Putin has failed to take Kiev, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=340.24s)]
*  failed to make large territorial gains, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=343.04s)]
*  and failed to break NATO. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=346.04s)]
*  As a matter of fact, when I spoke to him on the phone, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=347.24s)]
*  I talked, he talked about he wanted us to be [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=351.32000000000005s)]
*  the Finland of Europe. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=354.0s)]
*  And I pointed out to him at the time for real, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=357.79999999999995s)]
*  as you're not only going to get the Finland of Europe, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  you're going to get the Finlandization. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=362.67999999999995s)]
*  Out of Europe, you're going to see Europe joining NATO, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=368.84s)]
*  Finland joining NATO, Sweden joining NATO. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  And America's watch, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=378.28s)]
*  dictators do not get to do whatever the hell they want. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=380.35999999999996s)]
*  And following Hamas' terrorism October 7th, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=384.08s)]
*  I asked you to, excuse my back by the way, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=387.96s)]
*  my mother would be very upset. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=392.88s)]
*  I asked you to deploy to the Middle East. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=396.52s)]
*  Again, you stepped up, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=399.72s)]
*  pulling long nights and long deployments to weaken Hamas, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=403.48s)]
*  to defend Israel against unprecedented attacks on Iran, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=409.4s)]
*  imagine had we not. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=414.56s)]
*  If we don't lead the world, who will lead the world? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=418.48s)]
*  Who? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=422.6s)]
*  Twice, you stood up to the attacks by the Houthis [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=424.16s)]
*  in the Red Sea. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=427.76s)]
*  Last year, I spoke with the women and men [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=429.48s)]
*  aboard the destroyer, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=432.0s)]
*  took down the first Houthi attacks. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=434.08s)]
*  It was the USS Carney. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=437.52s)]
*  And I want you to tell you all what I told them. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=440.2s)]
*  We owe you. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=443.88s)]
*  We owe you. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=445.6s)]
*  And back in May, yesterday I announced, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=448.52s)]
*  the proud announce of ceasefire, the Houthis deal [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=451.52s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=454.36s)]
*  The road to that deal was not easy. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=456.2s)]
*  It was eight months ago I laid down the elements [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=459.56s)]

*  endorsed overwhelmingly [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=470.0s)]
*  by the UN Security Council. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=472.72s)]
*  It's taken eight months, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=474.84000000000003s)]
*  a nonstop relentless effort from my administration [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=477.0s)]
*  to get it done. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=479.32s)]
*  But because of you, all of you standing behind me, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=480.72s)]
*  because of you, because of so many diplomats [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=484.92s)]
*  and defense professionals, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=487.68s)]
*  we kept the pressure on Hamas. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=489.68s)]
*  And we got it done. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=492.04s)]

*  you said, no problem. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=504.44s)]
*  You kept China in check. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=506.68s)]
*  Remember when we take off took office, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=507.88s)]
*  China was gonna overcome the United States, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=510.24s)]
*  economically and politically, by 2030. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=514.08s)]
*  Everybody wrote that, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=518.52s)]

*  with Japan and the Philippines. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=543.44s)]

*  It wasn't me. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=554.52s)]
*  It was America. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=556.72s)]
*  We did it. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=557.54s)]
*  That's what America does. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=559.0s)]
*  People know America's acting out of character. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=561.8s)]
*  Our nation is so much, and so many others, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=568.16s)]
*  our nation is asked so much, so many others as well. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=570.84s)]

*  to learn to walk again, eat again, speak again. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=578.36s)]
*  And National Guard members who dropped everything [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=583.04s)]
*  to help their fellow Americans during the fires [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=586.1s)]
*  and hurricanes. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=587.9200000000001s)]

*  Interpreters who make our missions possible. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=596.7s)]
*  Perhaps most importantly, your families. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=600.98s)]
*  They sacrifice so much. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=604.7800000000001s)]
*  And I might add, the doctors and nurses. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=607.62s)]
*  Excuse the point of personal privilege [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=612.88s)]
*  as I used to say in the Senate. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=614.5s)]
*  Came home one, I commuted every day. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=617.18s)]
*  Every single day over two million, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=621.36s)]
*  100,000 miles on Amtrak [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=622.8s)]
*  because I lost my family when I first got here. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=624.52s)]
*  My oldest son one day went home, he was attorney general. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=628.86s)]
*  He said, dad, what are you doing Friday? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=632.54s)]
*  So what do you want me to do? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=635.34s)]
*  He said, why don't you pin my bars on? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=636.18s)]
*  I said, what? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=637.42s)]
*  He said, you're married with two children. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=639.58s)]
*  He said, no dad, but someone's gotta go. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=641.7s)]
*  He spent a year in Iraq. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=645.22s)]
*  Won the Bronze Star Conflict of Service Medal. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=647.66s)]
*  But like many others, he was exposed to those burn pits [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=651.42s)]
*  which are within about half a mile of where he was bunked. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=656.58s)]
*  That stage four glioblastoma like so many other of our folks. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=662.9s)]
*  And I watched the nurses and the doctors [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=668.34s)]
*  who took care of him for so long. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=670.54s)]
*  And by the way, I want to take a moment [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=673.9s)]
*  to speak to all military spouses, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=676.34s)]
*  kids and parents here today. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=678.74s)]
*  Most Americans never see the sacrifices [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=681.06s)]
*  that you make every single day. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=684.14s)]
*  They'll never see all those holidays and birthdays [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=688.74s)]
*  with an empty seat at the dinner table [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=691.62s)]
*  because mom or dad are always at home. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=693.86s)]
*  Because mom or dad was deployed. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=697.3s)]
*  They'll never see all the moves you had to make [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=700.0999999999999s)]
*  to new states, to new schools, to new jobs. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=704.26s)]
*  But I see it and Jill saw it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=709.3399999999999s)]
*  She made it her life's work. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=712.74s)]
*  She's done everything big and small. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=715.2199999999999s)]
*  Helped the military spouses find childcare [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=718.66s)]
*  and build their own careers. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=721.5799999999999s)]
*  By hanging photos, employed moms and dads [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=723.98s)]
*  outside classrooms of those National Guard folks. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=727.46s)]
*  Because I know every holiday, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=732.3000000000001s)]
*  every time there's something going on, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=733.62s)]
*  their moms or dads weren't there, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=736.58s)]
*  but no one ever mentioned it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=738.82s)]
*  She started getting in every classroom in America [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=741.46s)]
*  to put up a picture of an employed mom or dad [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=743.62s)]
*  outside the classroom. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=748.3000000000001s)]
*  Even this morning, she held an event for joining forces [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=750.14s)]
*  and historic White House initiatives [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=754.5400000000001s)]
*  to support military and veterans families. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=756.0600000000001s)]
*  Because as a poet John Milton wrote, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=759.5s)]
*  they also serve, will only stand and wait. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=762.14s)]
*  They also serve, only stand and wait. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=766.7800000000001s)]
*  So for the last time as Commander in Chief, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=770.98s)]
*  I want to say thank you, thank you, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=772.82s)]
*  thank you to all the families we owe you. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=776.0600000000001s)]
*  I've long said as a nation, we have many obligations. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=779.86s)]
*  But I say we only have one truly sacred obligation. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=785.34s)]
*  That's to prepare those we send into harm's way [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=789.26s)]
*  and care for them and their families when they come home [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=792.26s)]
*  and when they don't. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=795.0600000000001s)]
*  Over the last four years, Common and I have worked [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=798.34s)]
*  to make good that obligation. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=800.6600000000001s)]
*  We passed more than 40 bipartisan laws to support you, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=803.5400000000001s)]
*  including something I felt so strongly about, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=806.1s)]
*  the passage of the PACT Act. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=812.62s)]
*  Drafted that law and we passed it. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=815.4200000000001s)]
*  Now it's already helped over one million service members [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=818.5s)]
*  and their survivors, their children, their access, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=821.62s)]
*  everything from college to healthcare. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=826.1800000000001s)]
*  These people were exposed to toxins. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=830.6600000000001s)]
*  In my generation to Agent Orange, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=833.42s)]
*  my son's generation to burn pits. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=836.42s)]
*  But we had to prove that what you had, what you diseased, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=841.02s)]
*  all the brain damage, all the brain cancers [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=845.78s)]
*  were a direct consequence of those toxins or Agent Orange. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=849.14s)]
*  But we changed that. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=857.3s)]
*  I wanna publicly thank the 9-11 Commission. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=859.9399999999999s)]
*  All those folks, all those firefighters [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=864.6999999999999s)]
*  were so badly, badly damaged because of the fumes [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=869.18s)]
*  and the toxins associated with the 9-11. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=875.78s)]
*  And those of you who are the Vietnam generation, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=883.38s)]
*  finally, all you had to prove is that stuff dropped on you [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=886.6999999999999s)]
*  and it didn't cause, they had to prove beyond [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=891.5s)]
*  the reasonable doubt it caused your disease [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=893.54s)]

*  We've invested over a trillion dollars [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=900.62s)]
*  in a defense industry base. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=904.38s)]

*  in any four-year period during the Cold War. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=910.78s)]
*  We also invested record resources [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=914.86s)]
*  to fight the scourge of military suicide. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=916.34s)]

*  he needs help, he can get an answer. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=924.86s)]
*  We fought veterans homelessness, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=929.58s)]
*  we brought veterans homelessness to record lows. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=930.74s)]
*  Made historic changes in the military justice system, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=936.3000000000001s)]
*  which has reduced the rates of sexual assault [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=940.22s)]
*  for the first time in nearly a decade. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=944.0200000000001s)]
*  We ended the ban on chandrenner service. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=947.86s)]
*  We took landmark steps to create more economic opportunities [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=950.82s)]
*  for military spouses. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=953.7800000000001s)]
*  We expanded opportunities for women in combat roles [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=955.82s)]
*  and I'm proud to have appointed the first woman [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=959.62s)]
*  as a service chief in the history of this country. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=961.62s)]
*  Clap for that folks because she deserves it. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=964.86s)]
*  I don't know about the rest of you guys, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=968.1s)]
*  but the women in my family are a hell of a lot smarter [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=978.9399999999999s)]
*  than the men in my family. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=981.14s)]
*  Look, if there's one thing I hope to take away [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=983.7s)]
*  from today, it's this. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=986.74s)]
*  This is not hyperbole, you're truly the finest fighting force [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=989.34s)]
*  in the history of the world. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=994.22s)]
*  That's not hyperbole, that's true. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=996.4599999999999s)]
*  Everything I and others have asked of you, you've done. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=999.4599999999999s)]
*  You've done with honor, commitment, grit and guts. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1003.18s)]
*  Let me close with a final request. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1009.6999999999999s)]
*  I say it not as your president or commander in chief, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1013.3399999999999s)]
*  I say it as a man who spent 50 years of his life [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1015.86s)]
*  serving his country in a different way. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1019.78s)]
*  Remember your oath. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1022.66s)]
*  My son, Major Beau Biden used to call it home base. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1025.14s)]
*  That's a set of principles of values [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1030.74s)]
*  that give you light and darkness that guide you. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1033.1000000000001s)]
*  It's true to the military, it's the best weapons, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1038.46s)]
*  the best training in the world. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1040.26s)]
*  We have the most cutting edge ships, planes and subs. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1042.7s)]
*  We have the smartest, most well-trained force on earth. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1046.94s)]
*  That's all critical. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1051.98s)]
*  But that alone is not what makes us strong. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1054.66s)]
*  This is not what brought Washington, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1058.7s)]
*  this band of brothers together all those years ago. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1062.3000000000002s)]
*  It's our values. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1066.94s)]
*  I mean it sincerely, it's our values, American values. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1068.18s)]
*  Our commitment to honor, to integrity, to unity, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1072.94s)]
*  to protecting and defending, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1077.94s)]
*  not a person or a party or a place, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1080.1000000000001s)]
*  but an idea, literally unlike a student of history, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1082.6200000000001s)]
*  I can say unlike any other in human history. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1086.06s)]
*  That idea is the United States of America [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1090.6200000000001s)]
*  is unique in the world. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1094.1000000000001s)]
*  Virtually every other nation in the world [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1096.74s)]
*  is based on geography and ethnicity or religion [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1099.54s)]
*  or some defining feature. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1103.78s)]
*  We're the only nation in the world, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1106.18s)]
*  only nation in history that built [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1109.18s)]
*  only nation in history built on an idea, an idea, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1111.18s)]
*  an idea that we're all created equal. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1117.3s)]
*  We know the words by heart. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1120.18s)]
*  We're endowed by our creator with certain and alienable [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1122.8999999999999s)]
*  rights among them, life, liberty, and the pursuit [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1125.06s)]
*  of happiness. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1128.42s)]
*  That's the idea that generations of service members [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1130.1399999999999s)]
*  have fought for, an idea you have sworn an oath to defend. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1132.54s)]
*  As a nation, we've never fully lived up to that idea, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1137.82s)]
*  but we've never, ever, ever walked away from it. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1142.86s)]
*  Our country's counting on you to ensure [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1146.74s)]
*  that that will always be true. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1149.98s)]
*  As I said when I began, 1% of you defend 99% of the people [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1152.22s)]
*  across this nation. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1158.06s)]
*  That's why you all deserve a special place in our hearts [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1160.6599999999999s)]
*  and in God's heart. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1163.8999999999999s)]
*  May God bless you all and may God protect our troops. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1165.18s)]
*  Thank you, thank you, thank you. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1170.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1171.58s)]
*  We've been watching President Biden speak [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1172.42s)]
*  for the final time as commander in chief [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1181.06s)]
*  before the Department of Defense, and he commended [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1182.66s)]
*  the courage and moral compass of members of the military, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1184.8600000000001s)]
*  called our military the greatest fighting force [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1187.26s)]
*  in the history of the world, commended them [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1189.46s)]
*  for training Ukrainian pilots and troops [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1191.3s)]
*  and showing the world America stands up for freedom [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1193.8999999999999s)]
*  and stands with our friends. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1196.06s)]
*  He said, quote, we've been to no one, certainly not Putin, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1197.6599999999999s)]
*  and he asked if we don't lead the world, who will? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1200.58s)]
*  CBS News senior White House correspondent, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1203.3799999999999s)]
*  Weijia Jiang joins us now for more on this. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1204.9399999999998s)]
*  Weijia, what were your takeaways? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1206.5s)]
*  Well, Lindsay, I think there was a lot of overlap [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1209.1s)]
*  between this speech to the military [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1211.34s)]
*  and his foreign policy speech that we've heard, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1213.54s)]
*  along with other bits and pieces, when he talks about [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1216.62s)]
*  that foreign policy and diplomacy [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1220.18s)]
*  and America's place on the world stage, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1222.54s)]
*  because obviously it is the Department of Defense [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1225.3400000000001s)]
*  and the U.S. military that is required to carry out [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1228.22s)]
*  any policy decisions that any administration makes [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1232.26s)]
*  when it comes to the troops being on the front lines, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1236.5800000000002s)]
*  to helping our allies, and I think he really punctuated that. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1241.02s)]
*  And really, this was just an opportunity [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1244.8600000000001s)]
*  for the president to say thank you [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1246.8600000000001s)]
*  and to express his sentiment toward the military [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1249.34s)]
*  and to use his personal story to really try to connect [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1253.9399999999998s)]
*  with these service members one more time [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1258.58s)]
*  and remind them that he is coming from a place [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1261.58s)]
*  as not only the commander-in-chief, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1264.02s)]
*  but also as a father of a military veteran [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1266.58s)]
*  who ultimately lost his life after serving. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1271.58s)]
*  And so, as we have seen many times with President Biden, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1275.34s)]
*  he weaves personal anecdotes into his speeches, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1279.06s)]
*  and this one was very touching because it was about his son, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1282.74s)]
*  Bo. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1286.98s)]
*  And so, I think we will see more speeches from the president, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1288.06s)]
*  at least two more, before he officially leaves office, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1291.62s)]
*  but this is a very critical one, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1295.3799999999999s)]
*  considering how much emphasis he has put on his work [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1298.22s)]
*  to really solidify America's place [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1302.34s)]
*  on the global stage again, Lindsay. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1304.62s)]
*  — And, Weijia, there was one moment [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1306.82s)]
*  where the president seemed to misspeak. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1307.8999999999999s)]
*  He was talking about, I believe, Ukraine and Finland and NATO. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1309.62s)]
*  I mean, did that strike you? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1313.34s)]
*  Were you kind of following what he was saying? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1315.02s)]
*  — I'm not exactly sure what part you're talking about, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1320.1399999999999s)]
*  but he did talk about bolstering NATO [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1322.3s)]
*  and the fact that Finland and Sweden joined under his watch [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1324.42s)]
*  because he had put so much effort into making sure [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1327.74s)]
*  that that defense group was stronger than ever before. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1331.78s)]
*  So, I have to go back and listen to see if I heard what you did, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1336.26s)]
*  but I know that that was a big piece of his presidency [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1340.18s)]
*  that he is proud of when it comes to defending Ukraine. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1345.14s)]
*  — Okay, I just had a hard time following that particular section, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1349.94s)]
*  but thank you so much for explaining that to us. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1352.1s)]
*  Weijia Jiang, appreciate you. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1353.62s)]
*  — Sure. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow1ozHWy_T8&t=1355.3799999999999s)]
