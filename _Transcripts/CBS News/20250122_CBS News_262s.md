# Why Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht, the founder of dark web market Silk Road
**CBS News:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848)
*  Vote for me on day one. I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=0.0s)]
*  He's already served 11 years. We're gonna get him home. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=8.22s)]
*  That was then candidate Donald Trump making a campaign promised at the Libertarian Party National Convention to pardon Silk Road [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=12.98s)]
*  founder Ross Ulbricht. In 2011 Ulbricht set up his website. On the dark web [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=20.94s)]
*  it was called Silk Road. It became a hub for people to sell lots of things among them drugs [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=26.58s)]
*  weapons and believe it or not [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=32.66s)]
*  murder for hire services. Now Ulbricht didn't do any of those things [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=34.66s)]
*  he just provided the place on the web in which those transactions often almost exclusively paid for in [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=38.54s)]
*  cryptocurrency could be transacted. In 2015 [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=45.739999999999995s)]
*  he received two life sentences which many in that Libertarian Party convention you just saw thought was excessive. The FBI [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=49.18s)]
*  once referred to Silk Road as quote the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the internet. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=56.86s)]
*  Technology reporter David Yaffe-Bellamy is covering Ulbricht for the New York Times and joins us now. David it's great to have you with us. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=64.9s)]
*  For those who are just catching on to this story had never really heard anything about Silk Road or Ross Ulbricht paint a picture for us. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=71.66s)]
*  Sure, so Ross Ulbricht was a kind of crucial figure in the early history of cryptocurrencies. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=80.38s)]
*  He created this platform where people could buy and sell drugs. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=85.92s)]
*  You could have drugs basically sent to you via the postal system and you would pay for it in Bitcoin which would keep those [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=89.8s)]
*  transactions anonymous. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=96.32s)]
*  Eventually he was caught and ended up with that double life sentence that you alluded to before. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=98.2s)]
*  And did this website and Ulbricht's involvement make him something akin to a folk hero among Libertarians or [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=103.24s)]
*  Libertarian inclined ideologues in this country? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=112.4s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=115.92s)]
*  Ross was a Libertarian himself. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=117.92s)]
*  He espoused Libertarian ideals and the project of the Silk Road sort of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=120.24s)]
*  corresponded with some of the ideas of the movement. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=125.88s)]
*  And so he was embraced by Libertarians, especially when he received a sentence that even many kind of neutral legal experts [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=128.56s)]
*  considered unusually harsh for what he did. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  And what did he actually do? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=137.8s)]
*  So that led to the sentencing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=141.04s)]
*  So what he was charged with doing was creating this platform where drugs were distributed over the internet. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=144.28s)]
*  And there were some other charges as well. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  There were also accusations that he solicited people to commit murders on his behalf. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=151.16000000000003s)]
*  He was never actually charged with that, though it did affect his sentence. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=157.12s)]
*  And there's no evidence that those murders were actually committed. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=161.24s)]
*  But that aspect of his behavior certainly had a major contribution on his public reputation and the sentence that he ultimately received. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=164.28000000000003s)]
*  And I know Libertarians believe, hey look, if people want to take drugs, it's their right. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=172.11999999999998s)]
*  But there were some significant harms that arose from transactions, drug transactions, on Silk Road, correct? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=176.44s)]
*  Absolutely. I mean the federal prosecutors attributed six deaths to drugs that were sold on Silk Road. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=185.76s)]
*  You had parents of those people, you know, speaking during the court proceedings about the effect that Silk Road had had on their lives. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=193.04s)]
*  I mean, he's a man who committed very serious crimes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=199.72s)]
*  There's no question about it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=202.8s)]
*  And what do you think this tells us, this pardon, about maybe the political popularity of Russ Ulbricht or the Libertarian movement? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=205.28s)]
*  Or is it more about an association from this new president returning to office and cryptocurrency itself? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=216.24s)]
*  I think it offers some major insights into how Trump operates. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  You know, if you can get close to him, you can advocate for this sort of stuff. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=228.6s)]
*  So in his announcement that he was issuing this pardon, he sort of thanked the Libertarians for voting for him. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=232.96s)]
*  So clearly it was a gesture to that movement. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=239.2s)]
*  And you know, this is something he promised to do on the campaign trail when he spoke at a Bitcoin conference and was trying to appeal to that constituency as well. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=241.88s)]
*  So it's a reflection of kind of two groups that he sort of allied himself with, you know, during his latest rise to power. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=249.88s)]
*  David Yaffe-Bellamy, The New York Times, thank you so very much. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgRIo7KA848&t=256.84s)]
