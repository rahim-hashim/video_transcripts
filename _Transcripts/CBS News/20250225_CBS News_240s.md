# Trump says Zelenskyy may visit D.C. to sign rare minerals deal
**CBS News:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE)
*  During his meeting with French leader Emmanuel Macron yesterday, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump said he will soon meet with Ukraine's President Zelensky [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=3.0s)]
*  to sign a deal on giving the U.S. access to the country's minerals. Listen. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=7.0s)]
*  I will be meeting with President Zelensky. In fact, he may come in this week or next week to sign the agreement. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=11.5s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Remy Inosentio is following this for us from London. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=19.0s)]
*  Remy, we know that Ukraine is mineral rich, but how much value is there? What are we talking about here? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=23.0s)]
*  Sure, Errol. Good to see you. Good morning. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=30.0s)]
*  Yeah, out of Europe's 44 countries, Europe, Ukraine is really one of the continent's most resource rich countries. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=32.0s)]
*  And we often call Ukraine the breadbasket of Europe, right? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=39.0s)]
*  But we could also call it something like Europe's own, what I want to say, mines of mortar, if you like Lord of the Rings, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=43.0s)]
*  vast wealth, vast riches, a lot of it on tap because of undeveloped infrastructure, lack of investment, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=50.0s)]
*  and of course, Russia's invasion. Titanium is one of Europe's biggest reserves in Ukraine here, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=57.0s)]
*  first or second, depending on what you look at. And here on this map, you can see that in blue. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=64.0s)]
*  You can see Kiev in the center part of the map there, starred on the Dnieper River. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=70.0s)]
*  Just to the west of it, you can see those massive titanium deposits there, strong, lightweight, used in aircraft and missiles. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=76.0s)]
*  Lithium, another one of Europe's largest reserves in Ukraine, estimated at about maybe half a million tons [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=84.0s)]
*  to the center of the country, to the east and to the southeast, notably in that yellow strip there, partly Russian controlled. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=91.0s)]
*  Lithium used in rechargeable batteries. You can think like EVs and laptops. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=99.0s)]
*  Graphite also in gray. 20 percent of global reserves is what Ukraine has. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=104.0s)]
*  When you think of graphite, you might think of the stuff in pencils that's true. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=109.0s)]
*  It's also used as industrial lubricant for motors. And then there are rare earths, so there's a swath there. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=113.0s)]
*  Half of that is under Russian control. But all of this hugely, hugely important in tech, airspace, defense, energy, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=119.0s)]
*  basically anything that is modern in our lives. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=125.0s)]
*  Yeah. And Remy, on that map, it showed that those rare earths and some of the lithium deposits are in the Russian occupied territory, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=128.0s)]
*  despite much of it being across Ukraine. I'm wondering why President Trump wants Ukraine's minerals specifically. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=135.0s)]
*  It's like toward the top of the things he says is a priority and where any potential deal with Ukraine and Washington stands at the moment. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=143.0s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah, Trump is basically putting this as payback for Washington's help over the past three years. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=151.0s)]
*  But there's also a national security aspect, not so much with Ukraine, Russia and the West, but with with China. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=160.0s)]
*  Basically, the U.S. relies on China for much of the world's rare earths and other minerals. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=168.0s)]
*  It's the biggest producer in the world. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=175.0s)]
*  Kyiv says that it is in the final stages of a deal, though, Errol. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=178.0s)]
*  And Ukraine's deputy prime minister says that the two sides are close. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=181.0s)]
*  Up on your screen here, you can see the numbers that people have been talking about. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=184.0s)]
*  Well, we don't know the exact details of any kind of deal. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=189.0s)]
*  Earlier, President Zelensky of Ukraine said that he would not sign a deal for five hundred billion dollars of minerals. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=191.0s)]
*  There you go on the top there. So that may be at least the top end of this deal. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=199.0s)]
*  Zelensky said he wouldn't put that to generations of Ukrainians to come. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=203.0s)]
*  But the next line there, three hundred fifty billion dollars, that's what Trump is saying. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=207.0s)]
*  Really, that's what he's claiming that the U.S. has given to help Ukraine. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=210.0s)]
*  But then there are intergovernmental agencies, Ukraine Oversight, that says that the U.S. has only given about one hundred eighty three billion dollars. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=214.0s)]
*  And so we're seeing at least the spread of potentially the spectrum of a deal that could come through potentially this week or next week. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=222.0s)]
*  Yeah. And of course, you need peace on the ground first before you can get to the investment in all those mineral sites. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=230.0s)]
*  Remy Inosentio with all the updates there. Thanks so much. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xclRuxtAhE&t=236.0s)]
