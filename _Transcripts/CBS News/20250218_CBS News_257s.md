# Mixed reactions among voters on Trump administration firing federal employees
**CBS News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4)
*  CBS News has learned that representatives from the Department of Government Efficiency, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=0.0s)]
*  or DOJ, attended meetings at the Pentagon on Friday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=5.0s)]
*  That is according to defense officials. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=8.56s)]
*  The Defense Department didn't say who attended those meetings. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=10.44s)]
*  DOJ is in the middle of streamlining the government as they look to cut multiple federal jobs. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=14.08s)]
*  We've also learned the Office of Personnel Management gave federal agencies until later [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=20.32s)]
*  tonight to issue layoffs. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  This whole reorganization of the federal government comes with a trickle-down effect. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=28.28s)]
*  So let's go to CBS News correspondent Natalie Brand. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=33.4s)]
*  Natalie, welcome. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=36.92s)]
*  Thank you for joining us today. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=37.92s)]
*  You talked to people in Virginia about the work that DOJ has been doing. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  What did those people who voted for Trump or against Trump, what did they have to say? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=43.56s)]
*  Yeah, Muko, good to be with you. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  I talked to more than a dozen people. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=51.64s)]
*  Many of them didn't want to go on camera. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=54.02s)]
*  They were nervous about that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  Everyone had a strong opinion ranging from fear to applauding the government-wide cuts. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=57.8s)]
*  To give you some background on where I went, I traveled to Ashburn, Virginia. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=65.16s)]
*  That's northern Virginia, but about 40 minutes outside of D.C. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  This is a place where you find a wide range of political views, but it's also a place [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=72.28s)]
*  that's heavily dependent on the federal government when it comes to people working for the federal [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=77.12s)]
*  government or maybe they are federal government contractors or they have businesses that support [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=82.46s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=88.86s)]
*  I met one woman, Carol, whose husband, she says, works for a company heavily dependent [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=90.13999999999999s)]
*  on USAID contracts. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=97.22s)]
*  She says because USAID is pretty much frozen right now, his projects shut down and around [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=99.89999999999999s)]
*  70% of staff at his company had to be furloughed. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=107.82s)]
*  That woman, Carol, and her friend, Janet, they shared with us some of their concerns [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=113.38s)]
*  about what's going on when it comes to government cuts led by DOGE, the Department of Government [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=118.05999999999999s)]
*  Efficiency, and Elon Musk. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=124.89999999999999s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=126.61999999999999s)]
*  Everything just feels very indiscriminately done. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=128.62s)]
*  There's no purpose to it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=131.45999999999998s)]
*  They're just slashing people without any kind of thoughtful consideration of what they do, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=134.3s)]
*  what their job is. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=140.70000000000002s)]
*  I just don't understand how all this can happen and there's no control over it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=141.82000000000002s)]
*  And we've got people in the Oval Office now that aren't politicians that have no right [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=147.14000000000001s)]
*  to be making these decisions. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=153.3s)]
*  Now the White House argues that it's the federal agencies that are making the decisions about [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=158.18s)]
*  who to cut. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=163.98s)]
*  Now I also spoke to supporters of President Trump who say that they're happy with these [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=165.61999999999998s)]
*  cuts and believe that this is long overdue, that government should be downsized, although [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=172.2s)]
*  one supporter said he did believe things were happening abruptly. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=177.7s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=182.26s)]
*  I think it was a little quick. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=184.78s)]
*  I think he probably could have rolled it out a little better, but I think overall it's [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=186.29999999999998s)]
*  going to be good in the long run. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=192.06s)]
*  I don't think it's too abrupt. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=194.26s)]
*  Unfortunately, we do have to pull the rug out after a while. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=196.22s)]
*  I mean, the spigot has got to stop. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=198.86s)]
*  This has just been ridiculous. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  Now one government employee who did not want to go on camera told me he thought that these [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=207.98s)]
*  cuts were fantastic. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=213.82s)]
*  to. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=216.98s)]
*  They're worried about the long term impact of a lot of younger talent, particularly these [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=217.57999999999998s)]
*  newer probationary employees that are getting cut. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=223.57999999999998s)]
*  They're worried about them leaving government and taking their skills with them, especially [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=226.98s)]
*  in high profile offices like CISA, the cyber agency. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=232.22s)]
*  So that's a concern. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=236.89999999999998s)]
*  And then, you know, critics of the Department of Government Efficiency, they've also told [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=237.98s)]
*  me that they feel like they're lawmakers, particularly Republicans are not doing enough [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=242.98s)]
*  to ask questions or push back. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=247.66s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=249.98s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Natalie Brand. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=250.98s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us on the stream today. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtVlDeZdPH4&t=253.38s)]
