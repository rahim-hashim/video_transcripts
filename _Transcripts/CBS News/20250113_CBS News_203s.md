# More details on Gabbard's paperwork problem delaying confirmation process
**CBS News:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc)
*  We're also watching for fireworks and former Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard's confirmation hearing. She's Trump's pick [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=0.0s)]
*  Of course, you'll remember for director of national intelligence. So let's bring in CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=5.32s)]
*  Nancy I want to ask you about something Senator John Barrasso said on face the nation you have information on what he calls a [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=11.92s)]
*  paperwork problem holding up Gabbard's confirmation hearing. What is this all about? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=18.88s)]
*  Right that was the first we had heard of it [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=24.64s)]
*  He said that there was a paperwork problem with the Office of Government Ethics [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=26.4s)]
*  Which meant that she probably could not have a hearing this week [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  So that pushes her hearing to next week at the earliest and what it means in practical terms is that [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=34.64s)]
*  President Trump is unlikely to have a director of national intelligence [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=40.64s)]
*  Sworn in on January 20th the same day that he is sworn in [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=45.44s)]
*  Which is something that presidents typically like to have because it is such a key [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=49.76s)]
*  Position in Tulsi Gabbard's case in particular read there are Democrats who have a number of concerns about her [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=54.64s)]
*  Democrats on the Intelligence [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  Committee which will be holding her confirmation hearing they say that she has relatively little intelligence experience [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=65.28s)]
*  They have concerns about some of her relationships with US adversaries [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=72.06s)]
*  They want to know why she went to Syria to meet with the deposed dictator Bashar Assad in [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=76.36s)]
*  2017 and so they say they are not willing to hold that hearing until they get all of her paperwork her background checks [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=82.36s)]
*  her [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=90.48s)]
*  Ethics disclosures and the like and because this is the Intelligence Committee read it tends to operate a little [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=91.56s)]
*  differently than the rest of Congress Congress is obviously [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=98.84s)]
*  famous for its gridlock [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=102.32s)]
*  Lots of acrimony, but because the Intelligence Committee the Senate Intelligence Committee deals with such [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  sensitive [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=110.56s)]
*  Information government secrets and the like they tend to collaborate pretty well [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=111.83999999999999s)]
*  And so if all the Democrats are putting their foot down saying they're not ready to go forward yet [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=116.28s)]
*  It looks like the Republicans are going to respect that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=119.96s)]
*  Fascinating okay, so another question for you inauguration day just days away any details on upcoming events for the Trump Vance team leading up to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=123.0s)]
*  the big day [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=129.88s)]
*  Yep, we're starting to get some information about how the president-elect plans to spend [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=132.28s)]
*  The few days before he is [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=137.76s)]
*  Inaugurated for a second time, and he's got a pretty full schedule [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=140.48s)]
*  What we have learned is that he's gonna hold a reception and fireworks show at his golf course in Sterling, Virginia [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=143.76s)]
*  On the Saturday before inauguration day, so that's this coming Saturday [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  So obviously he'll be leaving Palm Beach where he is right now and and flying up to DC [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=153.6s)]
*  He's also gonna lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=159.36s)]
*  National Cemetery on Sunday, and then this is a unique one as well read [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  He is going to hold a victory rally at the Capital One arena in the heart of Washington DC on Sunday [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=168.72s)]
*  Typically presidents tend to see the inauguration itself as the big rally [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  That's obviously the ultimate victory rally all of your supporters show up on the National Mall to cheer for you [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=180.72s)]
*  But this is a president who dearly loves a big rally and so that's what he's gonna get the day before he's sworn in [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=186.6s)]
*  Nancy it's good to talk to you always and it's nice to see it's balmy weather there in West Palm Beach [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=193.56s)]
*  Please go get a coffee seat though for me my friend. Thank you so much and have a happy Monday [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRPpeHYVbpc&t=198.51999999999998s)]
