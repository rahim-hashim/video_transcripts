# DeSantis says Tate brothers are not welcome in Florida after leaving Romania
**CBS News:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw)
*  Controversial influencers Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan touched just [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=0.0s)]
*  touchdown in Florida after spending the last two years detained in Romania for a [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=4.34s)]
*  sexual assault and sex trafficking case. This is new video of their arrival in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=9.66s)]
*  Fort Lauderdale after authorities lifted travel restrictions against the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=15.0s)]
*  brothers. Now it's not clear under what conditions they were allowed to leave [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=18.88s)]
*  Romania or their charges haven't been dropped. Our partners at CBS News Miami [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=23.34s)]
*  are following the story for us. Take a listen. The Tates have dual U. S. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=27.98s)]
*  British citizenship and have millions of followers online. And to give you some [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=32.26s)]
*  more background, as you might recall, we first reported that they were arrested [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  in late 2022 and formally indicted last year on charges. Officials say they took [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=40.64s)]
*  part in a criminal ring that lured women to Romania where they were sexually [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=46.900000000000006s)]
*  exploited. Andrew Tate was also charged with rape. They deny those allegations [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=52.379999999999995s)]
*  in December. We reported a court ruled that the case couldn't go to trial [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=57.46s)]
*  because of multiple legal and procedural irregularities on the part of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=61.620000000000005s)]
*  prosecutors. The case, however, remained open and there is still another [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=66.34s)]
*  ongoing investigation against them in Romania. Romania's anti organized crime [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=70.78s)]
*  agency has released a statement that says prosecutors approved the request [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=75.9s)]
*  to change the travel restrictions on the Tates but didn't say who made that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=80.58s)]
*  request. The brothers are still required to appear before authorities when [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=84.42s)]
*  summoned. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=88.89999999999999s)]
*  All right, let's go to BBC correspondent Nick Thorpe, who is in the capital of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=91.1s)]
*  Romania. Welcome, Nick. Great to be with you. Have Romanian officials said [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=94.38s)]
*  anything about why they lifted the Tates, the tape brothers travel [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=98.61999999999999s)]
*  restrictions because the charges have not been dropped. That's right. The [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=102.17999999999999s)]
*  charges are still in place. Um, the prosecutor, there was a rather terse [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=105.78s)]
*  statement from the Romanian prosecutors here this morning. So after the tapes [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=109.82s)]
*  had flown out on that private jet, which has now touched down in Florida, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=114.02s)]
*  in that statement, they said that the basically to the lawyers acting for the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=118.58s)]
*  tape brothers had asked for two things. One was for all charges against them [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=124.94s)]
*  to be dropped. That was rejected by prosecutors here in Romania. But the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=128.78s)]
*  second thing they'd asked, which was to have the right to get back their [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=133.94s)]
*  American passports and travel out of the country, that was granted. So in a [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=138.1s)]
*  nutshell, the situation we're in now is that they're still under what the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=143.62s)]
*  Romanian law calls judicial control, which means that they're expected to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=147.78s)]
*  collaborate to participate with that investigation and eventually, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=152.78s)]
*  presumably to stand trial here on here in Romania on those very serious charges. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=157.54000000000002s)]
*  But the prosecutors have now allowed them to travel back to the United States. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=162.94s)]
*  And can you go over the charges of the tape brothers are actually facing and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=168.3s)]
*  why they were in Romania in the first place? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=172.14s)]
*  Sure. The tape brothers first came to Romania, I think it was in 2016. They [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=175.66s)]
*  said then publicly that they felt free here to do what they like to pursue [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=181.05999999999997s)]
*  their business. And also part of that business was live online sex chats and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=186.05999999999997s)]
*  their allegations against them of, for example, of luring young women to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=192.77999999999997s)]
*  Romania and then coercing them into taking part in making basically online [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=199.7s)]
*  pornography that this amounts to trafficking. And they're also accused, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=205.45999999999998s)]
*  Andrew Tate is accused also of rape and also of money laundering and forming a [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=209.94s)]
*  criminal organisation. So basically, all these activities, which Andrew Tate [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=216.06s)]
*  felt he was free to do here, the Romanians turned around, the Romanian [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=222.5s)]
*  authorities turned around and said, No, this is a law abiding country. We [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=225.5s)]
*  don't want you doing these things here. These are criminal activities here as [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=229.58s)]
*  elsewhere. And that's what launched this sort of two more than two years of legal [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=233.66000000000003s)]
*  actions against them. It was very interesting. Andrew Tate in that brief [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=239.06s)]
*  exchange with reporters when he touched down after he touched down in Florida, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=244.86s)]
*  saying that there's no active indictment against him. You also mentioned here [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=249.9s)]
*  that this legal case, the judge basically returning the indictment to the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  prosecution and asking them to rewrite it. It's interesting here in Romania that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=260.62s)]
*  the rights of the defendants are very well developed, whereas the rights of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=265.21999999999997s)]
*  victims of crime are less well developed. And Andrew Tate's legal, Tristan Tate's [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=271.02s)]
*  legal team have been working very carefully on these procedural issues in [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=276.38s)]
*  order to build to this moment now where they've been allowed to leave the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=281.46000000000004s)]
*  country. And back here in the U. S. Where they just arrived, we know the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=285.46000000000004s)]
*  tape brothers have supported President Trump and their lawyer now works with [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=289.34000000000003s)]
*  the D. O. J. Is there any indication that their lawyer had anything to do [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=292.82s)]
*  with the travel restriction being lifted and then coming to Florida? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=297.22s)]
*  Clearly, there has been pressure, whatever we call it, from the Trump [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=301.86s)]
*  administration. We know that Richard Grenell, Donald Trump's special envoy, had [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=306.18s)]
*  conversations with the Romanian foreign minister in the corridors of the recent [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=312.14s)]
*  Munich Security Conference and raised the issue of the tapes. We also know there [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=316.18s)]
*  were private contacts. The Financial Times newspaper listed some of the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=321.09999999999997s)]
*  contacts between the U. S. Administration and the Romanian government. The [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=324.86s)]
*  Romanian government then denied that this amounted to a demand from the U. S. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=328.97999999999996s)]
*  Government. But as a key U. S. Ally here in Europe, a key NATO member, Romania [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=333.9s)]
*  clearly did feel under pressure and seem to have given into the pressure now, not [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=338.74s)]
*  withstanding the fact, of course, that the tapes say that they hope to be [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=344.18s)]
*  cleared one day by a Romanian port, and they seem to have given some in [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=348.14s)]
*  undertaking that we haven't seen anything in writing that they will return [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=352.18s)]
*  to Romania when they're requested to do so by the Romanian judges. Nick Thorpe [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=356.42s)]
*  from the BBC reporting to us live from Romania. Great to see you, Nick. Thank [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=362.18s)]
*  you so much. Or well, just a moment ago, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis spoke [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=366.18s)]
*  about the Tate brothers and press conference. He said they're quote not [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=370.09999999999997s)]
*  welcome in his state and doesn't know why they're there. Take a listen. We [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=374.06s)]
*  have no involvement in that. I read about it through the media. Clearly the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=379.26s)]
*  federal government has jurisdiction whether they want to rebuff his entry [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=383.34s)]
*  into the United States. And I have confidence that whether it's Pam Bondi [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=387.7s)]
*  or Kristi Noem that they will be looking at that. But the reality is is no, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=391.06s)]
*  Florida is not a place where you're welcome with that with those that that [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=395.5s)]
*  type of conduct in the air. And I don't know how it came to this. We were not [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=400.9s)]
*  involved. We were not notified. I found out through the media that this was [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=405.02s)]
*  something that was happening. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrF9Y_MGEw&t=408.9s)]
