# Egypt, Saudi Arabia reject Trump's Gaza plan
**CBS News:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ)
*  Egypt, Saudi Arabia and other allies in the Middle East are rejecting Trump's proposal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=0.0s)]
*  to take over Gaza and relocate the two million people already living there. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=5.2s)]
*  Palestinians themselves are also condemning the plan, saying their national and ethnic [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=10.4s)]
*  identity is rooted in the land. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  CBS News contributor Robert Berger has the latest from Jerusalem. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=17.36s)]
*  And Robert, thank you so much, first off, for joining us today. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=21.36s)]
*  The comments about the United States taking over the Gaza Strip, how does this affect [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=24.12s)]
*  the ceasefire deal? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=28.78s)]
*  That's the big question, because right now we're in the middle of the first phase of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=31.540000000000003s)]
*  the ceasefire. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=35.54s)]
*  That's a six week, 42 day ceasefire. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=36.54s)]
*  And negotiations on the second phase are only just beginning, actually due to begin around [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=40.02s)]
*  this weekend. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=45.44s)]
*  So the big question is, what is going to happen now that Trump came out with this bombshell [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=46.540000000000006s)]
*  proposal? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=53.86s)]
*  Will Hamas be willing to release the remaining hostages? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=55.7s)]
*  That's about 50 or so, 60 maybe, hostages dead and alive in that second phase if they [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=59.980000000000004s)]
*  feel that they have nothing to gain by this, if the end game is to throw them out of Gaza, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=67.48s)]
*  Hamas, and to displace around two million Palestinians. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=74.10000000000001s)]
*  So they may decide to hold on to the only leverage they have, which is the hostages. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=78.48s)]
*  And in that case, the ceasefire could collapse. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=83.5s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=86.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=87.1s)]
*  So I have to ask about authority here, because does the United States even have the power [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=88.1s)]
*  or authority to take over the Gaza Strip? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=92.3s)]
*  No, they wouldn't, certainly by international law. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=94.9s)]
*  I think Trump's idea is that this would be part of a broader peace agreement between [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=99.06s)]
*  Israel and the Arab world. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=105.78s)]
*  And then theoretically, the Arab world would maybe go along with Trump's plan to go into [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=108.42s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=115.54s)]
*  You know, but it's impossible, it's really virtually impossible to imagine that the Arab [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=116.54s)]
*  states would agree to that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=121.7s)]
*  It's possible that this is just an opening proposal, kind of like what Trump did with [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=123.34s)]
*  Mexico and Canada with the tariffs and then back down. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=130.26s)]
*  Maybe it's some kind of an opening proposal to leave some room for bargaining in his [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=134.94s)]
*  bigger vision of a Mideast peace. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=140.85999999999999s)]
*  And President Trump's proposal calls for Palestinians to resettle elsewhere. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=145.29999999999998s)]
*  Is that even possible when you consider that neighboring countries like Egypt, Jordan, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=149.7s)]
*  and even Saudi Arabia, they have said they do not want to be part of any resettlement? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=153.85999999999999s)]
*  So where would Palestinians go if this plan is actually put into action? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=158.94s)]
*  You know, Trump keeps doubling down when asked about the refusal of Egypt and Jordan to take [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=164.22s)]
*  in these Palestinians. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=171.42s)]
*  He says, oh, they will. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=173.54s)]
*  And he says it with some confidence. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=175.73999999999998s)]
*  Part of it's possible that he'll do some arm twisting with Jordan and Egypt, who are big [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=178.54s)]
*  recipients, especially Egypt, of US aid. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=183.98s)]
*  And then Trump has also said he believes other countries would be willing to take some of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=188.14s)]
*  these Palestinians. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=192.58s)]
*  It's hard to imagine it happening right now. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=194.54000000000002s)]
*  It'll be interesting to see when the King of Jordan, Abdullah, comes to the White House [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=197.38000000000002s)]
*  next week, how all of this plays out. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=203.06s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=205.62s)]
*  We'll wait and see. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=206.14000000000001s)]
*  Robert Berger, thank you so much for your time today. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=206.82000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c0v7z_SXQ&t=208.9s)]
