# Will Americans get $5,000 checks from DOGE savings like Trump, Musk claim?
**CBS News:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU)
*  President Trump says some of the money apparently saved by the Department of Government Efficiency's cost-cutting efforts could be given back to Americans as stimulus checks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=0.0s)]
*  Last week, Trump said the administration is considering giving 20% of DOGE savings to citizens. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=9.4s)]
*  We should also note a recent review by CBS News of what DOGE called a wall of receipts found that the initial accounting was overstated by billions of dollars. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=16.0s)]
*  For more on these potential stimulus checks, I'm joined by Jay Zygorsky. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=27.0s)]
*  He's an economist and a professor at Boston's University's Questrom School of Business. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=32.0s)]
*  Waking up early for us this morning and joining us, thanks so much. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=37.0s)]
*  I'm curious about if this would happen, which is a big if. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=41.0s)]
*  It wouldn't be the first time Americans have received checks from the government. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=45.0s)]
*  We all remember the stimulus checks. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=48.0s)]
*  But what impact could that have on the overall economy? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=50.0s)]
*  Wow, Errol. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=55.0s)]
*  And thanks for waking me up early this morning because I love talking about really silly economic ideas coming out of Washington. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=56.0s)]
*  And there seemed to be quite a boatload coming out from both the left and the right right now. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=62.0s)]
*  And let me say that I hope this doesn't actually happen, though it might. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=68.0s)]
*  You never know in the Trump administration. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=72.0s)]
*  And the first reason I hope it doesn't happen is that the savings are really doubtful. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=74.0s)]
*  Elon Musk is in charge of the Department of Government Efficiency and Elon has a long history of over promising and under delivering. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=79.0s)]
*  They initially stare out and they said we're going to find three trillion dollars worth of waste. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=87.0s)]
*  And then they cut it to two trillion. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=91.0s)]
*  And I'm just not even sure they even can come close to two trillion for a couple of reasons. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=93.0s)]
*  First, true savings are only known years later. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=98.0s)]
*  Give you a quick example. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=102.0s)]
*  About a week and a half ago, the president set out on true socially said, I'm going to kill off the penny. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=103.0s)]
*  We're not going to make any more pennies because we lose eighty four million dollars a year making pennies. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=108.0s)]
*  Well, that's going to shift everyone to nickels. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=113.0s)]
*  And right now we actually lose about almost 12 cents on making nickels. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=115.0s)]
*  So, yes, you might save money on the penny, but you might lose a lot more, making more nickels, which are more expensive. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=120.0s)]
*  I give you another quick one right now on the top of the Department of Government Efficiency's Web site. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=126.0s)]
*  They said we just saved a lot of money by canceling some leases in Miami for the State Department. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=131.0s)]
*  Well, if I was a renter, if I was renting space to the State Department and they just unilaterally cancel the lease on me, they broke the contract. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=137.0s)]
*  I might not be willing to rent to the State Department a few years down the line or any other government agencies burnt once, twice shy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=145.0s)]
*  So, Professor, it seems like what you're saying is even if this came to fruition, the exact numbers, the cost, the benefit wouldn't be realized for quite some time. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=152.0s)]
*  And so then I wonder if the purpose of this is perhaps something else. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=164.0s)]
*  Is this more of a sales pitch for the new president to demonstrate he's doing things in a different way and Americans will experience the benefit and it's less a specific promise to individual people? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=169.0s)]
*  I think this is a brilliant political move. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=183.0s)]
*  If you want to get the American people behind the Department of Government Efficiency, say we're going to give you a large check. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=185.0s)]
*  But from an economic point of view, it makes no sense for two more reasons. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=191.0s)]
*  The first is giving people large checks is going to cause inflation to go even higher. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=196.0s)]
*  You just had a segment on rising egg prices. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=202.0s)]
*  Well, when people get unexpected and unearned income, what do they do? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=205.0s)]
*  They spend it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=209.0s)]
*  And if we're going to have tariffs on imported goods, we're having supply constraints, more spending with less items means prices just go up. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=211.0s)]
*  So on one hand, the president hands people money and on the other hand, inflation takes that money away. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=221.0s)]
*  I don't know. Doesn't seem, Errol, to be a particularly good trade off in my mind. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=226.0s)]
*  You're the professor. We've got to trust what you say. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=231.0s)]
*  Jay Zagoski, thank you so much for joining us from Boston this morning. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StVP9vEyKBU&t=234.0s)]
