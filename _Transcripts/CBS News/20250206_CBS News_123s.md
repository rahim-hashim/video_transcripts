# Trump doubles down on Gaza takeover plan, says no U.S. soldiers would be needed
**CBS News:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85Ie7tpTDU)
*  New for you this morning, President Trump has taken to Truth Social just a few minutes ago to emphasize he means what he said when it comes to a U.S. plan for a takeover of Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85Ie7tpTDU&t=0.0s)]
*  He wrote, the enclave will be handed over to the U.S. by Israel once fighting has stopped, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85Ie7tpTDU&t=12.0s)]
*  and that the Palestinians in Gaza, he says, will be resettled in what he calls far safer and more beautiful communities in the region. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85Ie7tpTDU&t=18.0s)]
*  President Trump also claimed no U.S. troops would be needed to facilitate this plan. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85Ie7tpTDU&t=27.0s)]
*  Now the president's plan to have the U.S. take over the enclave, it sparked outrage from U.S. allies and adversaries around the world. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85Ie7tpTDU&t=32.0s)]
*  Our Chris Lissette brings us more now from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85Ie7tpTDU&t=40.0s)]
*  Well, Israelis and Palestinians alike are still picking their jaws up from the floor over Trump's vision to turn the Gaza Strip, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85Ie7tpTDU&t=43.0s)]
*  as he put it, into the Riviera of the Middle East and resettle the people who live there. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85Ie7tpTDU&t=51.0s)]
*  Now it sounds simple on paper. Gaza is destroyed, so to rebuild it, move the people. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85Ie7tpTDU&t=58.0s)]
*  But in practice, they number more than two million with memories of past displacements. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85Ie7tpTDU&t=63.0s)]
*  Israel's defense minister has praised Trump's once unthinkable proposal, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85Ie7tpTDU&t=69.0s)]
*  while emphasizing that Gazans should be allowed to leave voluntarily with exit options by land, sea and air under a plan he instructed the military to draft. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85Ie7tpTDU&t=74.0s)]
*  Average Israelis still traumatized by the Hamas terror attack of October 7th aren't quick to dismiss the proposal. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85Ie7tpTDU&t=84.0s)]
*  Today, Hamas still holds 79 hostages. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85Ie7tpTDU&t=92.0s)]
*  How Trump's vision for Gaza impacts their fate and the ceasefire is a question, like many, that haunts Israelis. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85Ie7tpTDU&t=96.0s)]
*  Now families of hostages, like most Israelis we spoke to, are torn. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85Ie7tpTDU&t=104.0s)]
*  They credit President Trump for pushing the release of the hostages in the latest ceasefire, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85Ie7tpTDU&t=109.0s)]
*  but worry how Hamas will respond if they think Gaza is about to be turned into a development project. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85Ie7tpTDU&t=114.0s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85Ie7tpTDU&t=120.0s)]
*  All right, Chris, thank you for that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85Ie7tpTDU&t=121.0s)]
