# World reacts to Israel-Hamas ceasefire, hostage release deal
**CBS News:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM)
*  I want to bring in CBS News foreign correspondent Remy Inosensio joining us live from Tel Aviv [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=0.0s)]
*  with more on the details of this deal. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=4.92s)]
*  Before we get to that, Remy, I want to just describe what you're seeing and hearing on [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=8.08s)]
*  the streets right now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=11.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=13.88s)]
*  Well, where we are, we're not hearing anything just on the edge of Tel Aviv. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  But what we can tell you is that, and from who I'm talking to via text messaging, is [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=20.26s)]
*  that there is happiness, there is relief. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=25.0s)]
*  I'm texting some families of hostage victims and they're saying that they are, quote, very [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=27.48s)]
*  excited for it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  Relief though, but also complications because in particular, one person I'm talking to is [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=35.64s)]
*  saying that their loved one, their younger brother, is not on this initial list of 33 [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  hostages that is expected to come out over now the next 42 days or so. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=47.8s)]
*  So this person says that they hate this deal, but at the same time that they're excited [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=52.84s)]
*  for the possibilities looking ahead. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=56.68s)]
*  As you would expect though, relief among people here in Israel hoping for this after the past [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  466 days of war. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=66.4s)]
*  But this has also been coming after 15 months of emotional anxiety, of hope that has been [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=69.48s)]
*  rising and that has been dashed ever since talks, negotiations have been happening ever [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=78.08s)]
*  since this past summer. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=84.98s)]
*  So you can imagine that a lot of people, even up until the moments before this deal was [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=87.17999999999999s)]
*  announced, there was cynicism. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=93.25999999999999s)]
*  In the past few days, we've been talking to loved ones, brothers, friends, mothers of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=96.22s)]
*  hostage victims, and they're saying that while they stay hopeful, they're also cynical that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=102.5s)]
*  this deal would collapse at the last minute. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=109.02s)]
*  They're also cynical about Hamas saying that they're just toying with their hearts and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=111.38s)]
*  with their hopes. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=116.5s)]
*  But now, finally, as we have been reporting, this deal has been announced and now over [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=117.5s)]
*  the next few days, we hope to see those optics that hostages will be starting to come out [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=124.14s)]
*  of Gaza. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=130.18s)]
*  And this deal still needs to make its way through the Israeli government. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=131.18s)]
*  But Rami, I want to get back to some of the terms. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=133.7s)]
*  33 hostages are expected to be released because of this ceasefire deal in exchange for thousands [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=135.98s)]
*  of Palestinian prisoners. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=141.7s)]
*  Of the hostages, we're hearing women, children, and older people. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=143.7s)]
*  Are you getting a list of some of the people that are expected to be released? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=148.42s)]
*  And is there any indication of whether these individuals are living or dead? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=152.57999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=159.38s)]
*  That has been an open question. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=160.38s)]
*  One of the sticking points, really, for Israel, asking, demanding Hamas to know who is alive [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  and who is dead on that list. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=169.08s)]
*  And to your first question, there has been a list that Hamas resurfaced over the past [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=171.32s)]
*  few days of 33 people. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  We're told that that list has actually existed ever since last summer during negotiations. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=179.44s)]
*  It has popped in and out and then Hamas did refloat this again. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  We're unsure, though, not made public is who is or how many people are alive, how many [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=189.56s)]
*  people are dead. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=194.04s)]
*  But according to Israeli intelligence, they believe that about a third of the people on [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=195.12s)]
*  that list are dead and that could be as high as half of them. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=201.16s)]
*  It's understood that possibly two of those people are also American citizens. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=206.0s)]
*  Also unsure, though, the state of them, whether they are alive or dead. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=211.7s)]
*  But all we know is that there are 33 people. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=215.44s)]
*  In terms of the mechanics of it, from what we understand, for every one living hostage [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=218.28s)]
*  that is released, it's understood that 30 Palestinian detainees would be released in [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=224.44s)]
*  exchange. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=231.32s)]
*  But for every one female Israeli soldier, male Israeli soldiers would be released in [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=232.92s)]
*  phase two. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=238.14s)]
*  But for female Israeli soldiers, it's understood that 50 detainees may be released for them. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=239.14s)]
*  So you can see that there's a difference in terms of the value of whether someone is [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=244.76s)]
*  considered a soldier or someone who is considered a civilian. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=249.6s)]
*  But Israel holds many, many Palestinian detainees, an estimated 11,000 or so, but they are demanding [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=253.64s)]
*  that they extract as many people as they can for these hostages that hopefully will be [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  coming out soon. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=264.8s)]
*  And, Remy, you mentioned in that special report that over the weekend the violence in that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=265.8s)]
*  area has really ramped up. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=270.21999999999997s)]
*  Several people have been killed, including journalists. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=273.0s)]
*  What more can you tell us about that? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=275.36s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=277.36s)]
*  In fact, over the past few weeks and in the ramp up in this past week, several hundred [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=278.36s)]
*  people, 600 to 700 people, at least have been killed since the start of the new year. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=286.04s)]
*  That number has risen close to 47,000 now just over the past two weeks. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=292.04s)]
*  And our CBS News crew in Gaza had been telling us when sunset fell over the course of the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=298.6s)]
*  past few evenings that they saw, heard or heard reports of intense bombing up and down [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=307.20000000000005s)]
*  the Strip. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=313.72s)]
*  The belief there is that Israel's military was trying to exert maximum pressure to, one, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=314.94s)]
*  the deal that we're now talking about to really put maximum pressure, maximum fear on Hamas [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=322.8s)]
*  and other Hamas-led militants. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  But in addition, there's the idea that in order to potentially get rid of as much of [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=332.72s)]
*  Hamas' militants' infrastructure as possible before that deal, before that ceasefire would [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=339.24s)]
*  actually take hold. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=346.0s)]
*  Yeah, we mentioned it's 400, over 400 days in this war. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=347.68s)]
*  Remy, can you give us some perspective on just the impact this war has had on the people [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  in Israel and Gaza and just the weight of this decision today? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=357.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=365.04s)]
*  I think for, you know, you're looking at scenes here right now in Gaza, and I believe that [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=365.54s)]
*  for both sides, for Israelis as well as Palestinians, that this is massively, massively psychologically [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  and emotionally scarring. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=379.44s)]
*  These can't be equated because it's a very different experience. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=382.29999999999995s)]
*  Here in Israel, it is the emotional torment, it is the emotional torture of families, mothers, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=387.2s)]
*  fathers, hoping, praying that their loved ones will come out of Gaza. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=395.2s)]
*  Again, looking at the destruction here in Gaza on your screens right now, much of the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=400.32s)]
*  Strip, especially the northern part of the Gaza Strip, has just been devastated. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=405.52s)]
*  It has been obliterated in Israel's quest, self-avowed quest, to destroy Hamas. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=412.08s)]
*  The question, the open question really is that when Gazans are able to return home to [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=421.0s)]
*  the north, what will they find? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=428.04s)]
*  And they might find nothing. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=430.84000000000003s)]
*  They will likely find almost nothing. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=433.6s)]
*  Ruins of where they lived, of their old neighborhoods, of the restaurants that they used to go to, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=436.0s)]
*  the beaches that they used to go to. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=441.40000000000003s)]
*  And the question also is that we are in the height of winter here, Liz. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=444.68s)]
*  There has been a dearth in food, in water, in medical supplies. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=449.96000000000004s)]
*  We know that under the ceasefire deal, those should be, will be surged, but it's almost [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=454.92s)]
*  unfathomable as to how much needs to be surged over what kind of timeframe to address the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=460.8s)]
*  scarcity, the lack. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=468.08000000000004s)]
*  And according to some reports, according to the United Nations, many people facing imminent [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=469.84000000000003s)]
*  famine that desperately, desperately needs to be addressed. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=475.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, the rebuilding effort is going to be massive. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=478.68s)]
*  And it's worth repeating what you just mentioned, that part of this agreement is that aid will [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=481.16s)]
*  be brought into Gaza. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=485.32000000000005s)]
*  But Remy, I just kind of want to go over the timeline of this. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=486.56s)]
*  It has to make its way, this deal has to make its way through the Israeli government. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=489.92s)]
*  But it sounds like the hostages, at least the first phase of the hostage release, could [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=493.6s)]
*  begin as soon as this weekend? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=497.74s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=500.40000000000003s)]
*  From what we're seeing, it could start on Saturday, likely Sunday, because it still [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=502.66s)]
*  has to work its way through the Knesset here in Israel to be approved by the parliament. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=508.24s)]
*  It looks like, it looks very much like this will pass the Israeli parliament, but there [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=514.96s)]
*  has been some domestic anger in the government as well as, you know, this is not a homogenous [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=519.46s)]
*  hope, a homogenous happiness rather, of this, of the ceasefire. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=527.96s)]
*  Many people here, thousands of people even demonstrated against this ceasefire. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=533.84s)]
*  That deal is expected to pass through the Knesset, and at which point we should start [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=538.72s)]
*  to see at least a trickle of hostages start to come out. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=543.8000000000001s)]
*  It's understood that the first batch of hostages could be perhaps three women, and then every [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=548.26s)]
*  week thereafter there could be three or four others who are released. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=556.2s)]
*  So for example, on day one, on day seven, on day 14, through this phase one, through [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=560.9s)]
*  42 days, and on the last day, it's estimated that about 14 of the final Israeli hostages [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=567.06s)]
*  in this batch, in this group, would be then freed. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=575.18s)]
*  Off of that, during that time, if things go well, Israel and Hamas, through negotiators, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=579.3s)]
*  would be, will be talking about the dynamics, the logistics of so-called phase two. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=586.42s)]
*  During that phase, that would then focus on the release of the other hostages, and these [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=591.9399999999999s)]
*  are the younger male hostages as well as male soldiers who are being released. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=595.6s)]
*  It's also going to focus on, as you talked about, as you talked about, the reconstruction [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=603.3199999999999s)]
*  of Gaza, which will take, not months, years likely, in addition, the governance of Gaza, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=607.26s)]
*  because Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Hamas cannot be reconstituted, cannot [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=615.5400000000001s)]
*  be trusted to come back to govern the Gaza Strip. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=621.14s)]
*  With that said, some parties, international parties, want the Palestinian Authority to [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=624.3000000000001s)]
*  come back to power, but also Israel's Prime Minister says he does not want that to happen. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=627.9s)]
*  So there again, it is an open question and a massive hurdle as to the future. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=631.82s)]
*  After the hostages are released in phase one and then in phase two, reconstruction and [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=637.1s)]
*  governance, this will take years. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=640.9s)]
*  Yes, no question. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=643.02s)]
*  All right, Ramio Innocencio, live for us from Tel Aviv. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=644.9399999999999s)]
*  Ramie, thank you so much for that. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gTjZP9ZjM&t=647.1s)]
