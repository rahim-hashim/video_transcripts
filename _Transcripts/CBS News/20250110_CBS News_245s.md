# Amid L.A. fires, some Pacific Palisades residents briefly return home to see what's left
**CBS News:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8)
*  I want to share with you kind of an impromptu situation that it's been developing here in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=0.0s)]
*  Pacific Palisades. This is at Temescal Canyon Road and Pacific Coast Highway. You see this group of [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=5.76s)]
*  people behind me here. These are residents. They're wondering whether their homes are still standing. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  They need medication. They're wondering whether their animals are stranded up in the neighborhoods. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=19.36s)]
*  They're wondering whether their homes are still standing. So they have shown up here. They have [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=25.44s)]
*  walked for miles, for hours to get here, and they've reached out to the LAPD and the port police, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  asking them to please take them up to their neighborhoods and let them see something. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=38.08s)]
*  That is happening. They are ushering people. They're taking them up in the patrol cars, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=44.8s)]
*  giving them five minutes to go inside if there's anything left. This couple here just came back. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=51.2s)]
*  This is what they managed to retrieve. Please tell me what this process is. How long you waited here? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=60.24s)]
*  Well, we came here with bikes and we know we couldn't get here through cars. My wife actually [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=67.6s)]
*  was so anxious that she walked here. I encouraged her not to come, but she did. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=74.0s)]
*  But then we got here and they checked to see if you actually live here with the cops before [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=78.24s)]
*  they let anybody in. And so we got escorted because we happened to be three of us in the same street. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  So they escorted us up there. And to be honest with you, I've never seen anything like that in my life. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=89.52s)]
*  You didn't know going in if there would be anything there? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely not. Not, well, I've seen it on TV, but in live is a different reality. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=98.32s)]
*  What was there? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=106.64s)]
*  My house sticking amongst many houses that were just destroyed. Destroyed. I get goosebumps just [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=108.96s)]
*  talking about it. And as I was saying earlier, I'm not sure the only happiness we have, I think, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=117.36s)]
*  in my love is to be able to even get our sentimental stuff out of there and some valuables. But [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=123.36s)]
*  everything around us is gone. And like I said, I don't know if I should be extremely happy or [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=129.6s)]
*  guilty feeling that everybody else's stuff is gone. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=136.16s)]
*  What did you take out? I see you have two bags here. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, I photographed, albums, documents, my computer stuff, my hard drive, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=142.72s)]
*  stuff that are extremely necessary. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=149.6s)]
*  The last time you saw that house was when? Tuesday? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, it was when? When was the two day? I've lost track of time at all the things. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=156.72s)]
*  Tuesday. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=161.12s)]
*  In the evening? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=161.68s)]
*  Well, we left in the afternoon. We left around 12, 1230, I think it was. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=162.96s)]
*  No, it was earlier. 1130. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  And your husband indicated that you were walking. Where did you walk from? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=170.24s)]
*  Well, we basically reached with a car to Santa Monica and then I walked from Santa Monica and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  he biked here. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=178.56s)]
*  Santa Monica Pier area. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=179.36s)]
*  So you walked for an hour or so to get here? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=180.56s)]
*  Well, she did. I biked. I didn't want her to come. She decided to walk here. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=183.28s)]
*  And you talked about the guilt and we've heard a lot about that today. People who are discovering [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=188.32s)]
*  that their houses do exist in the neighborhood and they say they almost feel guilty talking [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=194.64s)]
*  about it because there's so much heartache and so much pain. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=201.11999999999998s)]
*  You know, we love our neighbors. This community was and I hope it will one day become again a [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=205.11999999999998s)]
*  beautiful community. These people are wonderful neighbors. Our heart goes to all of them, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=213.04s)]
*  all their life, all their heart that they put in in their homes, all their memories are gone. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  You just said to me, you don't know, even though your house is standing, whether you want to be [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=226.39999999999998s)]
*  here because there isn't a place for you to have coffee anymore, to go to pray. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=231.28s)]
*  There's nothing. They're just, it's just destroyed. It's a disaster. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=236.39999999999998s)]
*  It's Armageddon. I've never seen anything like this in my life. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F7sWIDQPc8&t=240.24s)]
