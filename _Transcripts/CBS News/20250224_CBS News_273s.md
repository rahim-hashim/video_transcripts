# Trump meeting with France's Macron at the White House
**CBS News:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk)
*  As world leaders meet in Kiev today, French President Emmanuel Macron is meeting with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump at the White House at this moment. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=4.0s)]
*  And the meeting comes after European powers were excluded from peace deal talks last week, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=7.16s)]
*  you may remember. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=12.32s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Natalie Brand joins us now from the White House with more on this. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=13.32s)]
*  And Natalie, we for a while heard President Trump say he'd be able to end the war in Ukraine [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=17.6s)]
*  quickly. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=22.2s)]
*  But how are we any closer to that happening today? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=23.6s)]
*  Yeah, Errol, good to be with you. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=28.52s)]
*  Well, we heard from Secretary of State Marco Rubio last week, the president's secretary [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  of state, that really whether or not Russia is serious about ending this conflict remains [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=35.68s)]
*  to be seen. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  We'll see in the coming weeks. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  And as you noted, high-level meetings today between President Trump and the French president, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=46.44s)]
*  they're on a leadership call with G7 leaders right now, which is still underway. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=52.08s)]
*  The French president here right now, as part of this push by European leaders to make sure [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=57.16s)]
*  that they and Ukraine are at the negotiating table and that Ukraine's interests are taken [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=63.559999999999995s)]
*  fully into account, as well, of course, as its security. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=70.32s)]
*  There has been concern expressed by European allies that these talks between the U.S. and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=74.92s)]
*  Russia could lead to a less favorable outcome for Ukraine. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=81.08s)]
*  So obviously, European allies who are concerned about Europe's larger safety here to try to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=86.52s)]
*  make that case today, the Trump administration and the president, for that matter, stress [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=93.32s)]
*  that the U.S. is talking to not only Russia, but its European allies and Ukraine as well. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  And we heard from the French president that he, of course, is advocating for Ukraine to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=105.96s)]
*  be a part of whatever discussions happen to bring peace and create a next phase. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=111.32s)]
*  And we know that President Trump is meeting with other world leaders this week. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  I'm curious what Trump wants from them or what he wants to accomplish from these other meetings. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=119.56s)]
*  Right. As you noted, the British prime minister will be coming here later this week. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  The French president here now, we're very eager to see what he has to say following this [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=131.36s)]
*  initial meeting with the president. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=136.8s)]
*  We know that they will have a joint news conference later today. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=138.96s)]
*  So all ears will be attuned to what happens there. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=142.6s)]
*  But we know that the U.S., the Trump administration, has been pushing Ukraine to try to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=145.36s)]
*  give the U.S. access to some rare earth minerals as part of this larger negotiation. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=151.24s)]
*  We know that the president has repeated that point on multiple occasions, including over the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=157.8s)]
*  weekend, speaking about this conflict during CPAC, during his remarks there. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  So we know that that is likely to be part of these talks again, as the president tries to put [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  pressure on both sides to end the war that Russia started three years ago. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=176.83999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think we do expect a press conference between the U.S. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  and French president at approximately 2 p.m. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  Eastern. So we'll see what gets answered there. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=187.39999999999998s)]
*  You and I were speaking earlier this morning on the CBS Morning News about these doge cuts to so [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=189.88s)]
*  many agencies telling people to reply with what they've been up to. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=195.04s)]
*  Otherwise, they will be considered resigning. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=199.12s)]
*  But some agencies telling their staff not to comply. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=201.76s)]
*  Fill us in on that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=204.48s)]
*  Yeah, we're seeing some really interesting and notable pushback from some of the agency head [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=206.32s)]
*  secretaries of these departments saying don't respond to that email, that there's a process [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=212.48s)]
*  internally at these departments for employee reviews and that it shouldn't be coming from the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=218.88s)]
*  Office of Personnel Management. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=224.84s)]
*  Among some of the agencies that were pushing back the president's own newly confirmed FBI [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=227.48s)]
*  director, Kash Patel, as well as the Department of Defense and the State Department, again, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=234.12s)]
*  telling employees not to respond to that email listing five or so accomplishments over the past [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=240.04s)]
*  week. Some labor employment attorneys have also said that those emails may not even be legal. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=246.2s)]
*  So already heading into this new week, we are seeing a notable pushback by some of these [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=252.52s)]
*  departments as the Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, continue to look [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=258.52s)]
*  for ways to make cuts to the federal workforce. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=263.88s)]
*  All right, Natalie Brand with all the latest for us from the White House. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=268.44s)]
*  Natalie, thank you very much. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYtl4rRGSSk&t=271.24s)]
