# Vatican provides update on Pope Francis' critical condition
**CBS News:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE)
*  All right, we are following breaking news out of Rome where we are getting an [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=0.0s)]
*  update on the health of Pope Francis. At last word, the 88 year old pontiff [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=3.18s)]
*  remains critical but stable 11 days after being hospitalized for pneumonia [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=8.38s)]
*  in both lungs. CBS News senior foreign correspondent set down joins us live [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=13.82s)]
*  from Rome. Seth, thank you for being with us. What's the latest on Pope [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=18.04s)]
*  Francis? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=21.54s)]
*  Well, as you mentioned, Liz critical but is in critical condition, but stable. A [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=22.82s)]
*  few more details. No acute respiratory crisis we had heard over the weekend. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=28.939999999999998s)]
*  Of course, he had had that prolonged respiratory crisis. That was something [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=33.46s)]
*  that he has not had since the weekend. His blood parameters are stable in the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=37.14s)]
*  evening. Had a scheduled CAT scan to look at the at the issues in his lungs. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=42.5s)]
*  Of course, he has, um, uh, pneumonia in both lungs. We had a CAT scan to take a [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=49.14s)]
*  look at that. No, no results of that that were released by the Vatican [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=53.86s)]
*  tonight, but he did have that CAT scan. One noteworthy thing to say he's still [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=58.3s)]
*  not being given a prognosis by his doctors. And that's interesting that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=62.18s)]
*  he is in critical condition and his doctors have told us from Friday right [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=66.42s)]
*  along. They are not willing to say or not able to say things could go either [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=70.82s)]
*  way. You could get better or worse, but I would say this is a relatively at least [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=76.22s)]
*  not discouraging update. Sometimes we get much more grim updates that we start [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=82.53999999999999s)]
*  hearing about new things. I was asking Dr John LaPuke what he would be [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=87.9s)]
*  listening for. And one of the things he said was for new things to pop up for us [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=91.3s)]
*  to start hearing what we heard on Sunday night of concerns of early kidney [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=95.53999999999999s)]
*  kidney failure, things like that. So nothing that stands out in this, but, uh, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=103.38s)]
*  not saying things are he's in the clear for sure. Sure. Another kind of it [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=109.05999999999999s)]
*  sounds like encouraging element to this set this despite his condition, Pope [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=114.05999999999999s)]
*  Francis was still able to perform some of his official Vatican duties from the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=118.46s)]
*  hospital. What can you tell us about that? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=122.58s)]
*  Yeah, we know that we met with Cardinal Perrine, the number two, the secretary of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=125.89999999999999s)]
*  state and his deputy. We know he started the process towards sainthood for five [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=130.38s)]
*  different candidates. The Catholic Church has been sending out messages [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=135.38s)]
*  saying the pope is working every day. We get these bulletins that describe when [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=139.9s)]
*  different people are nominated to different posts and archbishop here or [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=144.86s)]
*  there, and they've continued to send those out really slowly and slowly. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=149.02s)]
*  Send those out really saying all along. And in fact, in tonight's report also [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=153.54s)]
*  mentioning that the pope had resumed his work activities. There is an effort [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=158.78s)]
*  to show for obviously that health of the pope, but also the health of the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=161.94s)]
*  church that the that the pope is still working and that the affairs of the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=166.1s)]
*  church move forward. All right, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Seth [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=169.62s)]
*  Don't live for us from Rome. Thank you so much, Seth. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdkVNdn1WE&t=173.7s)]
