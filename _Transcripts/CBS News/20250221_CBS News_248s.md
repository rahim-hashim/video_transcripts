# Latest news on Trump administration's mass layoffs
**CBS News:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ)
*  Thousands of Americans are now out of work and the cuts are still coming. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=0.0s)]
*  A federal judge is allowing President Trump's mass layoffs to press forward while legal [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=3.72s)]
*  proceedings continue. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=8.92s)]
*  More than 6,000 people working at the Internal Revenue Service were set to be let go before [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=10.92s)]
*  the week's end. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=15.94s)]
*  The layoffs come in the middle of tax filing period, but an email sent to IRS managers [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=17.36s)]
*  and obtained by CBS News says the employees terminated were not deemed as critical to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=21.6s)]
*  the filing season. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=26.76s)]
*  Now the president is reportedly considering a move to take over the U.S. Postal Service [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=28.66s)]
*  and absorb the independent mail agency into his administration. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=32.82s)]
*  Elon Musk celebrated the cost-cutting yesterday at the Conservative Political Action Conference [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  by raising a chainsaw. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=42.06s)]
*  His Department of Government Efficiency Office has helped axe at least 12,000 jobs so far [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=44.4s)]
*  in the first month of President Trump's second term. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=49.379999999999995s)]
*  Musk says additional cuts are expected across parts of government in the days and weeks [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=52.3s)]
*  ahead. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=56.54s)]
*  In the CBS News White House reporter Willie James Inman, Willie, our CBS News data team [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=57.54s)]
*  found more than half a million federal workers have less than two years on the job and could [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=61.74s)]
*  be considered probationary. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=65.84s)]
*  We know that probationary workers have been on the chopping block, but the administration [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=68.34s)]
*  can only use the reasoning of misconduct or poor performance to fire them. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=71.68s)]
*  So is that going to be problematic for Doge to continue with these cuts and what agencies [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=75.84s)]
*  could be next? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=80.36s)]
*  Hey there, Lindsay. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=81.36s)]
*  Good to be with you this afternoon. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=82.36s)]
*  The White House is saying that this is part of a downsizing effort. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=84.98s)]
*  In fact, Kevin Hassett, the top economic adviser to the president, essentially talked about, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=87.54s)]
*  was asked about these probationary employees by our own Nancy Quartus and he essentially [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=93.10000000000001s)]
*  said that he hasn't really seen a probationary employee talk about how their performance [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=98.06s)]
*  was good even if their performance had been bad and they had been let go. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=103.42s)]
*  So one of the reasonings behind this in part is to not only downsize the federal government, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=108.48s)]
*  but Hassett noted that really these employees haven't been at full performance, either they're [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=114.14s)]
*  not showing up to these abandoned buildings that Trump has talked about and other officials [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  have been talking about essentially that these buildings aren't full with these workers. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=124.0s)]
*  And the White House continuing with this push, as you mentioned, some 6000 IRS employees, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  The administration says that these employees aren't necessarily those employees that are [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=134.72s)]
*  processing the tax returns. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=139.12s)]
*  They're not mission critical to following those taxes or receiving those tax returns [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=140.96s)]
*  from millions of Americans across this country. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=145.26s)]
*  But still nonetheless, they're pushing forward with this, not necessarily waiting for the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=148.2s)]
*  courts to weigh in, although we could potentially see some pushback, some legal pushback from [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=152.72s)]
*  some of these employees following challenges to their firings, Lindsay. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=158.84s)]
*  Willie, on Capitol Hill, we have the Senate adopting their own GOP budget plan. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=163.52s)]
*  The president has endorsed the House GOP budget plan. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=168.20000000000002s)]
*  How are they different? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=171.62s)]
*  And is the president reacting to what the Senate did last night? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=172.62s)]
*  Yeah, we were talking about this, if not, I'm not mistaken, a day or so ago. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=175.52s)]
*  And really, this development is moving quite fast with the Senate passing its legislation [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=181.52s)]
*  largely based on the president's priorities, pumping money into the Department of Homeland [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  Security to push back against illegal migration. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=191.54s)]
*  That's a major priority for the president. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=194.86s)]
*  But also on the House side, you have some cuts. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=198.7s)]
*  Now, that bill isn't going to be voted on until next week. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=200.78s)]
*  Some cuts that would largely target Medicaid, about 800 or so million dollars. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=204.22s)]
*  Now, this is a multibillion dollar program. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=210.02s)]
*  And the president said earlier in the week that Medicaid, Social Security, Medicare would [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=212.78s)]
*  not be touched in a Fox News interview. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=218.06s)]
*  But as you mentioned, he did endorse this House plan. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=220.78s)]
*  So it's unclear what will happen there. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=224.45999999999998s)]
*  Both sides have to come together to eventually come to some type of consensus to move that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=227.01999999999998s)]
*  legislation forward, to push forward the president's agenda. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=231.89999999999998s)]
*  So not a done deal quite yet, but still nonetheless a significant step in moving that process [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=235.14s)]
*  forward with the Senate voting on its priorities with that legislation, Lindsay. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=241.1s)]
*  Willie, James Inman, thank you. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhwZLjTzUQ&t=245.54s)]
