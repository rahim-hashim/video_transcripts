# Snow storm pummels southern U.S.
**CBS News:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE)
*  A winter storm is dropping ice and snow across large swaths of the south right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=0.0s)]
*  In Memphis, Tennessee, driving conditions are slow as the roads there are just coated [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=5.14s)]
*  with slush. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=9.26s)]
*  Over in Atlanta, more than 600 flights have been canceled and hundreds more delayed due [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=10.46s)]
*  to the snow there. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=14.8s)]
*  And in Wichita, Kansas, at the bottom of your screen, snowflakes are blanketing communities [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=16.38s)]
*  with more expected into the evening. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=20.82s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Jason Allen has the latest from Fort Worth, Texas. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=24.02s)]
*  The first major winter storm of this season now moving out of Texas after dropping this [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=29.54s)]
*  cold cold mix of snow and ice and sleet and a very cold rain onto the area. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=34.28s)]
*  The Dallas-Fort Worth area is on the spot with this storm where one degree made all [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=39.76s)]
*  the difference. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=44.3s)]
*  You look at some of the grassy surfaces that are back here along the highway, you'll see [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=45.3s)]
*  maybe an inch, inch and a half to two inches. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  But it is not that far to the northeast where the snow piled up as much as six, eight, ten [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=51.2s)]
*  inches, even more in some locations. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=56.64s)]
*  You see the highway, the traffic moving clearly back here behind me, people getting out on [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=59.6s)]
*  the roads, even though many of the schools and the government offices are closed today [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=63.94s)]
*  because there was real concern about just what the roadways are going to look like. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=67.82s)]
*  And there's a very big difference in some of these roadways. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=72.08s)]
*  On the highways, things are clear. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=74.72s)]
*  You get up here onto these raised surfaces where there's no insulating ground underneath. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=76.4s)]
*  That's where you'll still find this snowy, slushy mix. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=81.2s)]
*  It's like this on these raised surfaces, also like this in a lot of neighborhoods around [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=84.6s)]
*  the area. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=88.64s)]
*  There's been some concern, obviously, with the cotton ball that is being played tonight, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=89.64s)]
*  just about 10 miles or so to our east. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=93.16s)]
*  But it looks like people are going to have no problems getting out on the highways. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=95.89999999999999s)]
*  There may be some trouble with people flying into the area if they're still doing that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=100.28s)]
*  today. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=103.6s)]
*  Still hundreds of flights canceled out at DFW Airport because of that storm that lasted [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=104.6s)]
*  for most of yesterday and through last night. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=112.72s)]
*  I'm Drayton Allen. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=113.72s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAfvAKMU3NE&t=114.72s)]
