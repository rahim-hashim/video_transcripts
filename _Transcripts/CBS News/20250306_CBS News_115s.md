# Vatican releases first audio of Pope Francis after being hospitalized
**CBS News:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SzsHv4KBFk)
*  We are hearing from Pope Francis for the first time since he was hospitalized. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SzsHv4KBFk&t=0.0s)]
*  That's an audio recording of the Pope being played during a nightly prayer [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SzsHv4KBFk&t=20.88s)]
*  service in St. Peter's Square today. In Spanish, he said, quote, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SzsHv4KBFk&t=24.96s)]
*  I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your prayers for my health from the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SzsHv4KBFk&t=28.6s)]
*  square. I accompany you from here. CBS News foreign correspondent Chris [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SzsHv4KBFk&t=32.36s)]
*  Livesey has the latest on the pope's health as he continues treatment for [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SzsHv4KBFk&t=36.96s)]
*  double pneumonia. Well, it's an encouraging sign to hear Pope Francis [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SzsHv4KBFk&t=39.78s)]
*  expressing his gratitude for the people who have been praying for him [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SzsHv4KBFk&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  specifically right behind me in St. Peter's Square. It's the first time [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SzsHv4KBFk&t=47.72s)]
*  we've heard from Pope Francis since he was hospitalized. But of course, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SzsHv4KBFk&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  it's also a reflection of the toll that this illness has taken on him. You can [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SzsHv4KBFk&t=57.14s)]
*  hear the frailty in his voice after spending three weeks in the hospital [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SzsHv4KBFk&t=61.9s)]
*  for what started out as a bad case of bronchitis and has since devolved into [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SzsHv4KBFk&t=66.46000000000001s)]
*  double pneumonia. Now, earlier today we heard from Vatican sources who talked [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SzsHv4KBFk&t=71.74000000000001s)]
*  about how Francis remains in stable condition and how he hasn't suffered [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SzsHv4KBFk&t=76.54s)]
*  from any more instances of that acute respiratory insufficiency that he [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SzsHv4KBFk&t=81.46000000000001s)]
*  suffered from earlier this week when doctors had to intervene and aspirate [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SzsHv4KBFk&t=86.3s)]
*  mucus from his air passageways, reflecting the transparency that has [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SzsHv4KBFk&t=91.02s)]
*  marked this hospitalization, which we're hearing again in this audio [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SzsHv4KBFk&t=95.86s)]
*  message that he has shared with the world that's rather unprecedented for [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SzsHv4KBFk&t=100.25999999999999s)]
*  the Vatican, who usually keeps a very tight lid on the health of a pope, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SzsHv4KBFk&t=105.74s)]
*  especially when a pope is in the hospital. Chris Livesey, CBS News, Rome. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SzsHv4KBFk&t=109.62s)]
