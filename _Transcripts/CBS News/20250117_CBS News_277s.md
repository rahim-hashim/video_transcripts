# Trump moves inauguration indoors due to severe weather in D.C.
**CBS News:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk)
*  CBS News congressional correspondent Scott McFarland joins us now from Capitol Hill. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=0.0s)]
*  Before we get to that Scott, I want to get to this breaking news that the Trump inauguration [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=4.38s)]
*  could possibly be moved indoors we're hearing because of the weather. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=8.38s)]
*  What are you hearing about that? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=12.8s)]
*  The president-elect removed the mystery and the intrigue he announced on his social media [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  platform. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=20.5s)]
*  In fact, it will move indoors here at the Capitol. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=21.5s)]
*  Traditionally, it's held on the grand west front of the Capitol with supporters lining [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=24.1s)]
*  the National Mall. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=28.619999999999997s)]
*  The temperatures here are going to be particularly brutal Monday. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=29.619999999999997s)]
*  It is also a possibility of a Sunday night snow event which makes things very dicey in [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=32.9s)]
*  the congested city of Washington, D.C. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=38.3s)]
*  So this is not a big surprise, but obviously it changes the optics of a presidential inaugural. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=40.62s)]
*  The last time this happened was 40 years ago when Ronald Reagan's second oath was taken [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=45.7s)]
*  indoors in the Capitol Rotunda. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=50.92s)]
*  Not the space you see beside me, but a few hundred feet away in the actual Capitol Rotunda [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=53.06s)]
*  which looks similar but is larger. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=58.3s)]
*  The proceedings will still happen at 12 p.m. presumably with the same speakers. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=61.019999999999996s)]
*  They have an inaugural parade for each presidential inauguration and according to the president-elect's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=66.14s)]
*  post and some of our reporting, they're going to move the parade indoors to Washington, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=71.62s)]
*  D.C.'s basketball arena where Donald Trump has a rally scheduled one day earlier anyhow. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=75.94s)]
*  It's the Capitol One arena about a mile or two from Capitol Hill. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=81.46000000000001s)]
*  We have an indoor event Monday which does a couple things. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=85.86s)]
*  It takes crowd size off the table as an issue that was surfacing in 2017, but it also makes [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=88.66s)]
*  it far less dangerous. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=94.26s)]
*  I've got to tell you, Liz, I attended any number of Trump rallies in the heat and there [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=95.26s)]
*  are people just fainting by the dozen. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=99.66s)]
*  There was concern about a more significant medical emergency in single-digit wind chills [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=101.94s)]
*  and barely teens' temperatures. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=106.98s)]
*  I can imagine it takes a lot of things off the table and so also in terms of security [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=109.98s)]
*  as well, Scott. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=113.78s)]
*  I want to get to some other breaking news that happened earlier today. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=114.78s)]
*  Ohio's governor announcing his pick to replace vice president-elect J.D. Vance in the Senate. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=118.02s)]
*  Who is expected to take his seat? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=123.5s)]
*  Is this another Trump loyalist? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=125.02s)]
*  This will be the lieutenant governor of Ohio who has had sights on running for governor [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=126.7s)]
*  to succeed. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=132.46s)]
*  Governor Mike DeWine. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=133.54s)]
*  The lieutenant governor is John Husted, a former House speaker in Ohio, a former secretary [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=134.54s)]
*  of state in Ohio. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=139.54s)]
*  When they're doing these short-term appointments to fill Senate seats, a lot of governors, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=141.22s)]
*  when they have that unique power, like to pick people who have statewide experience, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=145.26s)]
*  those who've held statewide office. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=149.94s)]
*  John Husted as the lieutenant governor and former secretary of state fits the bill just [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=152.22s)]
*  fine. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=156.66s)]
*  Doesn't have to learn about parts of the state he doesn't represent because he represents [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=157.66s)]
*  all of it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=160.94s)]
*  This is a two-year fill-in term. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=162.57999999999998s)]
*  When you're filling somebody else's shoes and appointee in the U.S. Senate, that seat [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=165.46s)]
*  goes back up for election. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=169.42s)]
*  The next election year in Congress, that's 2026. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=171.14s)]
*  But John Husted has a record of being deeply aligned with Donald Trump. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=175.22s)]
*  There was not an expectation that Mike DeWine was going to appoint a contrarian voice as [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=179.34s)]
*  a Republican with such narrow margins in the Congress. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=184.01999999999998s)]
*  Senate's going to be basically 53 to 47. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=188.14s)]
*  There is little space and interest by Republicans in having somebody who's not a loyalist to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=191.26s)]
*  Donald Trump in one of those seats. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=196.22s)]
*  Every vote is going to count. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=198.38s)]
*  All right, let's get back to speaking of voting. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=199.78s)]
*  Let's get back to the Senate hearing from earlier today, Scott. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=201.5s)]
*  One of the biggest issues President-elect Trump and Kristi Noem have with the Biden administration [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=204.78s)]
*  is its immigration policy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=209.26s)]
*  So how would it look different with Noem leading the DHS? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=211.66s)]
*  Kristi Noem was being questioned about how she's going to execute these particularly ambitious [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=217.42s)]
*  promises of Donald Trump for mass deportations in short order. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=222.18s)]
*  These are a process that takes time, takes money, takes manpower, not something that [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=226.82s)]
*  can be done quickly. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=231.26s)]
*  And that was the line of questioning Kristi Noem faced most frequently today. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=233.18s)]
*  How would she execute this plan? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=236.1s)]
*  She has answered as well as she can before she takes over the position and sees the inside [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=238.32s)]
*  of the operation. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=243.66s)]
*  But she's been unambiguous in her answers that she believes Donald Trump won the election [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=244.66s)]
*  based on those promises and that it is a top priority and something that needs to move expeditiously. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=250.06s)]
*  Kristi Noem believes she and the administration had a mandate to move fast on this, but clearly [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=256.3s)]
*  there's going to be a request of Congress to help fund this moving forward where that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=262.62s)]
*  narrow Republican majority becomes all the more critical for Donald Trump. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=267.1s)]
*  Yeah, interesting to see. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=271.06s)]
*  Alright, Scott McFarland, thanks to you so much for that live for us from Capitol Hill. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2UKbdFEtk&t=272.34000000000003s)]
