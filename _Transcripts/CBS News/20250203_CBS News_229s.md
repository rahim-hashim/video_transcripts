# FBI supervisors receive questionnaires for agents in Jan. 6 investigations, sources say
**CBS News:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM)
*  FBI supervisors across the country have received questionnaires to distribute to certain agents, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=0.0s)]
*  containing questions about their possible work on January 6th Capitol riot cases. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=5.04s)]
*  For more on this, I'm joined by CBS News Justice Department correspondent Scott McFarland. Scott, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=9.76s)]
*  what can you tell us about this questionnaire? What does it say? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=14.24s)]
*  This is a tumultuous 24 hours in the FBI, potentially in the history of the FBI, Lindsay. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=17.6s)]
*  This is such a provocative and groundbreaking thing that's underway there right now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=23.36s)]
*  As many as 5,000 FBI employees are being subject to scrutiny, according to our latest CBS News [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  reporting. They had a mid-afternoon deadline to complete this questionnaire, surveying [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=34.88s)]
*  agents and employees, but what roles they played in the January 6th [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=41.36s)]
*  riot investigation, which you'll recall is the largest criminal investigation in the Bureau's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=46.08s)]
*  history, the largest criminal investigation in U.S. history. And there's another deadline tomorrow, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=50.64s)]
*  12 p.m. Eastern time, for the FBI to turn over to the Trump-aligned interim leadership of the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=56.08s)]
*  Department of Justice the names of those FBI agents for potential employment actions against them. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=61.92s)]
*  It's worth reminding folks, the court system never laid a glove on the FBI's investigation [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=69.2s)]
*  of January 6th, never found problems or failures by the FBI. This is an investigation simply because [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=76.56s)]
*  of their nexus to the January 6 cases at all. Scott, what's your read on how unusual an action [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=83.36s)]
*  like this is and what message does it send to the FBI at the beginning of this new administration? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=90.08s)]
*  This is groundbreaking. This is unprecedented. What message does it send? Well, that really is [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=94.72s)]
*  the heart of the issue, Lindsay. No matter what disciplinary actions are handed down or not handed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=100.16s)]
*  down, whether there are mass firings or no firings, a message has already been sent to FBI employees [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=104.64s)]
*  nationwide to be careful the cases you undertake. There's only been political criticisms of January [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=111.12s)]
*  6th. This sends a message to be mindful of potential political criticisms coming down the road to new [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=118.4s)]
*  cases you undertake. Has a real chilling effect on agents and employees. And I'll note this, we're [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=125.12s)]
*  speaking with attorneys here in Washington who are considering some legal challenges on behalf of some [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=131.44s)]
*  of the FBI agents. Let me show you just an excerpt from a letter obtained by CBS News from a group of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=135.68s)]
*  attorneys who say they have picked up some FBI employees as clients. They've notified the interim [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=140.56s)]
*  Deputy Attorney General of the United States, a man named Emil Boeve, who was a Trump defense attorney [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=146.48s)]
*  in the Manhattan criminal case. Their letter to Boeve says, if you proceed with terminations and or [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=151.44s)]
*  public exposure of terminated employees' identities, we stand ready to vindicate their rights through [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=156.4s)]
*  all available legal means, indicating lawsuits could be filed. And that one phrase there, Lindsay, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=162.4s)]
*  public exposure of terminated employees' identities, that's critical because there is [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=168.96s)]
*  grave concern inside the FBI that a list of names of people part of the January 6th investigation, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=173.84s)]
*  if compiled and sent to the Department of Justice, would get leaked, subjecting those employees to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=179.6s)]
*  menacing harassment and threats. And everybody just got pardoned, who's implicated, or almost [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=185.04s)]
*  everybody. Scott, I have less than 30 seconds with you, which is not enough time for my next question. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  But what about checks and balances? We know that President Trump is remaking federal government, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=193.76000000000002s)]
*  expanding presidential power. Have we heard anything, for example, from Congress? We also know [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=198.4s)]
*  that the head of the FBI, we are expecting one of his loyalists to get confirmed. So is there any [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  potential pushback from anybody else in government on this? I got a 15-second answer for you, Lindsay. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=207.44s)]
*  I got you covered. There has been no Republican in the Senate who's raised his or her hand this [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=211.84s)]
*  weekend saying, this is unacceptable. We may not vote to confirm Cash Patel now as the new director. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=216.08s)]
*  And if he's confirmed, Lindsay, it could cement what's happening right now [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=221.12s)]
*  as a permanent part of the FBI's future. Scott McFarland, thank you. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADBWcuEvuM&t=225.68s)]
