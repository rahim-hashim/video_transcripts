# Mood in Israel after Hamas returns bodies of 4 hostages
**CBS News:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk)
*  All right, let's begin this morning in the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=0.0s)]
*  It is where Hamas has for the first time released the bodies of deceased Israeli hostages. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=2.36s)]
*  The remains are believed to be that of Shiri Bibus and her two children, Ariel and Kiffer, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=8.4s)]
*  as well as Oded Lifshitz. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=14.36s)]
*  All were kidnapped on October 7th of 2023. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  For more on this, let's bring in CBS News foreign correspondent Debra Pater joins us [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  now from Jerusalem. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=23.52s)]
*  Debra, talk to us about this handover. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=24.88s)]
*  We've seen footage of the bodies being moved through Israel. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=28.04s)]
*  What's happening at this stage? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=32.76s)]
*  Well, you know, as you said, a very somber day here, reflected in the grim weather as [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=34.32s)]
*  well for Israel. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=41.08s)]
*  For the past five weeks, Ariel, the images of the Red Cross and Gaza waiting for a hostage [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=42.08s)]
*  exchange have been really a sign of hope. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=47.04s)]
*  Captives taken by Hamas on the 7th of October released alive after more than 15 months in [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=50.2s)]
*  captivity. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=56.32s)]
*  But today there was no cause for celebration. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=57.36s)]
*  Hamas released the bodies of those four captives, Oded Lifshitz and the Bibus family, as you [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=60.52s)]
*  mentioned, Shiri and her two young boys. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=66.12s)]
*  Now Hamas claims that the Bibus trio were killed during an Israeli air raid early in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=69.16s)]
*  the first two months of this war. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=75.08s)]
*  Lifshitz has been identified by Israel, but relatives of the Bibus family still await [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=76.8s)]
*  official confirmation. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=82.8s)]
*  The Bibus siblings have really become a rallying symbol in this country. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  Their father Yarden was taken captive separately and released alive in a previous exchange. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=88.84s)]
*  So one can imagine this is a pretty tough day for him as they wait for the results of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  those DNA tests by Israel on the bodies. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=99.92s)]
*  Ariel? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=103.72s)]
*  Yeah, Deborah, and there seems to be two sides of this, you know, some sense of positivity [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=104.72s)]
*  that this ceasefire and hostage release deal is continuing, but it is jarring to see these [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=109.4s)]
*  images of children, these babies and their bodies being returned. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=114.92s)]
*  What is the reaction overall in Israel? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=118.48s)]
*  Well, you know, the next 10 days we'll see the final stages of phase one of the Gaza [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=123.96s)]
*  ceasefire, Deborah, and this really is the first time the bodies of hostages abducted [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=128.8s)]
*  by Hamas have been released. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=133.64s)]
*  So it's a very rough day for the country and one that has turned really into a spontaneous [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=135.36s)]
*  day of mourning. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  Even musicians have cancelled concerts out of respect for the dead. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  The Bibus family were from the near Oz kibbutz and this morning survivors from that kibbutz [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=145.68s)]
*  stood under umbrellas in the rain along the roads with the vehicles transporting those [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=150.88000000000002s)]
*  coffins passed by. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=156.08s)]
*  David Livshitz was also from that kibbutz. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=158.48s)]
*  He was 83, 84 now, killed in Gaza. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=160.72s)]
*  When he was taken hostage, though, he was still 83. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=166.44s)]
*  A former journalist and known really as a lifelong peace activist. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=170.0s)]
*  So that community is in deep mourning. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=174.24s)]
*  And this is part of phase one, Deborah, but where do things stand as far as getting closer [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=177.2s)]
*  to the next phase, phase two? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=181.96s)]
*  Well, the next phase is going to be a lot harder, Errol. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=185.4s)]
*  Israeli officials say negotiation for the second stage will commence in the coming days. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=188.88s)]
*  They haven't yet started. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=194.36s)]
*  Now if all the hostages expected to be freed in phase one are released as planned, then [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=196.72s)]
*  there would be over 50 hostages left in Gaza. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=202.76s)]
*  The Israeli government has already said at least 35 of those are dead. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  Now this week, one Hamas commander said in a statement that they are prepared to release [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  all the remaining hostages in one go in exchange for a permanent truce and a full withdrawal [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=216.64s)]
*  of Israeli troops from Gaza. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=222.32s)]
*  Israel, on the other hand, has said they will demand a complete demilitarization of Gaza [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=224.6s)]
*  and will not accept a Hamas presence there. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  And of course, in the middle of this are the people caught on both sides of this conflict. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=232.2s)]
*  Palestinians who have endured a punishing war for 15 months say they cannot go back [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=236.64s)]
*  to that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=242.04s)]
*  And the families of the remaining hostages who are still waiting for those who are inside [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=243.04s)]
*  Gaza waiting for their loved ones say negotiations cannot stop now. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=249.44s)]
*  The old Alexander, the mother of one of those hostages, Edan, believed to be the last living [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=254.32s)]
*  American captive, spoke to us and she had this message for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  saying, imagine if it was your son alive in Gaza waiting to be released. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=265.48s)]
*  You need to bring everyone home now. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=271.8s)]
*  Errol? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=274.56s)]
*  Deborah Pater, joining us live from Jerusalem. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=275.56s)]
*  Deb, we always appreciate your reporting. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=277.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=279.92s)]
*  And among those waiting for their relatives to return is Alana Zaitchik. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=280.92s)]
*  Six of her family members were taken hostage on October 7th and they've all been released [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=286.08s)]
*  except for one, her cousin's husband, David Cunio, who still remains in captivity. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=291.04s)]
*  I spoke with Alana earlier on the CBS Morning News. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=296.52000000000004s)]
*  Some of my family members were in tunnels. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=300.72s)]
*  Some of them were in a house and then a hospital. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=302.68s)]
*  One of the children was held by herself for 10 days in the beginning. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=307.16s)]
*  One of the three-year-old twins. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=311.40000000000003s)]
*  So it's a horror show to be held in captivity. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=312.84000000000003s)]
*  David, we just actually received a sign of life from a returned hostage who was free, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=317.12s)]
*  who told us that they saw him recently alive. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=323.56s)]
*  So this has filled my family with a strength that we didn't have before, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  knowing that he's recently been seen alive. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=332.2s)]
*  Until every single hostage is home, I don't think the healing can actually begin. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=334.48s)]
*  The children have nightmares. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=339.72s)]
*  My cousin has PTSD flashbacks of terrorists outside the house. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=341.68s)]
*  And, you know, there's no scenario in which the healing begins until every single hostage is home. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=345.32s)]
*  And we so appreciate Alana speaking with CBS News. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=353.4s)]
*  She also said she and her family hope David will be released during phase two of the ceasefire deal. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=356.35999999999996s)]
*  We will, of course, keep you posted. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSpEd-qSYk&t=362.35999999999996s)]
