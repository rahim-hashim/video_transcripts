# Pasadena public health emergency over wildfire ashes
**CBS News:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs)
*  A public health emergency is now in effect in Pasadena, California. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=0.0s)]
*  While the Eden Fire is more than halfway contained, officials say the toxic ash and debris pose [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=4.7s)]
*  a threat to people in the area. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=9.58s)]
*  Four fires are still burning in the LA area, wind gusts are easing, making conditions easier [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=11.78s)]
*  for firefighters. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=16.78s)]
*  But Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is urging residents to continue to pay attention to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=17.78s)]
*  evacuation orders. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=21.3s)]
*  If you're in an area where you're not supposed to be, please leave. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=23.14s)]
*  If you're in an area that is still facing a warning, please get ready to leave now and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=29.08s)]
*  consider leaving early. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=35.16s)]
*  Let's go ahead now to CBS News reporter Andres Gutierrez in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=39.8s)]
*  Andres, thank you for being here. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  What are the conditions like right now and what is the wind forecasted to do? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  Well, good day, Lindsay. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=49.76s)]
*  At this point, there is just a gentle breeze here in Palisades area. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=52.34s)]
*  You can see that there is a gentle breeze, just enough for that flag to be waving there [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=56.74s)]
*  in the distance. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=61.1s)]
*  The red flag warning won only in place just north of us in Ventura County, where they [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=62.3s)]
*  may experience wind gusts of up to 20 miles per hour in the active and semi valley areas. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  The fire chief noted today during the news conference that while they did experience [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=72.06s)]
*  those Santa Ana winds yesterday, it did not cause the Palisades fire to expand. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=76.42s)]
*  As of now, it is bearing more than 23,000 acres and they've contained 22 percent of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=81.46s)]
*  it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=87.0s)]
*  They have until Monday to continue increasing that containment area before the Santa Ana [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=88.0s)]
*  winds pick up again on through the region during that day on Monday. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=91.52s)]
*  Officials have said it'll be at least another week before residents can make it back to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  the fire zone. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  Right now, utility crews are making sure that there is no danger to the public, and that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=101.6s)]
*  off the natural gas lines as well as the electrical lines because the last thing they need is [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=107.16s)]
*  for folks to get back to the zone, to come across a downed line and they throw back the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=112.97999999999999s)]
*  energy on and for that person to get electrocuted. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=118.06s)]
*  Besides that, the EPA is going around assessing any hazardous materials because you had pesticides, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=120.94s)]
*  you have lithium ion batteries, gasoline that burned during these wildfires, and so they [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=126.96s)]
*  need to assess where those are at and clean those up before they can let the general public [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=131.74s)]
*  back in. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=136.56s)]
*  They also do realize that there are thousands of people in these neighborhoods who left [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=137.76000000000002s)]
*  with maybe just the clothes on their back, and so they're encouraging those folks to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=142.56s)]
*  go to these disaster recovery centers to make sure that they can pick up perhaps some donated [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=145.9s)]
*  clothing or replace their prescriptions or replace those lost documentations. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  I got to be quick with you, Andres, but what are officials doing to prevent price gouging? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=159.94s)]
*  Well, the attorney general said that they are opening investigations into price gouging [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=164.46s)]
*  here during any natural disaster. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=170.02s)]
*  It is against the law, state law, to charge more than 10 percent of whatever prices were, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=172.82s)]
*  but they are apparently happening, and so they are encouraging folks to report it to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=179.06s)]
*  them. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=183.46s)]
*  If there is any instance of price gouging, that is 800-952-5225. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=185.08s)]
*  Andres Gutierrez, thank you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  California Governor Gavin Newsom is banning what he calls predatory land buyouts of property [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=195.12s)]
*  damaged by the fires. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=199.44s)]
*  The temporary order prevents land speculators of making unsolicited, undervalued offers [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=201.24s)]
*  to people who lost their homes and 15 specific fire-damaged zip codes, including the devastated [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=206.08s)]
*  neighborhood of Altadena. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=211.34s)]
*  Hawaii issued a similar order following the Maui fires in August of 2023. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=213.46s)]
*  As fire conditions slowly improve in LA, a winter snowstorm is making its way to the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=218.22s)]
*  Midwest. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=222.54000000000002s)]
*  CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Grant Gilmore has the forecast. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=223.54000000000002s)]
*  So we're beginning to see some improvement across Southern California. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=227.18s)]
*  Still a concern for some fire weather today. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=230.54000000000002s)]
*  A red flag warning in effect for portions of Los Angeles and Ventura County today through [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=232.9s)]
*  three o'clock Pacific time this afternoon. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=237.52s)]
*  Wind gusts are still a little breezy today, so we have an elevated risk for fire weather [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=241.12s)]
*  through the afternoon. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=245.64s)]
*  The good news is though that conditions will be much better tomorrow with some higher relative [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=246.88s)]
*  humidity moving in. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  Wind gusts today at 15-20 mph, maybe occasionally gusting up to around 30 mph. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=252.23999999999998s)]
*  As we go into the day tomorrow, I think they die down, becoming a little breezy tomorrow [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=257.59999999999997s)]
*  afternoon. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=261.56s)]
*  But with that humidity, there will be a definite smaller risk for that fire danger tomorrow. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=262.56s)]
*  Meanwhile across the Great Lakes into the Northeast, tracking a system that could actually bring 6 to 12 inches of snow to the highest elevations to the Appalachians through West Virginia. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=269.26s)]
*  And then this Arctic blast begins to nose in from the north as we go into Friday and Saturday. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=278.26s)]
*  Look at some of these forecasts. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=283.65999999999997s)]
*  High temperatures focus on Minneapolis. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=285.06s)]
*  High temperatures in Minneapolis as we go into Sunday. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=287.21999999999997s)]
*  Three below zero. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=290.21999999999997s)]
*  You're talking about temperatures 20 to 30 degrees colder than normal. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=291.21999999999997s)]
*  This Arctic air invades the eastern two-thirds of the country as we look ahead to the beginning of next week. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  You're looking at high temperatures in places like Detroit only at 10, running 20 degrees below normal. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  And that Arctic air will hang around as we head through the majority of next week. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  Greg Gilmore, thank you. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FAfLApvDs&t=313.15999999999997s)]
