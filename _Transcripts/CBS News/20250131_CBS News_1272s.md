# Latest details on D.C. plane crash, ATC conditions, chopper crew and Trump reaction
**CBS News:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw)
*  officials took a major step forward in the investigation at that mid air [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=0.0s)]
*  collision between an american airlines passenger jet and an army black hawk [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=5.92s)]
*  helicopter near Washington D. C. Wednesday night. And as you can see here, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=10.4s)]
*  the National Transportation Safety Board confirms two black boxes from the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=14.46s)]
*  american airlines aircraft have been recovered. Those black boxes will now [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=18.56s)]
*  be analyzed by the NTSB lab about a mile away from the crash site. And [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=23.0s)]
*  here's what else we know this morning as officials raced to find answers on [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=27.6s)]
*  how this crash happened in the first place. CBS News analysis of public [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  publicly available flight data found the black hawk helicopter may have been [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=35.44s)]
*  flying above the permitted altitude. That data showed the helicopter reached [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=39.72s)]
*  about 400 ft when it crashed just above the crucial 200 ft ceiling. Now back on [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=44.92s)]
*  the ground operations resumed today after those efforts were paused due to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  dangerous conditions. The D. C. Fire chief says floating ice and wind made [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=55.28s)]
*  operations very difficult right now. Temperatures in the Potomac River are [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=60.2s)]
*  about 35 degrees. Now those crews are also looking to resume recovering [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=64.76s)]
*  bodies from the water. At least 40 bodies have been recovered so far and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=69.68s)]
*  officials believe there were no survivors. And we're also learning more [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  today about some of the victims on board that plane. Six members of the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=78.4s)]
*  Boston Figure Skating Club were killed in that crash. Transportation Secretary [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=82.22000000000001s)]
*  Sean Duffy met with some of the families that lost their loved ones in [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=87.06s)]
*  this tragedy in a social media post late last night. Duffy said quote, their [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=90.26s)]
*  pain is immeasurable. I can't take away their pain, but I can do a very small [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=94.9s)]
*  part to help ease it by keeping my promise to get to the bottom of what [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=99.98s)]
*  happened and to be 100% transparent about the results of the investigation. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=103.86000000000001s)]
*  They have my word. Duffy is scheduled to visit the FAA Command Center later on [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=109.54s)]
*  today to continue this investigation. CBS News correspondent Skyler Henry [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=114.04s)]
*  joins us now from Reagan National Airport for more on all of this. Skyler, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=118.18s)]
*  thank you for being with us. What information can investigators learn [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=122.10000000000001s)]
*  from those black boxes that were recovered from the American Airlines [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=125.30000000000001s)]
*  flight? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=128.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's good to be with you as always. They can receive the cockpit [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=130.28s)]
*  voice recorder, which will include conversations between pilots, also [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=134.3s)]
*  including conversations between those pilots and air traffic control. And [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=138.68s)]
*  that also includes any unusual sounds, whether that emergency or anything [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=142.84s)]
*  happening in the cockpit itself so that it will help potential investigators [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  try to navigate exactly what could have been behind that collision that we saw [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=152.4s)]
*  on Wednesday night. Now we also have learned that those black boxes could [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=158.16s)]
*  also include that flight data recorder, and that will show everything from [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=161.82s)]
*  altitude, airspeed headings, and it will also include engine performance, control [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=166.44s)]
*  inputs, flaps and landing gear positions, really necessary details and data that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=173.16s)]
*  will help the NTSB reconstruct exactly what happened at the time of this [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=178.16s)]
*  collision and really sort of deduce to figure out what caused this problem in [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=183.36s)]
*  the first place. They will also be looking to try to match that information [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=188.28s)]
*  with what they are able to recover from the military aircraft. We know that the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=192.36s)]
*  Department of Defense as well as other aspects of the military are working to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=195.64s)]
*  help with the FAA and help the NTSB really put all of this together. They say [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=198.64s)]
*  that this will be a meticulous, steady and thorough investigation made up of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=203.92s)]
*  several working groups and parts, a systems group, a human performance group [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=208.6s)]
*  that will actually review what the pilots were doing, what they were saying, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=212.51999999999998s)]
*  what air traffic control was doing and saying. They also have a helicopter group [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=216.48s)]
*  component to this as well, determining what that chopper was doing at the time [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=221.16s)]
*  of the collision, whether they had any mechanical issues on board of the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=225.56s)]
*  aircraft, or whether there was any sort of issue between the communications [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=230.48s)]
*  between the aircraft and air traffic control. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=234.0s)]
*  Yeah, speaking that communication, Skyler, we have some more details about [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=236.24s)]
*  what might have happened inside Reagan National Airport, specifically at the air [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=240.0s)]
*  traffic control tower. We want to play back the sound of that conversation [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=244.32s)]
*  between Flight 5342 and air traffic control, the tower before the crash. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=247.88s)]
*  Let's take a listen. We'll talk to you on the other side. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=253.44s)]
*  Yeah, we can do 334.3, 323.42. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=277.88s)]
*  334.3, 323.42, welcome to the station. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=282.56s)]
*  Thank you for runway 33, runway 33, cleared for land. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=284.64s)]
*  Thanks, runway 33, runway 33, 323.42. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=288.0s)]
*  Now Skyler, CBS News has learned the same air traffic control worker managing [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=293.44s)]
*  helicopter traffic was also handling some planes taking off and landing around [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=299.48s)]
*  the same time of the collision. Can you walk us through some of the confusion [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  here around how those seats inside the tower are managed? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=308.6s)]
*  Well, typically what we would see inside an air traffic control tower is one [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=314.8s)]
*  controller dealing with helicopters and another dealing with planes. And given [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=319.76s)]
*  the amount of activity happening here at the airport and the time of day, they [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=327.04s)]
*  say that it was really more accustomed to seeing two people inside of air [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=332.52s)]
*  traffic control as opposed to the one, but they also want to stress that this [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=337.44s)]
*  is not something that is rare. Air traffic control towers usually aren't [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=340.96s)]
*  staffed, given the recent circumstances surrounding funding and all sorts of [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=346.79999999999995s)]
*  other issues at 100% all of the time. And so they say that this is something [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=350.68s)]
*  that isn't necessarily an anomaly, but it is less than usual. We did get some [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=356.03999999999996s)]
*  sound from the air traffic control union president earlier today on CBS [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=360.92s)]
*  Mornings. Take a listen to this. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=366.52000000000004s)]
*  We have a controller shortage in this nation. 10,800 certified controllers are [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=368.82s)]
*  out there doing this job day in and day out where there should be 14,335. Now [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=373.88s)]
*  the specifics to this situation itself, since it's under investigation, I can't [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=379.24s)]
*  speak directly to that, but it is not uncommon for us to routinely combined [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=384.06s)]
*  positions. There is usually someone in a supervisory position looking at the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=390.12s)]
*  overall workload and complexity in order to make those determinations of what [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=393.76000000000005s)]
*  positions we need open and when we need them open. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=397.40000000000003s)]
*  So as I was pointing out, not uncommon, certainly less than ideal if in a [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=401.16s)]
*  perfect world, but something that these air traffic controllers have to deal [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=407.52000000000004s)]
*  with on a daily basis, given the financial and staffing shortages [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=411.32000000000005s)]
*  throughout the country, not just here at Reagan National Airport. But that's [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=416.12s)]
*  also something that the NTSB says that they will be listening and looking for [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=418.96s)]
*  as part of their preliminary investigation as well. You know, these [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=422.32s)]
*  are the times where you can, you know, sort of play that monday morning [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=425.84s)]
*  quarterback role to see what could we have done better? How could we have [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=429.59999999999997s)]
*  improved this situation so that something like this doesn't happen again [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=433.36s)]
*  obviously, but also look to make sure everything was being followed as it [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=436.88s)]
*  relates to protocol and command. Yeah, there could be another issue at play [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=441.28s)]
*  here as well. Skyler Reagan National Airport is one of three in the country [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=445.26000000000005s)]
*  considered to be capacity constraint. It's designed to serve as 15 million [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=448.62s)]
*  passengers a year. But right now it processes more than 26 million. Are [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=453.22s)]
*  investigators looking into if that played a role in this crash? Just the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=458.64000000000004s)]
*  congestion in the sky? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=462.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, one of the things about this airport is that it is known for its [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=467.14000000000004s)]
*  congestion because of the amount of aircraft that come in and out of here [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=470.36s)]
*  for different reasons. That's everything from commercial flights to [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=474.42s)]
*  military flights to private flights. All of these things are sort of happening [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=477.22s)]
*  in sort of this orchestra, so to speak. And for the last, you know, decades, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=481.3s)]
*  this has not been an issue. It is not unusual to see military aircraft flying [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=487.34000000000003s)]
*  above not only Reagan National Airport, but in many places at low altitudes [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=492.54s)]
*  surrounding the Washington D. C. Metro area on either training missions or [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=496.86s)]
*  actual missions themselves, escorting VIPs, moving throughout military bases [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=501.08000000000004s)]
*  in and around this area as well. And so because it is so routine, I think many [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=507.68s)]
*  people have grown accustomed to seeing those types of things in and around this [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=512.12s)]
*  airport. Again, that will be a part of the review process as well. We know that [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=515.64s)]
*  that is a subject that is actually being taken up by lawmakers on Capitol Hill [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=519.48s)]
*  to see if there are some adjustments that can be altered in that capacity as [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=523.2s)]
*  well, because this is a congested airspace and because this is an anomaly, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=528.2s)]
*  so to speak, because it is essentially in the heart of government and so many [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=532.32s)]
*  things need to happen here. That is why we heard from Defense Secretary Pete [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=536.2s)]
*  Hegseth yesterday who said that the reason that this training mission was [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=541.08s)]
*  happening in the first place was because there will be times that important VIPs [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=544.2s)]
*  have to come in and out of this area. And the reality is that it will also be [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=549.72s)]
*  happening at times of commercial air travel as well. And so that is why this [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=554.32s)]

*  for that. Now, three Army Army soldiers were also on board that Black Hawk [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=562.9200000000001s)]
*  helicopter when it collided with the plane, and we're starting to learn more [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=567.72s)]
*  about one of them. Crew chief Ryan O'Hara leaves behind a wife and a one [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=571.36s)]
*  year old son. The Army said he, along with the pilot and co pilot of that [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=576.12s)]
*  chopper, were very experienced moments ago. CBS News got an exclusive interview [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=580.7199999999999s)]
*  with O'Hara's father. Take a listen to how he says he got the tragic news [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=585.52s)]
*  about his son. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=590.2199999999999s)]
*  It's really like your worst nightmare is as a as a parent of somebody in the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=592.68s)]
*  soldier in the military, seeing two army officers at my port door. It's [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=596.4s)]
*  heartbreaking [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=603.3599999999999s)]
*  to witness basically witness your son's death in the news. It's devastating. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=605.4799999999999s)]
*  So I don't know. I keep wondering if my wife and I, Taryn, will ever feel like [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=611.68s)]
*  we're gonna be whole again because we're just broken. You're just [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=616.4799999999999s)]
*  heartbreaking to hear that from that father. We'll have much more on that [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=621.28s)]
*  exclusive interview on tonight's CBS Evening News. For now, let's turn to [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=624.7199999999999s)]
*  CBS News senior national security correspondent Charlie Daggett. Charlie, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=628.9599999999999s)]
*  thank you for being with us today. That father clearly very emotional. Any [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=632.7199999999999s)]
*  parents worse nightmare. What more do we know about his son, Ryan O'Hara? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=637.64s)]
*  Well, I mean, we look forward to that interview that Mark conducted. Um, to [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=644.6s)]
*  be frank, we don't have a lot of information out of this building. And [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=650.68s)]
*  the reason why is because the crew members of that Black Hawk helicopter [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=654.3199999999999s)]
*  have yet to be identified here. They haven't officially made the announcement. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=660.08s)]
*  So although it's been on social media, obviously, Mark spoke to his dad. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=663.6s)]
*  It's difficult for us to sort of delve into the service history or to get [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=668.3199999999999s)]
*  anything on him yet because the names of the people on that helicopter have not [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=672.68s)]
*  been released yet. We expect that this afternoon. But as you said, he's been [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=676.68s)]
*  described as very experienced along with the rest of the crew. He would have [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=680.68s)]
*  flown this route and this exercise multiple times. He was the crew chief on [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=684.3199999999999s)]
*  that Black Hawk. We believe he's been serving for just under 10 years. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=690.12s)]
*  And Charlie, we're also learning more detail details about the actual path of [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=695.52s)]
*  this Black Hawk helicopter. And there's been some speculation, including from [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=701.1999999999999s)]
*  the president, that the helicopter was flying higher than it was supposed to, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=705.0799999999999s)]
*  not at the right altitude. Is the military saying anything about that? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=709.28s)]
*  Right. So first of all, we did put that to army officials who urged caution and [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=715.92s)]
*  investigation reveals more. However, data that we've seen from open sources, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=721.28s)]
*  references like flight radar and flight aware shows that the Black Hawks [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=726.52s)]
*  estimated altitude was around 400 ft before the collision, which doesn't sound [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=731.28s)]
*  high, but that's far above the 200 ft ceiling allowed for military helicopter [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=736.48s)]
*  flights anywhere near that airport. And that we have officially at 200 ft ceiling. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=742.68s)]
*  And earlier today, Defense Secretary Pete Hegs said, and I'm quoting here, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=748.32s)]
*  they're looking at altitude and the president was clear about that. Someone [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=752.24s)]
*  was at the wrong altitude. Was the Black Hawk too high? Was it on course? Right [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=757.88s)]
*  now, we don't quite know. So that is going to be one of the key questions here. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=761.72s)]
*  It's all part of the investigation. I've also spoken to people, helicopter pilots [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=766.0s)]
*  who said that doesn't necessarily mean they were that far off course. It's much, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=769.9200000000001s)]
*  much higher. It's not just over 200. It's 400. But sometimes that's part of [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=774.76s)]
*  the of the exercise. So it's not necessarily I was gonna say doesn't. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=779.76s)]
*  It's not as reckless as it sounds. What I mean is it's not as extreme as it may [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=785.24s)]
*  sound. And this was interesting. Charlie, the secretary of the Army nominee [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=788.8s)]
*  Daniel Driscoll said yesterday that quote, it's an accident that seems to be [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=793.16s)]
*  preventable from what we can tell unquote. And they may need to goes on to [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=797.3199999999999s)]
*  the appropriate time to do these types of missions. And he also said it may not [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=803.0s)]
*  be at a busy airport like Reagan National. Are you hearing anything from [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=807.0799999999999s)]
*  military today about potentially changing the strategy when it comes to [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=811.28s)]
*  these types of training missions, moving them to a different location? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=815.52s)]
*  Right. The short answer on that is no, partly because there's been a pause on [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=820.52s)]
*  any of those missions. As of about 24 hours ago, it was a 48 hour pause on [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=825.8399999999999s)]
*  these helicopter missions that might be extended. We also understand, you know, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=831.44s)]
*  the FAA gets a vote on this too, and they could ban those flights. But as [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=835.8800000000001s)]
*  far as the military is concerned, there hasn't been a stop on it at least yet. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=840.0400000000001s)]
*  I'm sure they're reviewing that. But it has been drilled into me that this is [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=845.6s)]
*  a routine exercise. These are routine assessments. And if you live here like [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=849.9200000000001s)]
*  I've just moved here, you see helicopters along the Potomac and around [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=854.6600000000001s)]
*  Reagan National Airport all the time, day and night. It's always shocked me, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=858.32s)]
*  the prevalence of the helicopters around here, obviously around the Pentagon [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=865.12s)]
*  itself. So that is routine. It's been going on. I spoke to a Blackhawk [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=868.32s)]
*  helicopter pilot yesterday. That's been going on essentially since 911. He was [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=873.94s)]
*  flying in 2002, 2003, doing the same exact exercises. He thought he was on [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=878.36s)]
*  that same exact helicopter. So none of this is new. And the increase in [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=883.96s)]
*  frequency, none of that is new. These are standard, routine flights that have [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=888.44s)]
*  been going on for years. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=893.0400000000001s)]
*  CBS News, senior national security correspondent Charlie Daggett. Thank you [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=895.32s)]
*  so much for that insight, sir. President Trump, meanwhile, doubling down on his [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=898.48s)]
*  criticism of DEI policies and the FAA signing two executive orders. The first [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=902.4000000000001s)]
*  appointing Chris Rochelieu, the deputy administrator of the FAA. The [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=908.36s)]
*  second undoing the damage the White House says has been done to aviation [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=913.28s)]
*  safety by the Biden administration's quote DEI and woke policies. That's a [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=918.16s)]
*  quote. Now, when asked if he was aware of any performance issues or [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=923.9s)]
*  disciplinary actions taken against those working during the mid air [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=928.16s)]
*  collision, he said this. Take a listen. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=932.24s)]
*  The Senate today confidence may have played a role. Are you aware of any [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=935.4399999999999s)]
*  performance issues or disciplinary actions that were taken against anyone [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=939.6s)]
*  who was working the tower last night or flying the plane? No, no. And I hope [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=943.6s)]
*  that's not the case in this case, but certainly over the years has been the [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=947.6s)]
*  case. And it's the case with respect to close calls, and it's the case with [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=951.08s)]
*  respect to circling for hours on end. You know, planes circle a lot and they [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=955.28s)]
*  circle because the people bringing him down these people that have to be very, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=960.12s)]
*  very smart. And it's not based on anything other than the brain. We need [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=964.48s)]
*  the smartest people. We need both psychologically smart and just [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=969.32s)]
*  brilliant period. And we are going to have them in our in our control towers. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=973.08s)]
*  We're gonna have we are going to have the most competent people in the [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=977.72s)]
*  country in our control towers. All right. With that, let's go live to [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=981.6s)]
*  Washington D. C. In our C. B. S. News senior White House and political [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=985.24s)]
*  correspondent Ed O'Keefe. Ed, great to see you. Our C. B. S. News team [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=988.24s)]
*  confirmed that the time to get the fact took the time to get the facts, and [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=991.92s)]
*  they found that it's been a long standing FAA policy, including before, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=996.36s)]
*  during and after President Trump's first term to include people with [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1000.4399999999999s)]
*  disabilities in recruitment like the ones the president just mentioned [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1005.0s)]
*  during his sharp reboot yesterday. What more can you tell us about these [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1008.9399999999999s)]
*  particular policies? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1012.92s)]
*  Right. So remember, he has signed Elizabeth a series of orders in the [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1016.0s)]
*  last few days since returning to office that in essence undo Biden era [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1019.58s)]
*  policies, including any diversity, equity, inclusion programs established [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1024.02s)]
*  at federal agencies and departments. The ones that he cited in his press [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1028.26s)]
*  briefing to have about 24 hours ago is that FAA policy that was on the [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1031.74s)]
*  agency's website since at least 2013, including throughout his first term. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1036.5s)]
*  It was designed to ensure the FAA was recruiting people for a variety of [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1040.8600000000001s)]
*  roles who might have disabilities. Another program that was established [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1043.9s)]
*  in the Trump administration during the first Trump administration aimed to help [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1047.62s)]
*  people with disabilities prepare for careers in air traffic operations. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1051.3799999999999s)]
*  But turns out the FAA hired just one person out of that program by the end [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1055.58s)]
*  of 2021 of one potential air traffic controller trainee, not even clear that [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1061.62s)]
*  that person would be qualified to be working in an air traffic control tower [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1066.46s)]
*  like the one at Reagan by now if they're still in the FAA system throughout [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1070.1s)]
*  his campaign. Remember, he campaigned on the idea that these kinds of DEI [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1074.26s)]
*  programs were leading agencies and departments to take their eye off the [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1077.8600000000001s)]
*  ball and they were not necessarily doing their actual missions, but focus [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1080.8600000000001s)]
*  too much on these kinds of workplace culture and hiring quota programs. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1084.9s)]
*  He's trying to undo them. And as we saw yesterday, immediately tried to suggest [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1090.58s)]
*  that this has something to do with what has been a decades long issue with [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1094.74s)]
*  technology, with recruitment, with training and with increased air traffic [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1098.94s)]
*  and demand and a dwindling, if not small number of air traffic control [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1103.5s)]
*  professionals who know how to safely get those planes in and out of the skies. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1108.38s)]
*  Now, can you walk us through, though, those two executive orders you mentioned [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1112.46s)]
*  the president signed yesterday? What are they going to do? We know one is [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1116.02s)]
*  gonna point the FAA administrator and the second deals with those DEI [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1119.18s)]
*  policies. So what are those executive orders specifically say? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1123.82s)]
*  Okay, so the first one makes this guy named Chris Rochello, the acting [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1128.7s)]
*  administrator. So he's gonna have to go through a Senate confirmation hearing [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1132.58s)]
*  at some point. This is somebody with more than 20 years of experience at [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1135.3799999999999s)]
*  the FAA, had just been appointed the temporary or the acting deputy [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1138.34s)]
*  administrator. Last week now he's the guy in charge of the place and [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1142.6599999999999s)]
*  obviously has the president's attention, given what happened over the skies [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1145.74s)]
*  of the Potomac River on Wednesday night. It speaks, though, however, to the [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1150.34s)]
*  fact that there have been a series of administrators at FAA over the last [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1154.74s)]
*  several years because this is a budget crunched resource strapped place and [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1158.62s)]
*  the air traffic community, the aviation community generally has been warning [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1163.3s)]
*  Congress and the White House and the transportation department for years. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1167.06s)]
*  You don't have enough qualified people to run these towers. You're gonna [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1170.6599999999999s)]
*  have problems like the ones that ensued on Wednesday night. We'll see if [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1173.5s)]
*  Rochello is able to fix that. The other one essentially doubled up on the [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1176.62s)]
*  executive orders that he'd signed last week, Elizabeth, and just said that [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1181.46s)]
*  we've got to review all hiring decisions and changes to safety protocols [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1184.46s)]
*  made during the prior four years and to take such corrective action as [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1188.26s)]
*  necessary to achieve uncompromised aviation safety, including, interestingly, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1191.5s)]
*  it says here, including the replacement of any individuals who do not meet [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1196.1s)]
*  qualification standards. This review shall include a systematic assessment [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1199.9s)]
*  of any deterioration in hiring standards and aviation safety standards [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1204.14s)]
*  and protocols during the Biden administration. So once again, it's in [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1207.42s)]
*  essence an accusation in search of proof to some extent because he's alleging [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1211.5s)]
*  that these programs that have only been put in the last few years may have [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1219.58s)]
*  contributed to this when if you talk to the aviation safety experts, the air [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1222.78s)]
*  traffic controllers, the union heads that we've had on our air over the [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1226.54s)]
*  last 48 hours will tell you to be an air traffic controller in a tower like [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1229.7s)]
*  the one at Reagan takes multiple years of training, of certification, and it's [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1234.54s)]
*  very unlikely that anyone that would have been hired in the last four years [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1240.8999999999999s)]
*  would have been working alone manning helicopters and aircraft over a [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1243.74s)]
*  commercial airport like Reagan on Wednesday night, all of it to come out, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1248.4599999999998s)]
*  of course, in the coming weeks, months and years as the investigation [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1252.34s)]
*  continues. Yeah, and the investigation is continuing. We still don't know [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1254.9799999999998s)]
*  exactly what caused this horrible crash on Wednesday. A lot of this is still a [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1258.82s)]
*  lot of allegations, a lot of speculations. We still don't know what [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1263.3s)]
*  the true cause was. All right, CBS News Senior White House and political [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1266.54s)]
*  correspondent at O'Keeffe. Thanks so much, Ed. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5biu0E7cBjw&t=1270.14s)]
