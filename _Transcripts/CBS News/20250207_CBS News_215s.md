# Justice Department appeals after 2nd judge blocks birthright citizenship order
**CBS News:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4)
*  The Justice Department has appealed a federal judge's order, blocking President Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=0.0s)]
*  executive order that would end birthright citizenship. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=4.88s)]
*  This is the second federal judge now in just two days that ruled against that order. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=8.4s)]
*  It seeks to end the automatic grant of citizenship to children born in the U.S. if their parents [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  are in the country illegally. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=19.2s)]
*  For more on this, I'm joined now by CBS News immigration and politics reporter, Camilo [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=21.6s)]
*  Montoya Galvez. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=25.6s)]
*  So Camilo, it was almost expected that judges would intervene here, but where does that [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=27.0s)]
*  place the ruling and the status of people who are curious if this will come to fruition? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=33.0s)]
*  Good morning, Errol. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=39.96s)]
*  That is completely right. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=40.96s)]
*  Now two federal judges across the U.S. have found that President Trump's dramatic bid [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=42.38s)]
*  to severely restrict birthright citizenship is likely in direct conflict with the U.S. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  Constitution. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=54.72s)]
*  As you know, Errol, has long been interpreted to mean that if you are born here physically [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=56.72s)]
*  on American soil, you are automatically an American citizen, irrespective of the status [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=61.32s)]
*  of your parents. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=67.6s)]
*  But President Trump had instructed federal agencies like the State Department to deny [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=68.68s)]
*  birthright citizenship to the children of not just people who are in the country illegally, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=74.28s)]
*  Errol, but also temporary visa holders, legal immigrants here on a temporary short-term [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=78.72s)]
*  basis. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  But now these two judges have said that likely violates the Constitution. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  And if I may, I actually want to read a part of the ruling from the judge in Seattle yesterday. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=89.44s)]
*  He says, Errol, that citizenship by right is an unequivocal constitutional right. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=95.14s)]
*  It is one of the precious principles that makes the United States a great nation that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=100.68s)]
*  it is. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=104.56s)]
*  The president cannot change, limit, or qualify this constitutional right via an executive [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=105.56s)]
*  order. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=111.2s)]
*  So some pretty scathing and clear language from the judge in Seattle, a Reagan appointee [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=112.2s)]
*  against this order by the president. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=118.48s)]
*  The status quo remains that this order will continue to be blocked in court. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=120.36s)]
*  But of course, as you mentioned, now there is an appeal filed by the Justice Department. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=125.76s)]
*  I want to also ask you about some of your other reporting about the administration's [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=130.72s)]
*  plan to send, I guess, daily flights with migrants to Guantanamo Bay. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=134.48s)]
*  Help us understand how that is supposed to work. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=140.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, Errol, the administration has already sent two military aircraft to Guantanamo Bay [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  with about two dozen Venezuelan migrant detainees to hold them there as part of this larger [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  operation to convert the naval base there in that Cuban land on a U.S. lease into a [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=155.6s)]
*  large-scale immigration detention center at the direction, of course, of President Trump, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=162.70000000000002s)]
*  who has made this issue, as you know, a top priority for him, especially when it comes [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=168.3s)]
*  to the so-called Tren de Aragua Venezuelan gang. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=173.54000000000002s)]
*  We are told by U.S. officials that all the detainees so far who have been sent to this [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=177.32000000000002s)]
*  part of Cuba are suspected members of this notorious Venezuelan prison gang. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=182.46s)]
*  And the plan now, we are told, is to send near-daily flights to the island to house [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=188.42s)]
*  and detain as many people as possible at the naval base. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=194.78s)]
*  And so officials now, we are told, are scrambling to hire enough staff and get enough resources [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=198.94s)]
*  to that base to be able to meet the president's very ambitious demands, Errol. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=205.57999999999998s)]
*  All right, Camilo Montoya-Galvez, we appreciate all of your reporting. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=210.54s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKw8L55rTY4&t=214.01999999999998s)]
