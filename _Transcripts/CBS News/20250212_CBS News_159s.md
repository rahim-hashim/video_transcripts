# Trump indicates Marc Fogel's release from Russia could help end war in Ukraine
**CBS News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw)
*  President Trump has indicated that Mark Fogel's release from Russia could help bring an end [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=0.0s)]
*  to the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=5.04s)]
*  I think this could be the very important element. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=7.68s)]
*  You could be a big part of it, actually, because it could be a big important part of getting [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=10.52s)]
*  the war over with Ukraine. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=15.36s)]
*  And that's no small statement. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=17.52s)]
*  For more on this, let's bring in CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=19.2s)]
*  joining us from our London bureau. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=22.52s)]
*  Holly, what will be Ukraine's view of this? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=24.28s)]
*  And are we any closer to bringing that war to an end? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=27.84s)]
*  Good morning, Errol. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=31.72s)]
*  Well, Ukraine's leader, Vladimir Zelensky, just did an interview with a UK newspaper, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=32.72s)]
*  The Guardian, ahead of a meeting this week with Vice President J.D. Vance. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=37.16s)]
*  Also remember that President Trump said on Friday that he would probably meet Zelensky [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=42.12s)]
*  this week. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=46.2s)]
*  Now, throughout the US presidential campaign, Zelensky heard President Trump claim that [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=47.2s)]
*  he could end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours, although he didn't give too many details about [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=51.92s)]
*  how. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=56.92s)]
*  And of course, so far that hasn't happened. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=57.92s)]
*  But Zelensky also knows that more and more Ukrainians would like a ceasefire. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=59.84s)]
*  A recent poll found that just over half of Ukrainians would now like to see an end to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=64.56s)]
*  the fighting. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=69.44s)]
*  But when we were just in Ukraine, many people told us they only want that if they can have [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=70.44s)]
*  security guarantees as well to stop Russia reinvading their country at a later date. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=74.72s)]
*  And that is really what Zelensky stressed in this interview. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=80.68s)]
*  He said that any security guarantees had to involve the United States, that Europe [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=83.64s)]
*  couldn't do it by itself. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=88.84s)]
*  And Zelensky has long stressed that what he really wants for Ukraine is NATO membership. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=90.8s)]
*  And that would mean that the US, which is a NATO state, would potentially have to come [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=95.5s)]
*  to Ukraine's aid to defend Ukraine if it's attacked again in future. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=99.8s)]
*  Now, look, Zelensky must be worried about some recent comments by President Trump on [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  in which he talked about how much money the US has given to Ukraine to support it and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=109.12s)]
*  said, quote, they may be Russian someday. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  They may not be Russian someday, but we're going to have all this money in there and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=116.72s)]
*  I want it back. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=120.44000000000001s)]
*  Now, that will certainly play into fears in Ukraine that Trump could try to negotiate [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=121.64s)]
*  a deal with Vladimir Putin that redraws the map and hands over parts of Ukraine to Russia. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=126.92s)]
*  In the interviews, Zelensky said he seemed to be kind of appealing to the businessman [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=132.9s)]
*  talking about offering US companies lucrative reconstruction contracts, access to rare earths [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=137.78s)]
*  and investment concessions. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=144.17999999999998s)]
*  So kind of a quid pro quo for US protection. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=145.54s)]
*  Yeah, and those rare earths, those minerals are in what is now that disputed territory. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=148.62s)]
*  So a key component of the overall picture. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=153.12s)]
*  Holly, great to have your update on this important issue. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=155.33999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI5CxMdVnSw&t=158.01999999999998s)]
