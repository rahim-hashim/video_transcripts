**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3lrFZonng)
*  Joining us at the gallery tonight is a young man who truly loves our police. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3lrFZonng&t=0.0s)]
*  His name is DJ Daniel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3lrFZonng&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  He is 13 years old, and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3lrFZonng&t=7.92s)]
*  But in 2018, DJ was diagnosed with brain cancer. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3lrFZonng&t=30.0s)]
*  The doctors gave him five months at most to live. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3lrFZonng&t=57.68s)]
*  That was more than six years ago. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3lrFZonng&t=62.28s)]
*  Since that time, DJ and his dad have been on a quest to make his dream come true, and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3lrFZonng&t=86.64s)]
*  DJ has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer actually a number of times. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3lrFZonng&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  The police love him. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3lrFZonng&t=100.84s)]
*  The police departments love him. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3lrFZonng&t=102.16s)]
*  And tonight, DJ, we're going to do you the biggest honor of them all. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3lrFZonng&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  I am asking our new Secret Service Director, Sean Curran, to officially make you an agent [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3lrFZonng&t=108.84s)]
*  of the United States Secret Service. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3lrFZonng&t=115.96s)]
*  Thank you, DJ. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3lrFZonng&t=145.96s)]
*  DJ's doctors believe his cancer likely came from a chemical he was exposed to when he [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3lrFZonng&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  was younger. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3lrFZonng&t=172.84s)]
*  Since 1975, rates of child cancer have increased by more than 40 percent. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3lrFZonng&t=174.6s)]
*  Reversing this trend is one of the top priorities for our new presidential commission to make [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3lrFZonng&t=181.92s)]
*  America healthy again, chaired by our new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3lrFZonng&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La3lrFZonng&t=194.6s)]
