# Trump calls Zelenskyy a "dictator without elections"
**CBS News:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw)
*  Hello, everyone. I'm Major Garrett in New York. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=0.0s)]

*  Ukrainian President Zelensky says that President Trump [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=5.24s)]
*  is trapped in a, quote, disinformation bubble. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=7.94s)]
*  This after the President of the United States [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=10.88s)]
*  claimed Ukraine was responsible for Russia's invasion. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=12.98s)]
*  Today, Trump, in response to Zelensky, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=17.88s)]
*  called him a dictator in a social media post. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=20.46s)]
*  The back and forth occurring a day after the U.S. and Russia [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=24.060000000000002s)]
*  met to discuss the possible outlines [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=27.1s)]
*  for a peace plan to end the now nearly three-year-old war [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=29.94s)]
*  in Ukraine launched again by Russia. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=34.08s)]

*  that's Doge reversal. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=63.04s)]
*  I want to start tonight with Nancy Cordes, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=65.44s)]
*  who joins us from Miami Beach, Florida, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=66.88s)]
*  where President Trump is expected to speak soon, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=68.42s)]
*  and when he does, Nancy will have to bow out of that. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=71.02s)]
*  So, for as long as we have you, Nancy, Ukraine, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=73.72s)]
*  the President Zelensky. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=77.92s)]
*  It's quite a story today, as it was yesterday. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=79.38s)]
*  And I don't think that story is over, Major. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=83.32s)]
*  These two men keep writing new chapters. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=86.64s)]
*  The scathing posts that President Trump wrote [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=88.94s)]
*  about Zelensky today really was an escalation [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=92.68s)]
*  in this war of words. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=96.66000000000001s)]
*  As you pointed out, he called him a dick. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=97.88000000000001s)]
*  President Trump called Zelensky a dictator. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=100.62s)]
*  He said he was doing a terrible job. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  He said that he needs to take a deal sooner rather than later [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=105.10000000000001s)]
*  or he won't have a country anymore. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=109.7s)]
*  It was a really surprising set of accusations [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=112.24s)]
*  when most US allies would agree that Zelensky [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=116.94s)]
*  and the country that he leads, Ukraine, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=121.32s)]
*  have been the victims in this situation [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=123.52s)]
*  and that they were attacked by Russia. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=126.6s)]
*  What Trump was responding to was the fact [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  that Zelensky had accused Trump of essentially swimming [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=132.16s)]
*  in a sea of misinformation after Trump said [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=135.84s)]
*  that Zelensky was a leader with extremely low approval ratings, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=139.28s)]
*  hovering around 4%, who was imposing martial law [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=145.56s)]
*  when he needed to get back to democracy [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=149.28s)]
*  without recognizing that Ukraine only imposed martial law [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  when it came under attack in 2022. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=155.04s)]
*  So where this leads, nobody really knows. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  In the words of one European official today, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=161.23999999999998s)]
*  we really don't know exactly what the US position is. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=164.38s)]
*  They said they don't know how to understand it [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=168.96s)]
*  because it's so different from what they have been hearing [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=170.52s)]
*  just a few months ago. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  And Nancy, just for the audience's benefit, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=174.6s)]
*  there was an election in Ukraine in 2019. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=176.44s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky won, that was 75% of the vote, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=179.08s)]
*  defeating the sitting incumbent Petro Poroshenko, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=181.68s)]
*  who got 25% of the vote. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  There was also an election in Russia in 2024 [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  in which Vladimir Putin won 88% of the vote. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=191.36s)]
*  Because Alexei Navalny and other leading opposition figures [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  were disallowed from having access to the ballot [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=195.36s)]
*  through all sorts of technicalities arranged by whom? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=199.72s)]
*  Sitting President Putin. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=202.32s)]
*  You can answer for yourself, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=204.38s)]
*  which of those two scenarios sounds more [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  like a dictatorship? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  Nancy, what event are you at? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=210.56s)]
*  And as I understand it, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=212.36s)]
*  there is a Saudi Sovereign Wealth Fund related to it? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=213.32s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=218.52s)]
*  This is a summit that is put on every year [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=219.36s)]
*  by the Saudi Public Investment Fund [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=222.8s)]
*  led by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=225.28s)]
*  It's typically a summit major that brings together [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=227.36s)]
*  leaders of industry, investors, Middle Eastern luminaries [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=231.52s)]
*  to talk about investments in the years to come. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  You don't typically see current public officials speaking [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=240.72000000000003s)]
*  at this conference in Miami Beach, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=244.4s)]
*  certainly not the President of the United States, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=247.42000000000002s)]
*  but President Trump is someone who we know [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=249.38000000000002s)]
*  has very close ties to the Saudi. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=251.98000000000002s)]
*  This investment fund that you mentioned is the same fund [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  that put $2 billion into Jared Kushner's private equity firm [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=258.34s)]
*  after President Trump left the White House the first time. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=263.26s)]
*  We know that the Trump Organization has been looking [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=267.7s)]
*  to expand its real estate holdings in Saudi Arabia [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=270.9s)]
*  that Live Golf, which is again run by the same investment [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  firm, has held many of its tournaments at Trump golf courses. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=278.94s)]
*  So there are very close economic ties. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=284.42s)]
*  And then of course there are these growing diplomatic ties. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=288.9s)]
*  We just saw yesterday that striking scene of Marco Rubio, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=292.62s)]
*  the Secretary of State sitting down [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=296.46s)]
*  with his Russian counterpart to talk about ending the war. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=297.98s)]
*  Where did they do that? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=301.58s)]
*  In Saudi Arabia. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=302.86s)]
*  So it is leading to some questions about [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=304.26s)]
*  where President Trump's diplomatic ties [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=306.9s)]
*  with Saudi Arabia begin [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=310.22s)]
*  where his financial interests end. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=311.65999999999997s)]
*  But it'll be interesting to see what he has to say [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=314.35999999999996s)]
*  about those Saudi relations here at this conference [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=317.08s)]
*  in Florida. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=321.18s)]
*  Crucial questions indeed. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=322.58s)]
*  Nancy Cortez, thank you so very much. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQDtaeucUWw&t=324.06s)]
