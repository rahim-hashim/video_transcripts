# Ukraine says Moscow launched over 100 drones overnight
**CBS News:** [March 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkFZnXD5hl4)
*  That fiery White House exchange we all witness has raised serious doubts that the end of Russia's war on Ukraine is near. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkFZnXD5hl4&t=0.0s)]
*  Overnight, Ukraine said it destroyed more than 100 drones Moscow launched at several targets, which includes a medical facility in Kharkiv. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkFZnXD5hl4&t=7.0s)]
*  Now consider this, the war has left three-quarters of a million Ukrainians and Russians dead or wounded. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkFZnXD5hl4&t=15.8s)]
*  But the Ukrainian people are rallying behind President Zelensky and reminding the world that Russia is the aggressor. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkFZnXD5hl4&t=21.8s)]
*  MTSiab has more on this from Ukraine. MTS, good morning. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkFZnXD5hl4&t=28.6s)]
*  Errol, very good morning to you. And following that extraordinary shouting match at the Oval Office, people and politicians across this war-battered country have come out in support of President Vladimir Zelensky, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkFZnXD5hl4&t=35.2s)]
*  saying that he stood up to two of the most powerful men in the world to defend Ukraine, Ukrainian people, and defend the dignity of this country. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkFZnXD5hl4&t=47.6s)]
*  A country which has suffered so terribly since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion three years ago. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkFZnXD5hl4&t=58.4s)]
*  But it has to be said there is also a deep sense of uncertainty and even fear here. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkFZnXD5hl4&t=65.4s)]
*  Ukrainians know how important having close ties with the U.S. is. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkFZnXD5hl4&t=71.4s)]
*  They know how much aid they've received from the American people, whether it's weapons, humanitarian or diplomatic support. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkFZnXD5hl4&t=75.4s)]
*  And so when President Zelensky was accused at the White House of not showing enough thanks, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkFZnXD5hl4&t=83.4s)]
*  I think what struck me as someone who has covered this war from the very beginning is that of the many, many Ukrainians we've spoken to over the years, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkFZnXD5hl4&t=88.4s)]
*  they have almost unanimously told us of the gratitude they have to the U.S. and to the American people. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkFZnXD5hl4&t=97.4s)]
*  So for this relationship, appearing to have broken down so publicly, so dramatically, and so quickly, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkFZnXD5hl4&t=103.4s)]
*  the fear here is all this does is play directly into the hands of Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkFZnXD5hl4&t=110.4s)]
*  Errol. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkFZnXD5hl4&t=116.4s)]
*  Alright, MTS, thank you for that. We appreciate your reporting from the ground there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkFZnXD5hl4&t=117.4s)]
