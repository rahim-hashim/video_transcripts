# Jeffries warns major Medicaid cuts are coming with budget plan
**CBS News:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4)
*  Congressman from the Department of Government Efficiency or Doge Caucus meeting with Elon Musk today, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=0.0s)]
*  as Doge faces a lot of criticism about their methods of firing government employees. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=6.4s)]
*  Well, meanwhile, the Senate Banking Committee holding a hearing on nominees for the future [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=11.36s)]
*  Commerce Undersecretary. The Senate Armed Services also meeting to confirm Navy Secretary nominee [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=15.76s)]
*  John Phelan. And House Speaker Mike Johnson signals a possible announcement about that [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=21.52s)]
*  2025 budget plan after he met with President Donald Trump last night. What a week it's already [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=26.24s)]
*  been on that front. Mr. Johnson says he believes both House and Senate Republicans are now on the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=31.36s)]
*  same page about President Trump's agenda. It's been kind of rocky getting there. Here's House [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. The Republican budget will set in motion the largest cut to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=41.44s)]
*  Medicaid in American history. Children will be hurt. Families will be hurt. Seniors will be hurt. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=49.92s)]
*  Everyday Americans with disabilities will be hurt. Hospitals will be hurt. And nursing homes [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  will be hurt all across America. CBS News congressional correspondent Nidia Kovatsos joins us [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=67.04s)]
*  now. Nidia, yesterday during his cabinet meeting to the press, the president said, read my lips, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=74.72s)]
*  Medicaid won't be touched. So how do we square what Mr. Jeffries had to say with what the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=79.36s)]
*  president said yesterday? Read, it's been a very busy week here on Capitol Hill and it's been a [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=85.12s)]
*  complicated situation because on one hand we can say that Speaker Johnson was very successful in [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=92.56s)]
*  gathering his House Republicans and putting forth a budget plan which is essentially going to be a [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=98.4s)]
*  blueprint as to how much is going to be allocated for spending and how much is going to be [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=103.92s)]
*  allocated for cuts. But this raises concerns amongst both Republicans and Democrats that this [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=108.88s)]
*  is going to essentially equate to cuts with Medicaid given the amount of money, the math makes sense, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=114.56s)]
*  that the cuts will have to come from cuts in Medicaid to be able to afford Trump's tax cuts [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=120.24s)]
*  and being able to put forth his legislative agenda. So on one hand we have many Republicans, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=125.28s)]
*  Speaker Johnson and Trump saying that there won't necessarily be major cuts to Medicaid, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=130.96s)]
*  but then you also have Democrats who are raising the alarm and saying that the cuts will affect [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=135.68s)]
*  their constituents back home and it's also a concern to many Republican lawmakers have that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=140.56s)]
*  when they go back home to their districts they're going to have constituents who are going to want [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=145.36s)]
*  answers and we know that Medicaid of course covers from children to people with disabilities and it's [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=149.6s)]
*  thousands and thousands of their constituents who end up benefiting from Medicaid and so much of the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=154.96s)]
*  backlash here from the budget plunders proposed this week and put forward centers around Medicaid [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=160.64s)]
*  cuts. Well and that is a fascinating conversation to say to say the least because I just heard Steve [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=166.55999999999997s)]
*  Bannon, former Trump advisor, backer of President Donald Trump saying don't touch Medicaid because [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=172.64s)]
*  there are so many voters who will show up at that town hall meeting. That'll be fascinating to see. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=178.0s)]
*  I want to also ask about this the Doge Caucus is meeting with Elon Musk today. What do we know [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=183.04s)]
*  about that meeting? At this moment we're still awaiting details but we know that the Doge Caucus [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=187.6s)]
*  was initially created as an extension of Doge the executive from coming from the executive action [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=195.2s)]
*  and this is a way to gain insight into what exactly is going on with these cuts with reducing the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=200.88s)]
*  workforce. We know that amongst many lawmakers there's a lot of excitement enthusiasm with these [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=205.92s)]
*  cuts and what Doge is intended to do but there's a lot of questions too and so we're going to be [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  awaiting details as to what exactly was discussed and was discussed in these meetings but we know [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=216.64s)]
*  of course and much of it has to send around Medicaid because as we mentioned earlier it's [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=221.92s)]
*  both Democrats and Republicans who have concerns about how much exactly is Medicaid going to be [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=226.88s)]
*  affected how many cuts and who exactly is this going to end up affecting and we know that it's [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=232.32s)]
*  their constituents that want answers and given that health care is such a major major issue [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  amongst Americans we know that it's not going to be such an easy battle for these lawmakers. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=243.12s)]
*  Yeah tens of millions of Americans on Medicaid and all of them are voters. Nidhi Kavatsas thank you [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=248.88s)]
*  so much for that conversation be well in our nation's capital today. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2BI3vFfwU4&t=254.0s)]
