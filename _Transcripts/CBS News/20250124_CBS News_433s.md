# Will Hegseth survive full Senate vote for confirmation?
**CBS News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs)
*  We're also watching shifting political winds in our nation's capital, all eyes on Capitol [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=0.0s)]
*  Hill. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=4.8s)]
*  And the big question, whether President Trump's pick, Pete Hegseth, for defense secretary, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=5.8s)]
*  will get enough confirmation votes to get the job. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=9.64s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader John Thune saying Trump will get his cabinet even if it means that [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=12.8s)]
*  lawmakers have to stay, stay it out, and work through the weekend. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  So as voting relates to Mr. Hegseth, that confirmation vote, we understand, will happen [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=21.72s)]
*  later tonight. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=26.64s)]
*  We also wanted to let you hear Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had some blistering remarks [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=27.92s)]
*  ahead of that vote plan for tonight. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=32.34s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=34.96s)]
*  Is Pete Hegseth really the best we have to lead the greatest military in the world? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=35.96s)]
*  Is this man with a history of excessive drinking really the guy you want on the other end of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=41.96s)]
*  the phone at 2 a.m. in a crisis in control of the nuclear codes? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=48.160000000000004s)]
*  Is this man with a mile-long list of allegations of abusing, degrading, and harassing women [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=53.76s)]
*  the one we want, leading our men and women into battle? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  Is this man who failed to manage the finances of veterans' nonprofit groups, who drove [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=63.92s)]
*  his organizations into debt to the point where he could not even pay creditors the person [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=69.5s)]
*  we want in charge of the Pentagon's budget? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=75.7s)]
*  I want this last point to sink in. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=78.68s)]
*  DOD is a colossal organization. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=80.32s)]
*  It has a workforce of 3 million people, an annual budget of over $850 billion. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=83.36s)]
*  Is Pete Hegseth really the person we want overseeing an organization as complex as DOD? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=89.68s)]
*  A man who couldn't even manage the finances of a small nonprofit, and yet they pick him? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  Is Pete Hegseth the best man for the job? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=104.12s)]
*  If that's sounding familiar, bringing in CBS News' Caitlin Hewitt Burns, it does, because [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=107.0s)]
*  we heard Hakeem Jeffries say arguably the same thing in recent days. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=111.52s)]
*  You also have some reporting on Senator Tim Kaine. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=116.6s)]
*  Hey, great to see you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=119.8s)]
*  Well, there's actually not a lot that Democrats can do to stop this nomination from going [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=122.64s)]
*  forward. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=127.92s)]
*  If you look at the first procedural vote the other night, only two Republicans defected, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=128.92s)]
*  and that gives you an indication that this nomination is likely to go through, though [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=135.16s)]
*  we are watching that final vote, which could come later tonight. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=140.72s)]
*  You mentioned Tim Kaine. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=144.0s)]
*  He's been meeting with some Democrats, and he said, he sits on this committee, he said [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=145.12s)]
*  that they've been trying to pitch a deal where they offer an earlier vote for Hegseth in [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=148.8s)]
*  exchange for delaying some of these other votes on nominees, like Kristi Noem and others, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=154.64s)]
*  pushing that until Monday. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=160.4s)]
*  Now, we'll see if Republicans bite on that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=162.32s)]
*  It could be unlikely given that Republicans are incentivized to stay through the weekend, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  try to move as many nominees forward in the process as possible, because they want the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=171.68s)]
*  president and his nominees to hit the ground running on their agenda. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  But that is a proposal being floated an earlier, perhaps earlier than 9 p.m. vote. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=182.52s)]
*  Of course, for this Capitol Hill reporter would be welcomed. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=187.28s)]
*  Yes, you might actually get a dinner time before the stroke of midnight. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=190.24s)]
*  So there's this reporting that Pete Hegseth has told lawmakers behind closed doors that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=194.68s)]
*  he in fact did pay $50,000 to the woman who accused him of sexual assault in 2017. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=200.32s)]
*  We have to say he still continues to deny any wrongdoing. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  But is this revelation likely why we saw that erosion of support from Murkowski and Collins [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=209.68s)]
*  saying that they will vote no? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=216.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, this was certainly news because we knew that a payment existed. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=218.16s)]
*  We did not know until yesterday when that was disclosed what the amount was. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=223.96s)]
*  And Hegseth has maintained his innocence. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=229.08s)]
*  He has argued before we knew what this number was that they offered that payment a long [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=231.32000000000002s)]
*  time after this incident because they were worried essentially about his job at Fox News [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  at the time. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  Does it have any bearing on the Republicans that are influential here? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=244.66s)]
*  in but largely from Murkowski and Collins had bigger, broader issues with his nomination [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=250.16s)]
*  and could not support moving forward with that process. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=256.48s)]
*  The key to watch here is if any other Republicans join in on this. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=260.92s)]
*  Again, it's unlikely, but they could, you know, support the procedural vote to move [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=266.12s)]
*  forward with this nomination and then oppose him. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=271.36s)]
*  You heard President Trump himself say today maybe Mitch McConnell doesn't vote for him. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=274.08s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=278.72s)]
*  So we will see. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=279.72s)]
*  Nothing, you know, is true until that vote does close. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=280.92s)]
*  But it is unlikely that you'll see many more Republican defections and more likely than [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  not that Hegseth is the next defense secretary. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=289.92s)]
*  I echo what you say. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=293.04s)]
*  I thought it was fascinating when Donald Trump gets off of Air Force One in North Carolina [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=294.04s)]
*  and he's asking reporters, what about Mitch? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=297.56s)]
*  How did Mitch vote? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  It did plant a seed in a lot of us. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=301.04s)]
*  Like, is Mitch McConnell's vote up for question here? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=303.08000000000004s)]
*  So we know you're there. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=305.76000000000005s)]
*  We know you can cover it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=307.06s)]
*  We also know that you know a lot about something called recess appointments, which basically [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=308.06s)]
*  means the president can make appointments that are temporary when the Senate is not [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=313.18s)]
*  in session. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=317.06s)]
*  Want to get your take? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=318.06s)]
*  We heard about the possibility of recess appointments to fast track these pick for cabinet confirmations. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=319.06s)]
*  What are you hearing by way of recess appointments and could that play out? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=325.18s)]
*  Yeah, this new administration provides some civic lessons for all of us. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=329.34000000000003s)]
*  So we have been brushing up on procedure uphill here up here on Capitol Hill. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=334.18s)]
*  This is pretty unlikely because it would require a lot. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=338.34s)]
*  Essentially both houses, if the president wants to put Congress in recess, both houses [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=342.62s)]
*  of Congress, both chambers would have to agree. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=348.23999999999995s)]
*  And that means the Senate would have to have 60 votes to support a recess, going into recess [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=351.17999999999995s)]
*  for that appointment to take place. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=357.0s)]
*  Republicans have control over the Senate, but they don't have 60 votes. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=359.65999999999997s)]
*  So that would require Democrats. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=362.82s)]
*  That's unlikely at this point. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=364.62s)]
*  So there are some procedural kind of fundamental hurdles for that as well. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=366.02s)]
*  But by and large, what President Trump was suggesting is he wants nominees, not only [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=370.58s)]
*  those top cabinet level positions that we've been talking about, but other, you know, deputies [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=375.14s)]
*  and other kind of agency heads to be confirmed as quickly as possible. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=379.88s)]
*  So he has kind of floated this idea around and essentially said it's up to majority leader [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=384.12s)]
*  John Thune in the Senate to really make that plan. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=389.34s)]
*  But there is also this argument to be made that you want your confirmation, you want [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=392.90000000000003s)]
*  the full confirmation process for your nominees to show publicly what the support is, show [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=397.86s)]
*  the vetting publicly and have that formal process so that there aren't any questions [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=404.0s)]
*  at least that haven't been answered yet at that time about these nominees. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=409.42s)]
*  So we'll see, never say never in a Trump administration. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=413.32s)]
*  But there are some big hurdles that exist with that. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=417.54s)]
*  Alright, so once again, the vote on Pete Hegsat, that confirmation vote set for 9 p.m. Eastern. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=420.14000000000004s)]
*  But if Democrats are able to cut that deal, move up the vote, you get dinner on a Friday. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=425.22s)]
*  Caitlin, it's so nice to talk to you. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=430.46000000000004s)]
*  We appreciate you so much. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SjomBXJGs&t=431.86s)]
