# Loved ones awaited passengers as plane collided in D.C.
**CBS News:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg)
*  Hi everyone. Thanks for joining us here on CBS News 24-7. I'm Lindsay Reiser. We continue to cover [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=0.0s)]
*  the tragedy just outside our nation's capital, the first commercial airline disaster in the U.S. in 16 [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=5.36s)]
*  years. Search and recovery efforts are underway in Washington after that deadly crash between a [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=12.0s)]
*  military aircraft and a regional American Airlines plane last night. While emergency crews are [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=17.2s)]
*  searching the Potomac River to find the crash victims, we are going to show you video now, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=22.88s)]
*  courtesy of EarthCam, that shows the moment of the collision. The jet was on course, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=26.96s)]
*  approaching Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Virginia, coming from Wichita, Kansas. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  60 passengers were believed to be on board the American Airlines flight, along with four crew [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=37.68s)]
*  members. Three soldiers are said to have been on board the military helicopter. Officials say [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=42.24s)]
*  roughly 30 bodies have been recovered so far, including all three soldiers. This is radar video [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  from the control tower as crews monitor the situation. It shows the two closing in on one [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=54.64s)]
*  another before the crash. The president spoke to the tragedy earlier today. The work has now [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=60.8s)]
*  shifted to a recovery mission. Sadly, there are no survivors. This was a dark and excruciating night [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=67.2s)]
*  in our nation's capital and in our nation's history, and a tragedy of terrible proportions. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=77.04s)]
*  As one nation, we grieve for every precious soul that has been taken from us so suddenly, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=84.48s)]
*  and we are a country of really, we are in mourning. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  Skyler Henry is at Reagan National Airport, which reopened just a few hours ago. Skyler, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=97.12s)]
*  where do things stand in the investigation? Right, Lindsey. Well, the NTSB is leading [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=101.44000000000001s)]
*  this investigation. We actually anticipate hearing from them during a press conference [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=109.36s)]
*  later on in this hour. We heard from officials earlier today who have described what it has been [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=113.84s)]
*  like in this recovery mission and their efforts as they have worked through the night, hours, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  trying to get through the records to see if there were at the time any survivors. Now, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=124.64s)]
*  as you heard from President Trump in the briefing room there, this is now a recovery mission. They [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=129.36s)]
*  say that because of what the conditions were at that time and where they stand today, it is [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=134.8s)]
*  certainly very difficult for anyone to survive. We know that people, or we know that crews say [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=140.16000000000003s)]
*  that they have recovered at least 30 bodies. D.C.'s Mayor, Mirro Bouser, told our Nicole Skanga [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=146.16000000000003s)]
*  earlier today on CBS News 24-7 that they will continue to work until all of those bodies are [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=153.52s)]
*  recovered. They also talked about what it has been like trying to console the families here who [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=160.24s)]
*  were waiting. Remember, this flight was minutes away from landing here at Reagan National Airport, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=164.88s)]
*  and so there are countless family members here that were supposed to be picking up their loved [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=170.32000000000002s)]
*  ones and take them back to their respective homes and locations. And so now this is not only a [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=174.88s)]
*  recovery effort, but also one where this community in this area is trying to wrap their arms around [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=180.24s)]
*  all of these families that are looking for answers, trying to figure out where to go, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  what to do, how to get any sort of support, because this is something that obviously was [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=190.39999999999998s)]
*  not expected, but also they don't know what to do next. Obviously these bodies are being recovered, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=195.76s)]
*  but we're also still looking for answers as to how something like this has happened. We know that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=202.72s)]
*  this is what officials have referred to as a congested airspace, in that there is commercial [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=207.2s)]
*  aircraft that come to this location, military aircraft that come to this location, but there [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=212.32s)]
*  are also several operations training missions that happen throughout the day and throughout, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=217.2s)]
*  it's relatively normal having lived here in Washington, D.C., and so to see something like [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=223.2s)]
*  this happen, to know the work that air traffic control has to do in order to make sure that this [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=227.28s)]
*  place runs smoothly, there are certainly a lot of questions that members of the Trump administration, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=232.4s)]
*  that includes Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, as well as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=236.88s)]
*  others, say that they want to get to the bottom. What do we know about the victims? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=241.44s)]
*  Well, we're learning a little bit more. We know that there were several high-profile figure skaters [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=248.72s)]
*  that were on board, both U.S. nationals as well as Russian nationals. In fact, President Trump [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=253.76s)]
*  spoke about that during that briefing earlier today. He also said that several other [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=259.92s)]
*  international flyers were on board that regional jet as well. He was yet to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=264.8s)]
*  release or announce where or what those countries may be. But we are also hearing from several other [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  civic groups. We've heard from union members who say that some of their members were on board this [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=277.44s)]
*  flight as well. Yet to release any official names at this point, but in the hours following this [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=282.8s)]
*  incident, we know that this is something that is impacting not only those in Kansas, but people [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=290.48s)]
*  here in the Washington, D.C. area and obviously an international perspective as well. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=294.96s)]
*  Skyler, we did hear from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and a video message posted to [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  social media earlier today. Let's listen to that. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=304.32s)]
*  It was a fairly experienced crew and it was doing a required annual night evaluation. They did have [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=309.35999999999996s)]
*  night vision goggles. The 12th Aviation Battalion, as of now, was granted a 48-hour operational pause [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=317.52s)]
*  on contingency missions as what happened is reviewed. Now he was also with the president [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=325.76s)]
*  this afternoon calling this unacceptable, saying that they will get to the bottom of it. And he [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=331.76s)]
*  echoed the president's comments, which we will get into a bit more with Nancy Cordes, that DEI, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=335.76s)]
*  diversity, equity, inclusion, has no place in government, said all employees must be colorblind [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=340.79999999999995s)]
*  and merit-based, naming air traffic controllers specifically. There's no evidence at this time [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=345.84s)]
*  suggesting the DEI initiatives played a role, but what else did Secretary Hegseth say? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=350.0s)]
*  Well, he emphasized again that the service members who were on board that Black Hawk were [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=358.56s)]
*  experienced. This, although it was a training exercise, did not and should not indicate the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=363.92s)]
*  fact that they were inexperienced fliers at all. In fact, that this was a practice routine mission [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=369.52s)]
*  to nearby Fort Belvoir in Virginia, and this was something that they do on an annual basis. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=375.91999999999996s)]
*  And though that they were flying at nighttime, they had their nighttime goggles as well, but [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=382.23999999999995s)]
*  also said that these were experienced military service members. And so he also wanted to stress [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=387.91999999999996s)]
*  that point. But again, the big question is what happened with that communication? Where did it [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=394.4s)]
*  fall off between air traffic control and the Black Hawk? Many are still trying to figure out [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=400.24s)]
*  exactly what might have happened, because remember, as I pointed out, that regional jet was just [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=405.04s)]
*  moments away from landing here at Reagan. And so many questions are out there as to whether there [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=409.44s)]
*  was any sort of mistakes that were made by the service members on board of that Black Hawk, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=415.12s)]
*  or if there was something that could be done to improve the line of communication between air [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=419.68s)]
*  traffic control and those who are on board both aircraft. Skylar Henry, thank you. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLhFBXmZwzg&t=423.68s)]
