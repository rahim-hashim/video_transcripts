# Jimmy Carter's personal pastor remembers former president
**CBS News:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk)
*  I just want to bring in now by phone President Carter's personal pastor, Tony Loudon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=0.0s)]
*  He is in the motorcade right now with the Carter family. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  And Tony, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=10.76s)]
*  I know you were the personal pastor for the Carters for six years. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=13.92s)]
*  Talk about what you learned from the former president. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=18.44s)]
*  I think the biggest thing that I learned was the fact that it's not for self but for country. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=22.6s)]
*  It was all about serving this nation all the way to the end. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=29.98s)]
*  Every time I would go to visit him, he would ask me three, four questions. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=34.38s)]
*  Where have you been? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=38.7s)]
*  What have you done? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=40.1s)]
*  Who have you helped? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=41.1s)]
*  And how can I help you help them? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  And some days when he would have bad days and he wasn't feeling well, he would just [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=44.82s)]
*  say, where have you been? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=49.58s)]
*  And I know that he wanted to ask all four questions. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=52.86s)]
*  So I have to answer all four questions to him. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=55.18s)]
*  He's one of the greatest serving leaders ever met in my entire life. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=58.62s)]
*  That's moving. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=63.26s)]
*  Very emotional to hear you say that story so focused on the other. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=64.26s)]
*  I know he changed your life. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=68.18s)]
*  How did he inspire you? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=70.7s)]
*  He forced me to take it to the next level. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=73.98s)]
*  As ministers and preachers and people who believe in their faith, a lot of times we [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=76.78s)]
*  put it on display in church and Bible study. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=82.02s)]
*  He wanted what you learn to go outside the walls of the church, not discriminate against [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=85.17999999999999s)]
*  people, not use Christianity as a way to hate other people, but look at ways of saying faith [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=90.53999999999999s)]
*  without works is dead, been alone. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=96.22s)]
*  Loving people, honoring people, loving your neighbors, caring about those who are downtrodden, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=99.17999999999999s)]
*  even those who may not vote for you, but find a way to be able to show them compassion. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=104.94s)]
*  And he just, I no longer look at life the way I used to. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=113.62s)]
*  I look at it as a way that my life belongs to our nation in this world to serve. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=119.38000000000001s)]
*  And I hope that those that are celebrating his life today, that today is not just a celebration, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=125.62s)]
*  but our nation. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=131.68s)]
*  We pick up the mantle. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  We pick up the legacy of Jimmy Carter and we take it to the next level. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=134.32s)]
*  So beautifully said. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=140.98000000000002s)]
*  What do you think about the service we're about to witness? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=142.01999999999998s)]
*  Yesterday, I had an opportunity to do a walkthrough through the National Cathedral. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=144.17999999999998s)]
*  And I just hope that our nation, our people get an opportunity to see this great celebration [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=151.45999999999998s)]
*  of this man's life. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=156.82s)]
*  But more importantly, our nation has come together, both Republicans, Democrats, independents, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=158.45999999999998s)]
*  our leaders who have come before him, presidents before him, our Supreme Court justices all [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=165.82s)]
*  in the same building honoring this great man. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=174.29999999999998s)]
*  But more importantly, I think that's God and Jimmy Carter got together to decide that we [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  can do this right before we select our leaders. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=185.06s)]
*  We can do this right before we have our inauguration. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=188.74s)]
*  We can do this right before we have a transitional of our government so that we can put faith [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=191.58s)]
*  and hope on display in our nation. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=196.98000000000002s)]
*  So that our nation can have confidence in our government. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=200.54000000000002s)]
*  Make our nation truly a great place where we help others and be the shining light that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=205.98000000000002s)]
*  we've always been in this nation. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=210.9s)]
*  Of course, he taught Sunday school himself, and he spoke the word of God. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=214.3s)]
*  But he practiced the faith, too. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=221.9s)]
*  Describe how he did that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=224.62s)]
*  You know, I remember when he fell one day right before he was supposed to go to Tennessee [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=226.18s)]
*  to do his Habitat Bill. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=234.5s)]
*  And the Secret Service and staff told me to go into the hospital and tell him he shouldn't [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=238.18s)]
*  go to Tennessee. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=242.86s)]
*  But as I got there, went into the room, I said, President Carter, I don't think you [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=244.98000000000002s)]
*  should go to Tennessee to build. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=249.34s)]
*  He said, listen, Tony, hospitals are just like prisons. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=251.34s)]
*  They're easy to get into and hard to get out. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=255.54000000000002s)]
*  I need you to help me get out of this hospital so that I can keep my word and go build homes [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=257.66s)]
*  for those who need homes. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=265.42s)]
*  And the most amazing thing about all that, he had this big bandage on his eye over his [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=266.90000000000003s)]
*  eye, and he had a black eye. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=272.74s)]
*  And he was determined to get to Tennessee, to keep his word. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=274.94s)]
*  And I believe that all the years that he put his left hand on the Bible and raised his [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=279.58s)]
*  right hand when he was a state senator, he did the same thing when he was in the Navy. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=285.65999999999997s)]
*  He did the same thing when he was governor of Georgia. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=290.5s)]
*  And he did the same thing when he was president of the United States. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=293.34s)]
*  In his mind and in his spirit, he never took his hand off that Bible because he made a [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=297.02s)]
*  covenant with his gods that he would serve this great nation and serve the world. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=302.85999999999996s)]
*  And that's what he's doing today. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=308.65999999999997s)]
*  The Sunday School teacher has given us a lesson on faith and hope to be the guardrails of [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=309.78s)]
*  our democracy. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=315.82s)]
*  Oh, Reverend Tony Loudon, such an honor and a pleasure to speak with you. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=316.82s)]
*  And thank you for sharing so much about what we can all learn from the former president. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=325.42s)]
*  Our best wishes and prayers with you as well, because I know you are mourning today as well. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=332.38s)]
*  Thank you, Laura. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=337.14000000000004s)]
*  I lost a friend. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=338.14000000000004s)]
*  I lost someone who I love. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=339.14000000000004s)]
*  But we're going to celebrate his life today. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=342.74s)]
*  Thank you, Laura. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=344.66s)]
*  Have a great day. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=345.66s)]
*  I am overcome just because so beautifully put. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFb3hgWeVk&t=348.66s)]
