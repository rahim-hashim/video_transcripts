*  So far, the ceasefire in Gaza is holding, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01fvEYin-4c&t=104.72s)]
*  and so is the one Israel agreed with Lebanon, sort of. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01fvEYin-4c&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  In the past 24 hours, Israeli aircraft have attacked [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01fvEYin-4c&t=112.64s)]
*  what the army described as Hezbollah targets [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01fvEYin-4c&t=115.76s)]
*  near the border with Syria. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01fvEYin-4c&t=118.56s)]
*  Israel has also failed to pull all its troops [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01fvEYin-4c&t=120.68s)]
*  out of Lebanon by January 26th, that is last week, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01fvEYin-4c&t=123.88s)]
*  according to the original agreement. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01fvEYin-4c&t=127.92s)]
*  It's now pushed the deadline forward, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01fvEYin-4c&t=129.68s)]
*  now set for the 18th of February. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01fvEYin-4c&t=132.28s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01fvEYin-4c&t=135.0s)]
*  Liz, thank you for that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01fvEYin-4c&t=136.16s)]
*  Back in October of last year, we spoke with Aviva Siegel. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01fvEYin-4c&t=137.76s)]
*  I just wanna play some of what she shared with us. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01fvEYin-4c&t=141.88s)]
*  I just hope that Kit is strong enough [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01fvEYin-4c&t=145.16s)]
*  and is keeping his hope, and we're waiting for him. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01fvEYin-4c&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  And all the families here are waiting for their loved ones. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01fvEYin-4c&t=150.48000000000002s)]
