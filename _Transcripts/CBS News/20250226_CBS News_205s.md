# Large ICE raid near Houston leads to around 118 arrests
**CBS News:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8)
*  More than 100 migrants arrested [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=0.0s)]
*  during a multi agency raid targeted [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=2.2s)]
*  Operation North of Houston this week. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=4.92s)]
*  I says it targeted the Colony Ridge area, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=7.48s)]
*  which by the way, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=10.68s)]
*  has a large Hispanic population [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=12.3s)]
*  because of quote cartel activity [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=14.24s)]
*  and illegal alien population. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=16.34s)]
*  Again, that is a quote from ice. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=17.96s)]
*  And while the operation had the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=20.6s)]
*  support of Governor Greg Abbott [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=22.72s)]
*  and the developer of Colony Ridge, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  it's left many people there. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=26.84s)]
*  Sadly fearful CBS News national reporter [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=28.68s)]
*  Karen Wa has the details from Houston. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=30.7s)]
*  Karen, thank you so much for joining us today. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=33.12s)]
*  Can you walk us through this operation [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=36.08s)]
*  and exactly who was arrested? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=38.32s)]
*  Yeah, good afternoon Mugo. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=43.12s)]
*  So I'm actually here in the office of Fiel. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  They're a local nonprofit that really [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=47.44s)]
*  helps with immigration rights and they've [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=49.5s)]
*  been working in this colony Ridge [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=51.68s)]
*  neighborhood for over 10 years at this point. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=53.8s)]
*  So they're very connected. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=56.6s)]
*  Very on the ground there. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=57.919999999999995s)]
*  I just interviewed the executive director [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=59.36s)]
*  and from his knowledge from his reports, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=61.48s)]
*  this is what he knows happened. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=64.08s)]
*  He says 118 people were taken to his knowledge. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=66.2s)]
*  All of them were adults. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=69.56s)]
*  No children reported yet, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=71.4s)]
*  and they were mostly male. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=72.92s)]
*  He says while ice and DPS went into some [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=74.6s)]
*  workplaces like tire shops and restaurants [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=78.0s)]
*  to ask for the owners employee identification numbers. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=80.52s)]
*  That's how they took some of the people. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=83.8s)]
*  He says most of the people were actually taken [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  at traffic stops, so either police found a way [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=89.52s)]
*  to say that their tire, their backlight was out [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=93.02s)]
*  or they didn't have a license plate [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=97.16s)]
*  or something of the matter. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  They were stopped because of traffic. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=100.69999999999999s)]
*  And then he says that throughout the course [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=102.74s)]
*  of asking them questions, especially for some folks [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  who didn't speak English fluently, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  that's when their status was revealed [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=110.8s)]
*  in that line of questioning. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=113.89999999999999s)]
*  And say sorry, the director of Fiel says that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=115.72000000000001s)]
*  it very much was a case of folks who didn't know [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  to exercise their fifth amendment rights, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  which is why they answered many of these questions [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  and were ultimately arrested when their status was found out, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=128.68s)]
*  ICE was called and they were taken to a center. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=133.36s)]
*  So Karen, as we mentioned, we know governor Greg Abbott [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=136.52s)]
*  and also the developer of colony Ridge, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=139.96s)]
*  they both supported this raid. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=142.84s)]
*  What are they saying? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=144.92s)]
*  Yeah, so governor Greg Abbott, we reached out to his office [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=148.9s)]
*  and he's not answering any questions so far, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=151.64s)]
*  but we do have a tweet from him. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  He confirms that 118 people were arrested thanks to ICE, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=156.0s)]
*  HSI and the Texas Department of Public Safety. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  And he says, we must remain vigilant [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=162.96s)]
*  about this neighborhood. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=165.22s)]
*  And now the CEO of the colony Ridge development, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=166.6s)]
*  they released a statement to us saying, quote, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=171.28s)]
*  we are grateful for the efforts of governor Abbott [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=174.0s)]
*  from home and in all those involved [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=176.4s)]
*  in rooting out criminal illegals in Texas. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=178.16s)]
*  In fact, DPS officers have been working [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=180.76000000000002s)]
*  throughout colony Ridge for more than two years. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=182.44s)]
*  They know who the bad guys are. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=185.52s)]
*  So we are fully supportive of these efforts. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=186.88s)]
*  We also know that colony Ridge remains [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=189.38s)]
*  one of the safest communities of its size anywhere in Texas. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=191.28s)]
*  And we are proud of our residents and their desire [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  to make this community a vibrant, happy [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=196.68s)]
*  and safe place to live. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=199.10000000000002s)]
*  All right, Karen Wah, thank you so much [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=201.76s)]
*  for your reporting today. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU-TO5oLc8&t=203.51999999999998s)]
