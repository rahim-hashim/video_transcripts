# Trump to speak with Xi Jinping after retaliatory tariffs announced by China
**CBS News:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54)
*  The trade war between the US and China escalated overnight after President Trump's 10% tariff on Chinese imports. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=0.0s)]
*  President Xi Jinping slammed the US with several of its own tariffs. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  Those taxes now set to take effect next Monday. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=12.86s)]
*  Now this all comes after Trump paused his plans for tariffs on Mexico and Canada for at least one month [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  after speaking with leaders from both countries. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  Just moments ago, White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt had this to say about a potential call with President Xi. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=24.66s)]
*  Take a listen to that. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=30.740000000000002s)]
*  I don't have any updates on when that call will take place. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=33.14s)]
*  As you heard from the president yesterday, it is being scheduled and will happen very soon. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=35.66s)]
*  But the president made it very clear with the 10% tariff on China that he is not going to allow China to continue to source and distribute deadly fentanyl into our country. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=40.06s)]
*  That was the reason for this tariff. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=49.900000000000006s)]
*  It was a retaliatory tariff on China for the last four years of their unprecedented distribution of fentanyl into our nation's borders. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=51.620000000000005s)]
*  So when that call happens, we will provide a readout like we always do. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=58.92s)]
*  CBS News Chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes joins us now to help us make sense of all of this. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  Nancy, thank you for joining us. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=68.22s)]
*  The president may speak with President Xi as early as today, but this isn't the first time these two leaders have engaged in a so-called trade war. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=70.12s)]
*  What's at stake here for Americans and the global economy as a whole? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=78.76s)]
*  Well, obviously, China, Liz, is a huge producer of goods that we consume here in the U.S. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=85.02000000000001s)]
*  So any time that we impose tariffs on China or they impose tariffs on us or both, somebody is going to end up paying the price. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=90.46000000000001s)]
*  Some of it will fall to the producers. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=100.16000000000001s)]
*  Some of it will fall to consumers. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=102.82000000000001s)]
*  And so that is why this has become such a huge global issue, because in an era of higher than usual inflation, any time prices are set to go up even more, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=104.86s)]
*  it is a concern for economists, for world leaders, for consumers like you and me, for everybody. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=119.66s)]
*  And so that's why what is happening right now is being so closely watched. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=126.46s)]
*  These 10 percent tariffs that the president imposed on Chinese goods went into effect at midnight. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=131.32000000000002s)]
*  And China retaliated by saying, OK, well, next Monday, we're going to impose a bunch of tariffs on U.S. goods, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=138.20000000000002s)]
*  15 percent tariffs on coal and liquefied natural gas products, plus a 10 percent tariff on U.S. crude oil, agricultural machinery, large engine cars. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=146.12s)]
*  Now, as you said, Caroline Levitt says there is some kind of conversation that is going to take place soon between President Trump and President Xi. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=156.86s)]
*  Yesterday, she said it was going to happen today. Now it appears that's up in the air. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=165.7s)]
*  And so the question is, will they be able to work out some kind of deal along the lines of what we saw yesterday where President Trump struck agreements [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=170.22s)]
*  with the presidents of Mexico, the prime minister of Canada in order to head off those tariffs? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=180.14s)]
*  All right, we're going to be keeping a close eye on that this week, Nancy. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=187.44s)]
*  But also happening today, President Trump scheduled to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House where you are right now. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=189.95999999999998s)]
*  The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, no doubt, will be top of mind in these discussions. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=197.72s)]
*  Do we have any details about the schedule of this meeting and what the two leaders will discuss? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=201.83999999999997s)]
*  Yes, so they are supposed to sit down later this afternoon to meet for about an hour. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=209.34s)]
*  This is the first major world leader that President Trump is going to be meeting with here at the White House since taking office after his re-election. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=214.86s)]
*  And then they are holding a joint press conference. So they will speak to members of the press here at the White House. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=223.34s)]
*  And then they're having dinner together. So there'll be a lot of time to talk about how the implementation of phase one of this ceasefire is going, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=229.38s)]
*  where a couple of dozen Israeli hostages are being released by Hamas, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=238.28s)]
*  where the Israelis have agreed to cease their bombardment of Gaza. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  And then they'll look ahead to phase two. What are the challenges there? How is it going to work? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  Phase two is supposed to involve the release of all of the rest of the Israeli hostages. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=258.8s)]
*  Hamas has said they won't do that unless they get assurances that the war is indeed coming to an end permanently. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=263.46000000000004s)]
*  And so there's still a lot to be worked out to ensure that that goes forward as planned. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=271.46000000000004s)]
*  And Nancy, we're also following Secretary of State Marco Rubio's first international trip. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=277.46000000000004s)]
*  Moments ago, he arrived in Costa Rica for a meet and greet with U.S. Embassy and staff. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=282.46000000000004s)]
*  But the major announcement came out of his meeting with El Salvador's president last night involving the future of migrants deported from the U.S. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=287.56s)]
*  What do we learn there? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=296.56s)]
*  This is really remarkable, Liz. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=299.56s)]
*  The president of El Salvador not only agreed to take deportees, people that the U.S. is sending out of the country because they're in the U.S. illegally, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=302.56s)]
*  not only people who are originally from El Salvador, but people who are from other countries too that perhaps the U.S. doesn't have an agreement with [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=314.66s)]
*  so we can't fly deportees and land those planes in those countries and send them back to their own home countries. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=321.66s)]
*  The president of El Salvador saying to Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, sure, we'll take them here and in fact we'll do you one better. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=330.66s)]
*  We'll even take your U.S. criminals, your American citizens who are convicted criminals in U.S. jails right now. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=337.76000000000005s)]
*  We will happily house them in our mega prison for a fee. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=346.76000000000005s)]
*  This sort of shocked and alarmed some human rights activists who say that's not legal. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=351.76000000000005s)]
*  You can't just deport American citizens out of the country whether they are a criminal or not. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=358.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, that would be interesting to see the developments on that, Nancy. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=365.86s)]
*  Before you go though, I have to ask you about this. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=368.86s)]
*  The U.S. Agency for International Development remains closed today. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=370.86s)]
*  We just saw some major protests outside those buildings yesterday. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=374.86s)]
*  Can you walk us through what happens next with this department and its employees? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=378.86s)]
*  Sure. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=384.86s)]
*  So what the Trump administration says is going to happen next is that USAID, which has been its own independent agency for more than half a century, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=385.86s)]
*  is going to be folded into the U.S. State Department and the secretary of state Marco Rubio is essentially going to take over USAID as well. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=394.96000000000004s)]
*  It is going to shrink dramatically but it will still carry out its mission of delivering humanitarian aid around the world just with a smaller footprint. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=404.96000000000004s)]
*  The reason you're seeing protests and the reason Democrats are so up in arms is because they say you don't have the authority to do that, Mr. President. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=415.96000000000004s)]
*  This is an agency that was created by federal statute and you need the approval of Congress if you want to eliminate an agency or merge it with another one. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=424.06s)]
*  So that is the standoff that's taking place right now as USAID headquarters here in Washington, D.C. is shut down to workers for a second day. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=435.06s)]
*  We simply don't know exactly how all of this is going to play out, Liz. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=445.06s)]
*  All right, Nancy Cordes, live from the White House. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=448.06s)]
*  Thank you so much for that reporting on all of those different topics. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcwon5kO54&t=451.06s)]
