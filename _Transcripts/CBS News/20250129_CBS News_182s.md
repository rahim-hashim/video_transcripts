# Former Sen. Bob Menendez slams 11-year prison sentence, says "Trump is right"
**CBS News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY)
*  A judge has sentenced former New Jersey senator Bob Menendez to 11 years in prison. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=0.0s)]
*  Today's sentencing comes several months after a jury convicted Menendez on 16 felony counts, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  including bribery, extortion, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=11.08s)]
*  He was also found guilty of acting as a foreign agent for the government of Egypt. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=15.32s)]
*  The former lawmaker slammed the court while delivering remarks to reporters. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=20.02s)]
*  Welcome to the Southern District of New York, the wild west of political prosecutions. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=24.6s)]
*  President Trump is right. This process is political and it's corrupted to the core. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  Senator Menendez quoting President Trump. He will not report to jail until June 6 so [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=37.44s)]
*  he can attend his wife's bribery trial. That's scheduled to start in March. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  CBS News reporter Katrina Kaufman joins us now. Katrina, great to see you. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=47.6s)]
*  What's the reaction up in New York in the courtroom, excuse me, in the courtroom defending today's sentencing? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=51.4s)]
*  Bob, it's great to join you. During the sentencing, Menendez stood there just very silently looking at the judge. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=56.6s)]
*  His hands clasped and his children, Rob and Alicia, were right behind him. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  But what I think was even more striking is the contrast of the way Menendez acted in the courtroom today [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  versus that clip that you played outside of the courtroom, Bob, because Menendez spoke on his own behalf in court to the judge, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=76.48s)]
*  which is the right of a criminal defendant during a sentencing. And he really got quite emotional. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=84.08s)]
*  He broke down crying to the judge. He called himself a chastened man. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=90.52s)]
*  He said that the judge hadn't gotten to know who he truly was and told stories about his many years of service, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=96.08s)]
*  how he had helped save lives over the years. But when he came outside, he really had no contrition. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  He proclaimed his innocence. And as you were just saying, he was quoting President Trump, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=110.28s)]
*  really just talking about the injustice of the New York political system. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=116.64s)]
*  Katrina, prosecutors were calling for Senator Menendez to serve 15 years while the defense team was arguing he should serve just about two or less than that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  Why did the judge ultimately sent him sentence him to 11 years? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=131.04s)]
*  Bob, the judge said that he decided to sentence Menendez below what the guidelines said because of a few factors. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=135.64s)]
*  One is his age. He's 71 years old. Also his health and his decades of public service. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=142.56s)]
*  But the judge also felt that he really had to show deterrence here, a general deterrence. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  He didn't think that Menendez is going to commit this type of crime again, but he had to show the public that you just can't violate the public oath in this way. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  You can't have bribery and fraud and a betrayal of the voters in the government. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=166.24s)]
*  Katrina Kaufman, great reporter, always on top of all the legal happenings in New York. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  They seem to never end, Katrina. Thank you for being with us. Thank you, Bob. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODH1-gVmGY&t=178.52s)]
