# Israel blocks Gaza aid to pressure Hamas to extend ceasefire
**CBS News:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHhXza6A_Yk)
*  Turning to the Middle East now, a seven-year-old man has been killed and four others injured in a stabbing attack in Israel this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHhXza6A_Yk&t=0.0s)]
*  The attack took place at a bus station in the northern Israeli city of Haifa. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHhXza6A_Yk&t=7.0s)]
*  Police say the assailant has also been killed. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHhXza6A_Yk&t=11.0s)]
*  This comes as uncertainty surrounds the future of the Gaza ceasefire deal. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHhXza6A_Yk&t=14.0s)]
*  Over the weekend, Israel blocked aid from entering the enclave, demanding Hamas accept the terms of what it called a U.S. proposal to extend the fragile agreement. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHhXza6A_Yk&t=19.0s)]
*  With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning that if the Milton Group refused, there will be, quote, further consequences. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHhXza6A_Yk&t=29.0s)]
*  Our Deborah Pata has more on this from Jerusalem. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHhXza6A_Yk&t=36.0s)]
*  Ceasefire mediators Egypt and Qatar have accused Israel of violating humanitarian law by using starvation as a weapon after it stopped all aid entering Gaza. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHhXza6A_Yk&t=39.0s)]
*  The cuts come as Ramadan began over the weekend. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHhXza6A_Yk&t=52.0s)]
*  For many Palestinians in Gaza, like Fadwa Salour, a mother of three, there is not much to celebrate during the Muslim holy month. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHhXza6A_Yk&t=55.0s)]
*  Her husband was killed and her home destroyed in an Israeli airstrike. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHhXza6A_Yk&t=64.0s)]
*  Israel wants to delay negotiations for a permanent end to the war. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHhXza6A_Yk&t=69.0s)]
*  Instead, it supports a U.S. proposal to extend the current ceasefire and free half of the remaining hostages immediately. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHhXza6A_Yk&t=74.0s)]
*  Hamas says this is not what was originally agreed on. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHhXza6A_Yk&t=83.0s)]
*  Hostage families and their supporters have once again been plunged back into the uncertainty of not knowing if there is a deal to bring their loved ones home. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHhXza6A_Yk&t=87.0s)]
*  And in Gaza, the future also in limbo as Palestinians struggle to pick up the pieces of lives shattered by a wall that nobody wants to return to. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHhXza6A_Yk&t=98.0s)]
*  And following Israel's decision to suspend aid to Gaza, we are told food prices in local markets doubled almost immediately. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHhXza6A_Yk&t=109.0s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHhXza6A_Yk&t=120.0s)]
*  Deborah, thank you. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHhXza6A_Yk&t=122.0s)]
