# Luncheon toasts for President Trump
**CBS News:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc)
*  And we today are following here [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=0.0s)]
*  in our nation's capital, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=2.1s)]
*  the inauguration of Donald Trump [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=3.4s)]
*  as the 47th president of the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=4.9s)]
*  United States. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  And there's a snapshot here of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  two key places, because on [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=9.4s)]
*  Capitol Hill, it looks just like [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=10.9s)]
*  the sun is beginning to set here [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=12.4s)]
*  in Washington. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=14.0s)]
*  It is frigid here, and that's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=14.8s)]
*  why all of the activities were [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=16.1s)]
*  moved indoors. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=17.7s)]
*  And there is the luncheon in [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  Statuary Hall. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  The cameras are back on as they [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=21.5s)]
*  are wrapping up that delayed [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=23.6s)]
*  luncheon there at 3.38, where [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=25.3s)]
*  they... [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=27.3s)]
*  Oh, well, we're gonna hear the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=29.5s)]
*  toasts here. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=30.900000000000002s)]
*  The luncheon's still going on, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=31.900000000000002s)]
*  Norah. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=33.0s)]
*  Still going on. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=33.5s)]
*  And let's listen now to Senator [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=36.4s)]
*  Klobuchar. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=38.6s)]
*  ...Lois of Louisiana and leader [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=39.3s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffrey of New York for [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=41.5s)]
*  the presentation of the flags to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=44.0s)]
*  the president and the vice [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=46.2s)]
*  president. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=47.5s)]
*  And we are set to hear now from [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=56.0s)]
*  Steve Scalise in a toast to the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=58.4s)]
*  new president of the United [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=60.8s)]
*  States and the first lady. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=62.5s)]
*  A lot of the pleasantries going [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=64.3s)]
*  on here. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=65.7s)]
*  And as you can see, enjoying a [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=67.0s)]
*  luncheon there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=71.7s)]
*  And then they will head over to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=72.5s)]
*  Capitol One arena, where tens of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=74.2s)]
*  thousands of people are waiting. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=76.2s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=77.8s)]
*  ...Mr. Vice President, Madam [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=78.6s)]
*  Second Lady, what a wonderful [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=81.9s)]
*  occasion. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=83.8s)]
*  We all come here to celebrate [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=84.5s)]
*  what is a great tradition in the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  United States, and that is the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=88.5s)]
*  peaceful transfer of power. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  And when President Trump spoke [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=92.3s)]
*  over in the beautiful rotunda, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=95.5s)]
*  wonderful that it was indoors, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=98.0s)]
*  Mr. President, because I don't [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  think the crowd would have wanted [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=100.5s)]
*  to be in the 20s or below. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=102.5s)]
*  But one of the things President [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=104.5s)]
*  Trump said that I thought was the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=106.89999999999999s)]
*  most touching, he said, in [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=108.6s)]
*  America, the impossible is what [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  we do best. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=113.69999999999999s)]
*  And I think that epitomizes this [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=115.5s)]
*  spirit when you think about this [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=117.0s)]
*  room, this statuary hall, and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=118.2s)]
*  you look at some of the statues. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=121.4s)]
*  Thomas Edison, he did the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=122.7s)]
*  impossible. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=124.5s)]
*  Elon Musk, I'm not sure if Elon [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=126.3s)]
*  is still here. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=127.9s)]
*  Elon does some of those things [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=128.4s)]
*  himself. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=129.8s)]
*  But you look at somebody like [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=131.2s)]
*  Rosa Parks, and she did [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=132.5s)]
*  something that many would have [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=136.4s)]
*  said couldn't be done with just [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=138.5s)]
*  a simple gesture of saying, I'm [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=141.3s)]
*  not going to sit in the back of [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=143.0s)]
*  the bus. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=144.3s)]
*  And so the impossible is what we [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=145.9s)]
*  do in America. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=147.9s)]
*  And President Trump said [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=150.3s)]
*  something else. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=151.8s)]
*  He said, our golden age has just [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=153.4s)]
*  begun. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=156.70000000000002s)]
*  America's ready for another [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=157.8s)]
*  golden age. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=159.10000000000002s)]
*  Mr. President, we present to you [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=160.10000000000002s)]
*  these flags that were flown over [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=163.4s)]
*  the United States Capitol at [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=164.8s)]
*  full mast in honor of being [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=166.3s)]
*  sworn in as President of the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=169.9s)]
*  United States. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=171.5s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=175.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=178.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=179.8s)]
*  Thank you, Chairwoman Klobuchar [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=182.10000000000002s)]
*  for your leadership of today's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  ceremonies. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=185.10000000000002s)]
*  President Trump, Madam [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=186.5s)]
*  First Lady, congratulations. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=187.70000000000002s)]
*  I have the honor of presenting [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=190.5s)]
*  the Vice President with our [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  nation's highest symbol, the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=192.8s)]
*  American flag. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=195.3s)]
*  As a United States Marine, Vice [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=197.10000000000002s)]
*  President put on the uniform to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=200.10000000000002s)]
*  protect and serve America. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=201.70000000000002s)]
*  Like so many men and women before [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=205.4s)]
*  him in our nation's history, Old [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=207.9s)]
*  Glory was adopted in wartime by [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=210.6s)]
*  the Second Continental Congress [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=213.1s)]
*  in 1777, a full 12 years before [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=216.4s)]
*  the office of the Vice [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=220.5s)]
*  Presidency was even created or [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=221.5s)]
*  the House of Representatives [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=225.5s)]
*  convened for the first time. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=226.9s)]
*  The resolution said that the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=230.3s)]
*  flag would be 13 stars, white, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=231.3s)]
*  and a blue field representing a [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=235.3s)]
*  new constellation out of many [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=238.60000000000002s)]
*  one. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=243.4s)]
*  Some 250 years later, from [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=245.8s)]

*  On behalf of the Congress, we [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=273.7s)]

*  Mr. J.D. Vance. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=465.4s)]
*  J.D., you wrote something very [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=466.4s)]
*  poignant in your memoir. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=467.4s)]
*  Actually, many things very [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=468.4s)]
*  poignant, but let me quote you [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=469.4s)]
*  here. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=470.4s)]
*  What separates the successful [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=471.4s)]
*  from the unsuccessful are the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=472.4s)]
*  expectations they had for their [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=475.4s)]
*  own lives. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=477.4s)]
*  That's really meaningful. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=478.4s)]
*  That expectation is a powerful [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=479.4s)]
*  thing. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=481.4s)]
*  We remember the people in our [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=482.4s)]
*  lives who provided that to us. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=483.4s)]
*  We all need that. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=485.4s)]
*  Everybody needs hope and [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=486.4s)]
*  encouragement. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=487.4s)]
*  They need a greater [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=488.4s)]
*  expectation. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=489.4s)]
*  We need people in our lives who [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=490.4s)]
*  will make us look farther and [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=491.4s)]
*  reach higher. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=494.4s)]
*  J.D.'s written a lot about the [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=495.4s)]
*  people in his life that have [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=496.4s)]
*  done that. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=497.4s)]
*  He's written about, we know the [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=498.4s)]

*  and what they did in your life. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=501.4s)]
*  He's written about his [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=502.4s)]
*  professors and mentors they met [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=503.4s)]
*  in law school. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=505.4s)]
*  He writes a lot about, speaks a [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=506.4s)]
*  lot about his gracious, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=508.4s)]
*  beautiful wife, our new second [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=509.4s)]
*  lady, Usha. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=511.4s)]
*  He's a great inspiration as well. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=512.4s)]
*  J.D., you yourself have been [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=514.4s)]
*  inspiring people. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=517.4s)]
*  Your story really has. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=518.4s)]
*  It's one of the reasons that I [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=519.4s)]
*  believe God has raised your [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=520.4s)]
*  platform as he has because you've [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=521.4s)]
*  been so faithful to tell that [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=523.4s)]
*  story and to inspire so many [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=524.4s)]
*  others. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=526.4s)]
*  Our hope and our prayer is as you [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=527.4s)]
*  continue to do this, that as you [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=529.4s)]
*  go to help us execute on the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=531.4s)]
*  America First agenda, that you [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=533.4s)]
*  also do what you've been doing so [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=535.4s)]
*  well all along, and that is [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=537.4s)]
*  providing a model for us to [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=538.4s)]
*  follow. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=540.4s)]
*  We're going to be a model for [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=541.4s)]
*  what is possible in America. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=542.4s)]

*  had. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=545.4s)]
*  And it's just getting started. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=546.4s)]
*  I pray specifically that you [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=547.4s)]
*  inspire a lot of the young men [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=548.4s)]
*  in America. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=549.4s)]
*  Some of them feel hopeless and [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=550.4s)]
*  stagnant sometimes. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=552.4s)]
*  And you're a great example to [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=553.4s)]
*  all of them and to all of us. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=554.4s)]
*  That if you work hard and you [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=556.4s)]
*  play by the rules and you do the [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=558.4s)]
*  right thing, you can make a [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=560.4s)]

*  politics was Ronald Reagan. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=639.4s)]
*  His philosophy of limited [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=641.4s)]
*  government, his belief in peace [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=643.4s)]
*  through strength, the strength [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=645.4s)]
*  of his convictions, were all [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=647.4s)]
*  things that appealed to me, but [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=649.4s)]
*  I was also drawn by his optimism [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=651.4s)]
*  and by his belief in America. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=653.4s)]
*  And, Mr. President, those are [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=655.4s)]
*  qualities that I see in you. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=657.4s)]
*  One of the things that resonated [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=659.4s)]
*  throughout your campaign was the [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=661.4s)]
*  unshakable belief in our country [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=663.4s)]
*  and in her citizens. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=665.4s)]
*  You remind us of everything [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=667.4s)]
*  that's possible in America. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=669.4s)]
*  I'm looking forward to working [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=671.4s)]
*  with you over the next four [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=673.4s)]
*  years to build up our great [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=675.4s)]
*  country. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=677.4s)]
*  It says in the scriptures that if [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=679.4s)]
*  you ask for wisdom, it will be [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=681.4s)]
*  given to you generously. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=683.4s)]
*  And so I pray and our prayer is [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=685.4s)]
*  that God will richly bless you [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=687.4s)]
*  in the years ahead and grant you [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=689.4s)]
*  not only strength, but wisdom. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJUazsQHuxc&t=691.4s)]
