Video Description: The White House says President Biden will not enforce the U.S. ban on TikTok set to go into effect over the weekend if the app isn't divested from by Chinese parent company ByteDance.

# White House official says Biden won't enforce TikTok ban
**CBS News:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c)
*  TikTok faces a weekend deadline ordered by Congress to sell the company or shut down the app. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=0.0s)]
*  But now the White House says President Biden will not enforce the ban if it does take effect. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=6.08s)]
*  That leaves the company's future up to the Supreme Court and President-elect Donald Trump. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Jan Crawford is tracking the backlash to this ban. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=15.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the clock is really ticking for TikTok and we see Washington scrambling to see [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=19.68s)]
*  if they can buy some more time. Democratic senators really pushing the White House to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=25.12s)]
*  try to use this extension built into the law, a 90-day extension, that would give TikTok more [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=29.28s)]
*  time to try to find a deal, perhaps a political solution. But that's pretty limited, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=34.88s)]
*  that extension. So it's not clear that's even possible. We saw Senate Majority Leader Chuck [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=38.8s)]
*  Schumer, he spoke with President Biden and is now saying that he will work with the Trump [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=44.0s)]
*  administration to try to find some kind of solution. Now this is all because of a federal [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=48.72s)]
*  law that Congress passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. President Biden signed [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=53.84s)]
*  into the law that would ban TikTok unless it finds that non-Chinese buyer and that's the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=58.64s)]
*  world we're in. TikTok sued, took it straight to the Supreme Court. The justices heard arguments [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=64.08s)]
*  a week ago on whether or not this law violates the First Amendment. That's the decision that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=69.84s)]
*  we're waiting on. I expect that we will hear this morning on whether or not that law can be struck [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=74.0s)]
*  down. I think it's unlikely the justices really were skeptical of those arguments. It's possible [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=79.36s)]
*  they could have some kind of brief pause in this to again allow perhaps some deal making to be done. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=85.28s)]
*  There have been potential buyers come forward even though the Chinese government is signaling [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=91.68s)]
*  it is not going to sell TikTok. So right now we'll have to wait and see what the court rules but [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=96.88s)]
*  at the moment it looks like time is running out. All right, back to you. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=103.36s)]
*  Jan, thank you for that. Now as the future of TikTok remains uncertain, many small business [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=107.36s)]
*  owners are sharing concerns about what this ban may mean for them. Food review TikToker Marco [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=112.48s)]
*  Molina, maybe you've seen him, says a viral video on the app can be a game changer for local shops [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=118.96s)]
*  and content creators. It really is unfortunate. It's going to have a huge impact on both creators [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=124.64s)]
*  and then in my instances where I go and I promote businesses, the small businesses that I like to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  promote. I mean I'm losing a whole platform. According to TikTok, more than seven million [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=136.24s)]
*  small businesses use their app for marketing and sales and get this generated more than 14 billion [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=143.36s)]
*  dollars in sales back in 2023. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfsXFNgz14c&t=149.68s)]
