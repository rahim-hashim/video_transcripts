# What we know about the Army helicopter involved in deadly midair D.C. plane crash
**CBS News:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8)
*  CBS News senior national security correspondent Charlie Dagata joins us now to help understand [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=0.0s)]
*  how this unfolded. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=7.24s)]
*  Charlie, you're at the Pentagon. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=8.48s)]
*  What are we learning? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=10.48s)]
*  Yeah, well, Errol, you know, you hit the nail on the head when you said every time you come [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=11.48s)]
*  into D.C., you see what kind of activity there is. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=15.94s)]
*  You know, it's routine to see military choppers going up and down the Potomac right around [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=19.84s)]
*  Reagan National Airport. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=24.8s)]
*  So as soon as that happened, we were checking with military sources. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=26.24s)]
*  As soon as we heard it was a helicopter, we just naturally assumed that the military would [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=29.52s)]
*  have been involved. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=33.68s)]
*  Military officials tell us that theâ€”it was an Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  We've reported that before out of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, taking part in a training flight. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=40.839999999999996s)]
*  The Fort Belvoir is about 17 miles south of Reagan. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=47.84s)]
*  The Black Hawk belonged to B Company, 12th Aviation Battalion. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=53.7s)]
*  Officials confirmed, as we've reported already, three soldiers on board. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=57.900000000000006s)]
*  None of them were senior officials. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=61.300000000000004s)]
*  The new defense secretary, Pete Hegsett, said on exit, an investigation was launched immediately. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=63.86s)]
*  The Army and the Defense Department are cooperating. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=69.98s)]
*  This is being led by the NTSB. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=72.98s)]
*  He also called the incident absolutely tragic. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=75.82000000000001s)]
*  You know, as you know, these helicopters are often used to transport military personnel, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=79.5s)]
*  some cases VIP and other duties around the Washington area. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=84.66s)]
*  And I say that because, as part of their training, they would learn how to travel and how to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=88.82s)]
*  fly and get around in congested airspace and learn the flight patterns near the airport. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=94.58s)]
*  So a law enforcement source close to the investigation has told us that investigators will examine [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=100.26s)]
*  pilot experience in that DC airspace. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=105.86s)]
*  And those are the questions that we're asking here. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=108.9s)]
*  We're being told, look, let's wait. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=110.82s)]
*  Let's wait for the NTSB. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=112.46s)]
*  They are driving the investigation and the DOD and the Army are doing everything they [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=113.9s)]
*  can to cooperate. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=118.18s)]
*  And as we wait for an official report and official remarks from government sources, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=119.78s)]
*  I'm wondering what you make of the details that we do know. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=124.78s)]
*  One thing our senior transportation correspondent, Chris Van Cleave, mentioned moments ago was [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=129.5s)]
*  that on his recent military chopper flights ahead of the inauguration, he witnessed as [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=133.62s)]
*  they had to lower in altitude to, I think, less than 200 feet when getting near DCA. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=139.70000000000002s)]
*  And we heard at the press conference that while this was a training mission, as it's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=148.10000000000002s)]
*  been described, soldiers on board are experienced, they are skilled. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=151.9s)]
*  So what do you make of that? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=156.54000000000002s)]
*  And can you help us understand in layman's terms what it means that they were on a training [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=158.22000000000003s)]
*  mission? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=162.38000000000002s)]
*  Is that not? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=164.18s)]
*  Well, you know, Errol, in layman's terms, almost everything is a training mission. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=165.18s)]
*  I think the reason they're saying it was a training mission is because it wasn't [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=169.62s)]
*  necessarily transporting personnel from one place to another. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=173.5s)]
*  They weren't on an operational mission. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=177.22s)]
*  So it's a training mission. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=179.66s)]
*  Again, not unique, if anything, its routine to see Black Hawk helicopters up and down [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=181.18s)]
*  the Potomac. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=186.74s)]
*  You know, I just moved here about six months ago and I'm just blown away by the amount [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=187.74s)]
*  of traffic around Reagan National Airport and how low the planes come in right over [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=191.86s)]
*  the Pentagon as they land. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=197.14000000000001s)]
*  So that is a congested airspace. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=199.26000000000002s)]
*  But of course, in manner speaking, they do have their lanes. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=201.9s)]
*  I think what will have to be determined, and this is way out of my pay grade, is whether [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=206.86s)]
*  they were operating within that envelope. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=211.82000000000002s)]
*  We know that it's tight. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=214.22000000000003s)]
*  Chris Van Cleave knows that it's tight. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=215.58s)]
*  You can see it for yourself. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=217.66000000000003s)]
*  We have to determine what went wrong, or they have to determine what went wrong. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=219.94s)]
*  And I've been listening to one of the press conferences this morning and they said, look, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=223.58s)]
*  the flight path of the helicopter was routine. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=227.9s)]
*  The flight paths were not unusual in the D.C. area, either for the incoming aircraft or for [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=230.70000000000002s)]
*  the chopper. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=237.34s)]
*  But clearly something went wrong and that's what they'll have to determine here. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  In terms of experience, they would, well, the Army would argue that the pilots and that [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=242.62s)]
*  crew would not have been flying in that area if they lacked the experience. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=247.73999999999998s)]
*  So I guess what I'm trying to say here is let's not necessarily confuse a training mission [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=252.14s)]
*  with sort of newcomers or individuals that weren't capable of flying within that airspace. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=258.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly what I wanted you to drill down on. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=263.9s)]
*  We are getting some early information that the NTSB, which we've discussed is leading [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=268.09999999999997s)]
*  this investigation, may deliver their first press conference to the public at about 2 [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=274.82s)]
*  p.m. this afternoon. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=280.18s)]
*  This incident happening approximately 12 hours ago from this moment. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=282.65999999999997s)]
*  Charlie, what is the physical posturing around the airport? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=287.62s)]
*  We know it's closed to incoming outgoing traffic until at least 11 a.m. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=293.3s)]
*  That may get pushed back. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=297.34s)]
*  What more can you tell us? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=298.98s)]
*  OK, well, so as soon as this happened last night, in addition to contacting our sources [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=300.38s)]
*  here at the Pentagon, I'm only about 15 minutes away from the airport. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=305.7s)]
*  So I made a beeline for the airport to the Potomac. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=309.21999999999997s)]
*  Obviously, all the roads leading to the airport were closed off. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=312.5s)]
*  And you may have seen some of our coverage at Tony DeCople on the other side of the Potomac. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=315.34s)]
*  That was as close as we could get. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=320.34s)]
*  It was a clear night, very cold. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=321.62s)]
*  In fact, the Potomac had been frozen over for a number of weeks leading up to this and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=323.58s)]
*  there was still ice there. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=328.21999999999997s)]
*  It gives you an idea of how cold it is and was. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=329.3s)]
*  Then, while we were there, it seemed that the helicopters, specifically the helicopters, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=332.98s)]
*  were broadening their search area. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=338.74s)]
*  And I think that's what Tony was referring to earlier, the reason that they were moved [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=341.26000000000005s)]
*  off that area, because, you know, it's probably a mile or two across. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=344.82000000000005s)]
*  And what I saw, and you could see this in the darkness of night, there seemed to be [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=350.66s)]
*  three very distinct debris fields. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=354.98s)]
*  One in particular, to the right from where I was looking, which is furthest away from [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=358.7s)]
*  the airport, where there's a lot of emergency vehicles there. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=361.58s)]
*  Again, divers, there's a lot of illumination to help with the search. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=365.62s)]
*  At one point, by the way, last night, they asked us to turn off our lights because it [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=371.06s)]
*  was getting in the way of their night vision and their searches. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=375.17999999999995s)]
*  So if anything, that area of debris that they had been searching has been widened across [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=379.41999999999996s)]
*  the river and including the marina, which is where most of the television crews had set up. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=385.74s)]
*  And we did hear during the press conference a short time ago that the fuselage is in three [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=390.62s)]
*  distinct sections there. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=394.62s)]
*  It has now moved on to a recovery mission. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=397.02000000000004s)]
*  Charlie Daggett, giving us the latest from the Pentagon. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=399.62s)]
*  Charlie, we will surely continue to connect with you throughout the day. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=402.14000000000004s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-cX3pL2_E8&t=406.18s)]
