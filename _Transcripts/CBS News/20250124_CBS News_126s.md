*  voted to break the tie. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=17.88s)]

*  secretary. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=26.66s)]
*  As the vice president did, as people expected, he cast the tie-breaking vote to say yes. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=27.66s)]
*  He is now the defense secretary. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=34.86s)]
*  The big surprise of the night was Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who did vote no. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  The other Republican senators who voted no were Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  of Alaska. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  They publicly made their intentions known going into this vote. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  Another surprise was Tom Tillis of North Carolina. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=50.06s)]
*  He was undecided, but he spoke for several hours with Hexth today, and he voted yes. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=52.46s)]
*  We don't know what was discussed, but he did vote yes. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=59.96s)]
*  But once again, that's J.D. Vance, who cast the tie-breaking vote in the nomination for [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=62.34s)]
*  Pete Hexth as defense secretary. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=68.82s)]
*  Now, earlier, just a few minutes ago, we actually heard from President Trump, who is in California, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=70.84s)]
*  and he was speaking to reporters there tonight at a press conference, a brief press conference, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=78.52s)]
*  and he said he spoke to Pete Hexth on the phone on his plane, and he said that he thinks [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  that Pete Hexth will be a great secretary of defense. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=90.1s)]
*  He said he did not know that Mitch McConnell voted no until the reporters said it during [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=93.08s)]
*  the press conference, but he also said it didn't actually matter because winning is [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=97.69999999999999s)]
*  what matters. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=103.89999999999999s)]
*  So that is the latest on the Senate floor. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=104.89999999999999s)]
*  A dramatic evening tonight. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=107.88s)]
*  50-50 was the vote for senators voting in the nomination for Pete Hexth, but Vice President [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=110.08s)]
*  J.D. Vance had to come in and cast the tie-breaking vote. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=117.28s)]
*  They had to wait for about almost an hour for him to come and break that tie. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bVznQs1C10&t=120.08s)]
