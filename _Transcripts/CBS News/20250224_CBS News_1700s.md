# Trump, Macron take questions on Ukraine-Russia war
**CBS News:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE)
*  Just moments ago, President Trump took questions in the Oval Office alongside French President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=0.0s)]
*  Emmanuel Macron. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=4.68s)]
*  The two leaders discussed a range of topics, including the war in Ukraine and the future [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=5.88s)]
*  of federal employees. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=10.76s)]
*  Take a listen to that. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=12.38s)]
*  Man, in my book, we were together. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=13.38s)]
*  We did it together. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=16.38s)]
*  And I think a lot of progress has been made. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=18.38s)]
*  We've had some very good talks with Russia. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=21.94s)]
*  We've had some very good talks with others. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=24.52s)]
*  We're trying to get the war ended with Russia and Ukraine. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=26.9s)]
*  And I think we've come a long way in a short period of weeks. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=30.34s)]
*  And the President has been very helpful also. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=34.46s)]
*  And we're also talking about trade, various trade deals that we will be doing with France. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=37.739999999999995s)]
*  And we'll be discussing a little bit further. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=43.34s)]
*  Then we'll have a press conference later on. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=46.62s)]
*  You can ask some questions. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=48.459999999999994s)]
*  We'll be having a press conference in a little while. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=50.14s)]
*  We're going to have lunch with the entire French staff. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=51.86s)]
*  And we look forward to it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=56.22s)]
*  And again, the relationship has been very special with France and very special with [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=57.54s)]
*  this gentleman on my right. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=61.78s)]
*  And we look forward to keeping that going for a long period of time. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=64.26s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=67.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=68.06s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=69.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=70.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=71.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=72.06s)]
*  I want to thank Mr. President for his hospitality. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=73.06s)]
*  We had a good discussion this morning for the G7 here and for the third year of this [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=76.06s)]
*  war in Ukraine. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=83.42s)]
*  And I think our common objective clearly is to build peace and a solid and longstanding [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=85.58s)]
*  peace. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=92.5s)]
*  And this is what we will discuss obviously because I have great respect for bravery and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=93.5s)]
*  the resistance of Ukrainian people. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=100.58s)]
*  And we do share the objective of peace, but we are very aware of the necessity to have [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=103.86s)]
*  guarantees and solid peace in order to stabilize the situation. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=109.78s)]
*  I'm here as a friend because through centuries we've been friends, and we are personal friends, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=114.42s)]
*  as you mentioned it, because we work very well together. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=121.06s)]
*  And I think the U.S. and France always stand on the same side, the right side, I would [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=124.34s)]
*  say, of history. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=129.01999999999998s)]
*  And this is exactly what's at stake today. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=130.57999999999998s)]
*  And this is a very important moment for Europe as well. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=132.82s)]
*  And I'm here as well after discussions with all my colleagues to say that Europe is willing [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=135.26s)]
*  to step up, to be a stronger partner, to do more in defense and security for its continent, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=141.82s)]
*  and as well to be a reliable partner and to be engaged in great economy, investment, in [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=149.22s)]
*  a lot of topics. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=156.26s)]
*  So I'm very excited by the discussion we will have, and obviously we will follow up. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=157.26s)]
*  And I want to thank you again, Mr. President, for your presence, for Notre Dame de Paris. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=162.66s)]
*  It meant a lot for French people. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=166.66s)]
*  And I want to thank you for that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=169.06s)]
*  That's the cathedral, and they've done a fantastic job. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=172.06s)]
*  The President's done a great job in bringing it back. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=175.1s)]
*  That was a terrible thing, like, what, five years ago? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=177.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=180.14000000000001s)]
*  Watching that burn was a very horrible site, and you've done a fantastic job in bringing [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=181.14000000000001s)]
*  it back. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=186.46s)]
*  So I congratulate you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=187.46s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=188.46s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=189.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=190.46s)]
*  Anybody want to ask a question or two? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=191.46s)]
*  I think we've reached the agreement between the Ukrainians on the critical minerals deal. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=194.74s)]
*  It looks like we're getting very close. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=199.74s)]
*  The deal is being worked on. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=202.38s)]
*  We're, I think, getting very close to getting an agreement where we get our money back over [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=203.74s)]
*  a period of time. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=210.5s)]
*  But it also gives us something where I think it's very beneficial to their economy, to [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=211.5s)]
*  them as a country. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=216.46s)]
*  But, you know, we're in for $350 billion. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=217.46s)]
*  How we got there, I don't know. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=221.38s)]
*  That's a lot of money. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=223.82s)]
*  A lot of money invested. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=224.82s)]
*  And we had nothing to show for it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=227.2s)]
*  It was the Biden administration's fault. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=230.32s)]
*  The Europeans are in for about $100 billion, and they do it in the form of a loan. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=235.11999999999998s)]
*  And the Europeans have been great on this issue. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=241.64s)]
*  They understood it wasn't fair, and we were able to work something out. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  But with the Ukrainians, I think I can say that we're very close. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=246.39999999999998s)]
*  Scott's around here someplace, and I think we can say that we're very close. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=251.04s)]
*  I think we're very close. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=255.44s)]
*  Do you have something to say about that, Scott? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=257.44s)]
*  We are very close. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=259.48s)]
*  Good. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=260.48s)]
*  One yard line. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=261.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=262.48s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=263.48s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=264.48s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=265.48s)]
*  What? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=266.48s)]
*  Would a middle deal include a security guarantee for Ukraine? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=267.48s)]
*  Well, it'll be Europe is going to make sure that nothing happens. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=271.48s)]
*  I don't think it's going to be much of a problem. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=275.2s)]
*  I think once we settle, there's going to be no more war in Ukraine, and you're not going [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=277.0s)]
*  to have a — it's not going to be a very big problem. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=282.16s)]
*  That's going to be the least of it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=285.04s)]
*  Mr. President, we're hearing from some Greek media reporting that the U.S. has agreed [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=286.04s)]
*  to shut down a military base in Greece that's been a logistical hub for NATO. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=291.44s)]
*  That it shut — that who shut down? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=295.36s)]
*  That the U.S. has agreed to shut it down at the request of Turkey and Russia. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=297.12s)]
*  Is that at all true? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=301.04s)]
*  Marco, do you have anything to say about that? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=302.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=303.04s)]
*  Who else is in? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=304.04s)]
*  No. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=305.04s)]
*  That's enough. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=306.16s)]
*  So — [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=307.16s)]
*  Mr. President — [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=308.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=309.16s)]
*  Mr. President — [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=310.16s)]
*  Is it a no? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=311.16s)]
*  It's a no, sir. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=312.16s)]
*  It's not a correct step. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=313.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=314.16s)]
*  Mr. President, how do you react to people in Europe who say that you are abandoning Ukraine [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=315.16s)]
*  and that you are going to sacrifice the security of Ukraine by making a deal with Elmir Putin? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=319.56s)]
*  No, we're helping Ukraine like nobody's ever helped Ukraine before. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=325.16s)]
*  And I can say this, if I didn't become President, Ukraine would right now still be at a level [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=330.64000000000004s)]
*  where there would be no — we've been thinking about a peace. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=336.08s)]
*  And it was — it's a sad thing that this happened. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=339.36s)]
*  This would have never happened, this war, if I were President. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=343.16s)]
*  Zero chance. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=345.68s)]
*  And it has happened. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=347.64s)]
*  So my function is to get you out of the war. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=349.36s)]
*  Get them out of the war. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=353.64s)]
*  Let them live. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=354.8s)]
*  It's a bloody war. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=355.8s)]
*  It's a horrible war. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=356.8s)]
*  Thousands of people are being killed a week. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=358.04s)]
*  And I would say Russia, maybe 700,000 people. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=360.78s)]
*  I think Ukraine, probably a similar number. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=365.08000000000004s)]
*  And that's not talking about the towns and the cities that have been blown up. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  That's talking about soldiers. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=370.48s)]
*  This has been a horrible, bloody mess. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=372.48s)]
*  And we're going to get it solved. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=377.08000000000004s)]
*  We got to get it solved. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=378.6s)]
*  And you know, we're not talking about American soldiers — soldiers from this country. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=380.24s)]
*  We're talking about Russia and Ukraine. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=385.32000000000005s)]
*  On a humanitarian basis, we have to get this very, very bloody, savage problem solved. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=388.2s)]
*  And I will say this also. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=395.36s)]
*  It could lead to World War Three if it's not solved. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=396.92s)]
*  You know, there'll be a point at which it's not going to stop at those two countries already. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=399.16s)]
*  There's such involvement from other countries. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=404.24s)]
*  And it could really lead to a very big war — World War Three. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=406.44s)]
*  And we're not going to let that happen either. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=410.88s)]
*  Would you support the idea to send European troops in Ukraine to back the ceasefire? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=412.28000000000003s)]
*  European troops may go into Ukraine as peacemakers. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=416.8s)]
*  So when the agreement is done, they can watch that everything is followed properly. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=421.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't think that's going to be a problem. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=425.12s)]
*  And a lot of the European countries — I think — I don't want to speak for France, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=426.72s)]
*  but I know that the President has talked about doing that also. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=431.08000000000004s)]
*  I think that'll be a very good day when we can go in as peacekeepers as opposed to what's [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=435.32000000000005s)]
*  going on right now with everybody being killed. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=439.72s)]
*  Well, they have U.S. backings. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=442.4s)]
*  Those troops going into Ukraine. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=443.96s)]
*  But they have U.S. backings from U.S. troops. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=445.36s)]
*  Well, we're going to have a backing of some kind. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=448.04s)]
*  And obviously, the European countries are going to be involved. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=449.88s)]
*  And I don't think you're going to need much backing. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=454.4s)]
*  I think that's not going to be a problem. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=457.24s)]
*  Once an agreement is signed, Russia is going to get back to its business, and Ukraine and [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=459.2s)]
*  Europe are going to get back to their business. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=464.76s)]
*  I don't think it's going to be a problem. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=466.48s)]
*  Mr. President, could you please — [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=468.03999999999996s)]
*  Can you talk about Doge? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=469.32s)]
*  — President Zelensky's — [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=470.24s)]
*  What? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=471.44s)]
*  — meeting with President Zelensky soon? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=471.96s)]
*  I will be meeting with President Zelensky. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=474.88s)]
*  In fact, he may come in this week or next week to sign the agreement. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=477.08s)]
*  And which would be nice. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=481.79999999999995s)]
*  I'd love to meet him — would meet at the Oval Office. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=482.79999999999995s)]
*  So the agreement is being worked on now. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=486.44s)]
*  They're very close to a final deal. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=488.44s)]
*  It'll be a deal with rare earths and various other things. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=491.08s)]
*  And he would like to come, as I understand it, here to sign it. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=494.88s)]
*  And that would be great with me. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=499.03999999999996s)]
*  I think they then have to get it approved by their council or whoever might approve it. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=500.6s)]
*  But I'm sure that will happen. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=504.68s)]
*  Mr. President, could you please meet with President Putin also? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=506.68s)]
*  I'll be meeting with President Putin also, yes. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=510.08s)]
*  Mr. President, could you please meet with President Putin also? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=513.6s)]
*  I don't know when we speak. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=515.24s)]
*  We're trying to get this thing worked out. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=517.92s)]
*  But yeah, at some point, I'll be meeting with President Putin too. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=520.08s)]
*  Mr. President, could you please meet with President Putin also? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=523.76s)]
*  I can see if you're with the French. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=527.36s)]
*  No, I just... [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=529.36s)]
*  The President said it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=530.84s)]
*  I think it's an important moment. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=531.84s)]
*  It's an important moment in the discussion. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=535.84s)]
*  We want to build peace in Ukraine. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=537.6s)]
*  And the report that was recalled is a reality. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=539.76s)]
*  There are one million deaths and injuries since the beginning of this conflict and this war on aggression. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=542.32s)]
*  Our will is that this peace lasts, because we have already had a ceasefire [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=548.76s)]
*  and a peace that has not been respected. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=552.76s)]
*  It was the Minsk agreements, one and then two. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=554.04s)]
*  And so the core of this discussion is to ensure first that there is a ceasefire, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=556.36s)]
*  then that the Ukrainians are involved. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=561.36s)]
*  I think what the President of the United States just said is very important. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=563.36s)]
*  That is to say that we will meet President Zelensky quickly to sign this agreement [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=568.2s)]
*  on the critical mines and the rare lands. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=572.8000000000001s)]
*  And that it is also a way to have a strong American involvement. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=575.4s)]
*  Europeans are ready to take their charge under various forms of support for the Ukrainian army, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=579.04s)]
*  including to ensure that peace is lasting. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=584.2s)]
*  And the involvement in the duration of the United States through this agreement is a good thing. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=588.0400000000001s)]
*  And so everything is still to be built. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=593.2s)]
*  And I don't want to present discussions. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=595.08s)]
*  But we share the same goal, which we discussed this morning [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=597.08s)]
*  for an hour after the conference together. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=600.48s)]
*  And we will continue to work. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=602.44s)]
*  And they are, for me, good advances. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  And the announcement of... [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=605.48s)]
*  Is the territorial integrity of the United States still a positive goal? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=606.48s)]
*  We want to build peace with Ukraine. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=614.24s)]
*  As President Trump mentioned, there are already one million dead and wounded in Ukraine since the war began. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=616.0400000000001s)]
*  We had a ceasefire in the past that was not respected. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=621.6400000000001s)]
*  This was under the Minsk agreements 1 and 2. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=624.24s)]
*  President Trump, as he said, will be meeting with President Zelensky to sign a deal on rare earths. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=628.24s)]
*  And we are pleased to see this very strong American involvement. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=635.84s)]
*  Europe, of course, also stands ready to support Ukraine in various ways, supporting its military. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=639.88s)]
*  And we don't want to preempt any sort of discussions that are currently underway. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=646.08s)]
*  But we do share the same objective of building this lasting peace. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=650.64s)]
*  I just want to tell you a little story. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=656.08s)]
*  So we were at the Eiffel Tower having dinner with your wonderful wife and with my wonderful wife. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=657.52s)]
*  And we came out and he started speaking the French deal. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=663.0400000000001s)]
*  And we didn't have an interpreter. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=667.52s)]
*  And he was going on and on and on. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=668.88s)]
*  And I was just nodding. Yes, yes, yes. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=671.08s)]
*  And he really sold me out because I got back the next day and I read the papers. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=673.72s)]
*  I said, that's not what we said. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=677.24s)]
*  He's a smart customer. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=681.24s)]
*  I will tell you that. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=682.64s)]
*  I'll hold. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=684.84s)]
*  Mr. President, you called Zelensky a dictator. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=688.0400000000001s)]
*  Would you use the same words regarding Putin? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=689.84s)]
*  I don't use those words lightly. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=694.44s)]
*  I think that we're going to see how it all works out. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=696.0400000000001s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=698.28s)]
*  I think we have a chance of a really good settlement between various countries. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=699.88s)]
*  And, you know, you're talking about Europe and you're talking about Ukraine as part of that whole situation. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=704.48s)]
*  The other side has a lot of a lot of support also. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=712.28s)]
*  So let's see how it all works out. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=715.76s)]
*  It might work out. Look, you can never make up lives. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=717.48s)]
*  The one thing you can you can make up the money, but you can't make up the lives. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=720.36s)]
*  A lot of lives lost, I think probably a lot more lives than people are talking about. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=724.0799999999999s)]
*  It's been a it's been a rough war, but I think we're close to getting it solved. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=727.76s)]
*  Go ahead. Do you think that Doge could benefit from more streamlined communications? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=731.84s)]
*  There was that email telling employees to give five things that they've done last week. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=736.84s)]
*  Agency heads then told people to ignore it. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=741.84s)]
*  But you know, I must the last email that was sent where he wanted to know what you did this week. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=744.04s)]
*  You know why he wanted that, by the way, I thought it was great because we have people that don't show up to work. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=749.4399999999999s)]
*  And nobody even knows if they work for the government. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=755.5999999999999s)]
*  So by asking the question, tell us what you did this week. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=757.68s)]
*  What he's doing is saying, are you actually working? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=761.1199999999999s)]
*  And then if you don't answer, like you're sort of semi fired or you're fired because a lot of people are not answering because they don't even exist. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=764.16s)]
*  They're trying to. That's how badly various parts of our government were run by it, especially by this last group. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=773.9599999999999s)]
*  So what they're doing is they're trying to find out who's working for the government. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=780.4799999999999s)]
*  Are we paying other people that aren't working? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=784.64s)]
*  And you know, where is all this? Where's the money gone? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=787.6s)]
*  We have found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud so far, and we've just started. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=790.36s)]
*  We're actually going to Fort Knox to see if the gold is there because maybe somebody stole the gold, tons of gold. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=797.36s)]
*  Some of the agency. So I think it was actually there was a lot of genius in sending it. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=803.76s)]
*  We're trying to find out if people are working. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=809.24s)]
*  And so we're sending a letter to people. Please tell us what you did last week. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=811.44s)]
*  If people don't respond, it's very possible that there is no such person or they're not working. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=815.2800000000001s)]
*  Some of the agency heads instructed their employees not to respond because they're waiting on further guidance. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=820.6s)]
*  But Elon Musk's tweet said a failure to respond would be taken as a resignation. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=825.84s)]
*  So there's been a disconnect in communications. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=829.36s)]
*  Are you concerned at all about that? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=831.8000000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. That was done in a friendly manner. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=833.1600000000001s)]
*  Only things such as perhaps Marco at State Department where they have very confidential things or the FBI where they're working on confidential things. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=835.36s)]
*  And they don't mean that in any way combative really with Elon. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=844.88s)]
*  They're just saying there are some people that you don't want to really have them tell you what they're working on last week. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=848.48s)]
*  But other than that, I think everyone thought it was a pretty ingenious idea. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=854.52s)]
*  We have to find out where these people are. Who are they? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=858.24s)]
*  And we said, if you don't respond, we assume you're not around. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=861.36s)]
*  And that holds. That stands. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=865.48s)]
*  And you're not getting paid anymore, too. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=866.6800000000001s)]
*  So, you know, we're doing a real job. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=868.44s)]
*  And we just had a poll come out, I guess, the Harvard poll, saying that it's massively popular what we're doing. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=870.32s)]
*  Mr. President, do you still believe in NATO, in the alliance between Europe and America in NATO? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=877.6400000000001s)]
*  NATO is very much involved in this. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=885.7600000000001s)]
*  When I first got elected at the very beginning, first term, I got hundreds of billions of dollars put into NATO. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=888.96s)]
*  The NATO had no money because they hadn't paid for years. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=895.76s)]
*  And I said, look, if you don't pay, we're not going to be a part of NATO. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=898.72s)]
*  We're not going to protect. We're not going to do what we're supposed to do. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=902.2800000000001s)]
*  And we took in hundreds of billions of dollars into NATO. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=904.9200000000001s)]
*  No, NATO is a good thing if it's done properly and if it's used properly. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=909.4000000000001s)]
*  Mr. President, in these days, you speak a lot about the tariff in Canada, in Mexico and in Europe. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=913.24s)]
*  I want to know what is your idea about Italy, if you want to make the same thing. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=924.32s)]
*  About what? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=930.64s)]
*  Can you talk up a little louder? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=932.04s)]
*  In these days... [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=934.92s)]
*  No, louder. Can you talk a little louder? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=936.72s)]
*  You have a beautiful voice, but you don't... [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=938.84s)]
*  In these days, you speak... [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=941.08s)]
*  Where are you from? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=942.12s)]
*  Italy. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=943.12s)]
*  From Italy. Oh, I love Italy. Go ahead. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=944.12s)]
*  I want to know if you have the same idea with Italy about tariff. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=947.12s)]
*  Well, look, I love Italy. And Italy is a very important nation. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=954.12s)]
*  We have a wonderful woman as your leader. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=957.76s)]
*  And she was on the conversation today, one that we had, the G7. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=960.76s)]
*  And, no, I think Italy is doing very well. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=965.64s)]
*  I think Italy has got very strong leadership with Georgia. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=968.48s)]
*  Any other questions? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=978.48s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=979.48s)]
*  With respect to what? Russia? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=988.48s)]
*  In solving a peace deal, you said there would be major economic development transactions [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=989.6800000000001s)]
*  between the United States and Russia. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=994.6800000000001s)]
*  I think that would be a very good thing for world peace and lasting peace. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1019.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, our first... [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1022.6800000000001s)]
*  By far, our first thing that we want to do, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1025.68s)]
*  the first element of the overall transaction is ending the war. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1028.68s)]
*  But if, just as we're doing with Ukraine, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1033.68s)]
*  if we could do some economic development in terms of Russia [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1036.68s)]
*  and getting things that we want, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1040.68s)]
*  something like that would be a very good thing for the world. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1043.68s)]
*  If we could do some economic development in terms of Russia [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1046.88s)]
*  and getting things that we want, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1049.88s)]
*  something like that would be possible, yes. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1052.88s)]
*  Can you explain the rationale, sir, in the U.S. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1055.88s)]
*  Yes, go ahead, please. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1057.88s)]
*  Can you explain the rationale in having the U.S. vote against the U.N. resolution [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1058.88s)]
*  that Ukraine proposed and also the U.S. proposed? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1062.88s)]
*  I would rather not explain it now, but it's sort of self-evident, I think. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1065.88s)]
*  Is that still something you want to do today? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1070.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, it's not increasing, it's reciprocal. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1073.0800000000002s)]
*  So whatever they charge us, we're charging them. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1076.0800000000002s)]
*  So it's not a question of increasing. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1078.0800000000002s)]
*  If they charge us 20 percent, we charge them 20 percent. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1081.0800000000002s)]
*  If they charge us 30 or 40 percent, then we do that too. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1084.0800000000002s)]
*  So that would be on your opinion. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1087.0800000000002s)]
*  But that really would be with respect to everything. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1089.0800000000002s)]
*  It's reciprocity. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1093.0800000000002s)]
*  So reciprocal. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1095.0800000000002s)]
*  Whatever they charge us, we charge them. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1096.0800000000002s)]
*  Mr. President, are you thinking of going to Moscow soon, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1099.28s)]
*  maybe in May, the 9th of May for the anniversary? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1106.28s)]
*  I mean, not soon, but I would be certainly, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1109.28s)]
*  if this all gets settled down, which I think it will, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1112.28s)]
*  sure, I would go there. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1115.28s)]
*  And you'd come here too. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1116.28s)]
*  On the 9th of May for the Red Square? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1118.28s)]
*  I don't know, the 9th of May. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1121.28s)]
*  No, I think that's pretty soon. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1122.28s)]
*  But no, at the appropriate time, I would go to Moscow. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1125.28s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think the sending of French troops [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1128.48s)]
*  to Europe is a bad idea? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1130.48s)]
*  How soon? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1132.48s)]
*  Within weeks. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1133.48s)]
*  Weeks? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1135.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1136.48s)]
*  I think so. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1137.48s)]
*  You think so? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1138.48s)]
*  I'd like to ask have you, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1139.48s)]
*  I think we can end it within weeks if we're smart. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1140.48s)]
*  If we're not smart, it'll keep going and we'll keep losing [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1142.48s)]
*  young, beautiful people that shouldn't be dying. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1147.48s)]
*  And we don't want that. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1153.48s)]
*  And remember what I said. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1154.48s)]
*  This could escalate into a third world war. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1156.68s)]
*  And we don't want that either. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1159.68s)]
*  Mr. President, your envoy Steve Wischoff suggested [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1161.68s)]
*  a temporary ceasefire in the conflict, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1164.68s)]
*  but the Russian government has denied that out of hand. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1166.68s)]
*  Are you worried that they're not feeling in good faith? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1169.68s)]
*  No, I think they, at some point, will agree to that. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1171.68s)]
*  I think they probably want it to. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1174.68s)]
*  And I think once you have a ceasefire, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1176.68s)]
*  it's going to end because they're not going from [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1178.68s)]
*  a ceasefire back to war. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1180.68s)]
*  I think people have had their fall. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1182.68s)]
*  I'm just glad I was able to help because [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1185.88s)]
*  there was no communication with Russia [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1187.88s)]
*  until I came along. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1190.88s)]
*  Biden didn't communicate. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1191.88s)]
*  He couldn't communicate with his own child. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1192.88s)]
*  So Biden didn't communicate. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1195.88s)]
*  It was terrible. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1197.88s)]
*  He hadn't spoken to Putin in three years. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1198.88s)]
*  You're trying to end a war. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1201.88s)]
*  People are being killed. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1202.88s)]
*  Every week, thousands of people are being killed. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1203.88s)]
*  Soldiers, in this case, mostly. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1205.88s)]
*  Also towns, you know, as missiles go in and back and forth. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1207.88s)]
*  No, it's a shame. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1212.88s)]
*  This should have never happened. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1215.0800000000002s)]
*  This is a very sad. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1216.0800000000002s)]
*  This is going to go down in the history books. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1217.0800000000002s)]
*  This is a very sad moment because [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1219.0800000000002s)]
*  that should have been stopped. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1221.0800000000002s)]
*  That should have never started. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1223.0800000000002s)]
*  And if it did start, it should have stopped [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1224.0800000000002s)]
*  the first week, not three years later. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1227.0800000000002s)]
*  Okay? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1229.0800000000002s)]
*  Mr. President, if you'll allow me, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1230.0800000000002s)]
*  because I just, I think that [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1234.0800000000002s)]
*  several questions from you and your colleague [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1236.0800000000002s)]
*  have been asked in French [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1238.0800000000002s)]
*  and that you're joining the questions [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1239.0800000000002s)]
*  asked by the American colleagues. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1241.0800000000002s)]
*  First, this discussion is useful [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1243.28s)]
*  and building peace is a necessity. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1245.28s)]
*  The second thing is that [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1247.28s)]
*  there is today a capacity for dissuasion [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1249.28s)]
*  that has been restored [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1251.28s)]
*  and that's what President Trump means [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1253.28s)]
*  when he says there will be no more problems. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1255.28s)]
*  I think that the strength of the American re-engagement [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1257.28s)]
*  today is in a way [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1259.28s)]
*  the uncertainty also for President Putin. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1261.28s)]
*  And so there is a capacity for dissuasion [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1264.28s)]
*  that is there, that allows to seal [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1266.28s)]
*  first, without a doubt, a gap, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1268.28s)]
*  the capacity to verify that this gap is respected [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1270.28s)]
*  and then a peace agreement [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1272.48s)]
*  that will allow to rebuild Ukraine [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1274.48s)]
*  but also to provide security guarantees. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1276.48s)]
*  In the case of these security guarantees, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1278.48s)]
*  we think we have our role to play. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1280.48s)]
*  And so we'll see [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1282.48s)]
*  at that point in the discussion, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1284.48s)]
*  I don't want to present what is necessary [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1286.48s)]
*  for Ukraine to remain a sovereign country [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1288.48s)]
*  and besides, in the discussions between [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1290.48s)]
*  Ukraine and the United States of America, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1292.48s)]
*  there is this question of Ukrainian sovereignty [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1294.48s)]
*  that is respected. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1296.48s)]
*  And so, what we have prepared [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1298.48s)]
*  in particular with our British partners [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1300.68s)]
*  in the case of a very close work [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1302.68s)]
*  that we have carried out these last few weeks [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1304.68s)]
*  and shared with all European countries [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1306.68s)]
*  and allies who are ready to join [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1308.68s)]
*  is the idea of saying that we are ready to bring [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1310.68s)]
*  these security guarantees. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1312.68s)]
*  The conditions must be defined. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1314.68s)]
*  They must be defined by the agreement. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1316.68s)]
*  It can go as far as sending [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1318.68s)]
*  as the president said, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1320.68s)]
*  two troops who will have observed that the country [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1322.68s)]
*  is well respected, who will have positioned themselves [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1324.68s)]
*  not on the front line, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1326.68s)]
*  but in a way, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1328.88s)]
*  to be in the conflict, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1330.88s)]
*  but to mark a presence as a guarantee. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1332.88s)]
*  There are other means of supporting [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1334.88s)]
*  that can be support [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1336.88s)]
*  to the army, new structures, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1338.88s)]
*  but I also think that the agreement [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1340.88s)]
*  that is discussed, the president said it, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1342.88s)]
*  the American credibility that is put [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1344.88s)]
*  at this time, it is also to show [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1346.88s)]
*  that everyone is in their role, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1348.88s)]
*  but that we have a European and American unity [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1350.88s)]
*  and therefore with a form of guarantee [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1352.88s)]
*  that the Americans take [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1354.88s)]
*  by the discussion on the critical minarets [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1357.0800000000002s)]
*  that are finalizing. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1359.0800000000002s)]
*  As President Trump said, there won't be any more problems. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1387.0800000000002s)]
*  We've seen the US re-engagement [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1389.0800000000002s)]
*  and the message that that sends [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1391.0800000000002s)]
*  to Mr. Putin. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1393.0800000000002s)]
*  We have deterrence which will allow [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1395.0800000000002s)]
*  a truce to take place. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1397.0800000000002s)]
*  Verification of that truce and then a peace [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1399.0800000000002s)]
*  agreement can be put in place [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1401.0800000000002s)]
*  so that we can start rebuilding Ukraine [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1403.0800000000002s)]
*  with security guarantees [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1405.0800000000002s)]
*  and we have a role to play in that. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1407.0800000000002s)]
*  Again, I'm not preempting any discussions [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1409.0800000000002s)]
*  but we've spoken about Ukraine sovereignty [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1411.0800000000002s)]
*  and that has been a subject of discussion [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1413.0800000000002s)]
*  between the US and Ukraine. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1415.28s)]
*  We have also been working closely [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1417.28s)]
*  with our British partners [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1419.28s)]
*  this week. We've shared this information [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1421.28s)]
*  with other European countries [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1423.28s)]
*  and we are ready and willing to provide [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1425.28s)]
*  those security guarantees [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1427.28s)]
*  which could perhaps include troops [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1429.28s)]
*  but they would be there to maintain [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1431.28s)]
*  peace. They would not be along the front lines. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1433.28s)]
*  They would not be part of any conflict. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1435.28s)]
*  They would be there to ensure [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1437.28s)]
*  that the peace is respected. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1439.28s)]
*  Our assistance may include [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1441.28s)]
*  other capacity building perhaps [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1443.48s)]
*  for the military. We see [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1445.48s)]
*  US credibility here. We each have [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1447.48s)]
*  our role to play but it will be done [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1449.48s)]
*  in a united fashion. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1451.48s)]
*  The President, President Donald Trump [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1453.48s)]
*  and French President Manuel Macron [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1455.48s)]
*  holding a kind of an impromptu press conference [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1457.48s)]
*  there in the Oval Office after their [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1459.48s)]
*  meeting today at the White House. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1461.48s)]
*  They talk mostly about ending the war [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1463.48s)]
*  between Ukraine and Russia. Of course [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1465.48s)]
*  they also talked about some domestic [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1467.48s)]
*  issues including Doge [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1469.48s)]
*  firing hundreds of [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1471.68s)]
*  firing federal employees [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1473.68s)]
*  and putting them on notice. But they [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1475.68s)]
*  also talked about the special relationship [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1477.68s)]
*  these two countries had. The President [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1479.68s)]
*  President Trump saying that [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1481.68s)]
*  if they don't end the war with Russia [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1483.68s)]
*  it could lead to World War III if it's not [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1485.68s)]
*  solved. And he's expecting [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1487.68s)]
*  to see President Zelensky [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1489.68s)]
*  to come to the White House to sign [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1491.68s)]
*  an agreement later on this week. And he said [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1493.68s)]
*  he also plans to meet with Russian [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1495.68s)]
*  President Vladimir Putin. Let's bring in [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1497.68s)]
*  White House reporter Willie James [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1499.88s)]
*  Inman for more on this meeting. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1501.88s)]
*  Willie, I'm curious, what did you take away [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1503.88s)]
*  from this kind of impromptu press conference [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1505.88s)]
*  there? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1507.88s)]
*  Hey there Liz. Yeah, let's call this the pre [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1509.88s)]
*  press conference because the two leaders are [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1511.88s)]
*  set to have a press conference [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1513.88s)]
*  and take questions from reporters yet again. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1515.88s)]
*  That's going to happen a little bit later. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1517.88s)]
*  We anticipate the press [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1519.88s)]
*  going into that room soon. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1521.88s)]
*  But there was a lot, the President [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1523.88s)]
*  and the President of France talked about [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1525.88s)]
*  today. President Trump is saying [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1528.0800000000002s)]
*  essentially that he thinks [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1530.0800000000002s)]
*  peacekeepers, European peacekeepers [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1532.0800000000002s)]
*  could be on the table in terms [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1534.0800000000002s)]
*  of keeping the peace there in Ukraine. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1536.0800000000002s)]
*  It's unclear whether or not that'll [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1538.0800000000002s)]
*  be in the agreement. But everything is on the [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1540.0800000000002s)]
*  table it seems as the President [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1542.0800000000002s)]
*  talking here. He also mentioned [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1544.0800000000002s)]
*  that he would meet with President [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1546.0800000000002s)]
*  Zelensky of Ukraine as you talked about [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1548.0800000000002s)]
*  there. And part of that meeting would include [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1550.0800000000002s)]
*  signing a type of agreement [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1552.0800000000002s)]
*  for access to [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1554.0800000000002s)]
*  rare earth minerals that Ukraine [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1556.28s)]
*  holds in its territory for [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1558.28s)]
*  the U.S. to recoup. That's what [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1560.28s)]
*  White House officials have been saying. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1562.28s)]
*  Recoop some of the money and the funds [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1564.28s)]
*  that taxpayers have [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1566.28s)]
*  really sent to Ukraine in terms of that [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1568.28s)]
*  military assistance, the economic assistance [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1570.28s)]
*  that's going to Ukraine. President Trump [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1572.28s)]
*  hoping to make a deal there and saying that [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1574.28s)]
*  Zelensky, the President of Ukraine, could visit [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1576.28s)]
*  the White House and be in the Oval Office [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1578.28s)]
*  in those seats there perhaps [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1580.28s)]
*  later this week or next week. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1582.28s)]
*  The President also saying that he'll be willing to meet [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1584.48s)]
*  with President Putin of Russia. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1586.48s)]
*  We of course know that the [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1588.48s)]
*  U.S. officials have been meeting [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1590.48s)]
*  with Russian officials to lay the [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1592.48s)]
*  groundwork for that. Just last [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1594.48s)]
*  week of course that meeting taking place [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1596.48s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia with that [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1598.48s)]
*  country being the mediator between [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1600.48s)]
*  the U.S. and Russia. The President [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1602.48s)]
*  kind of didn't really commit [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1604.48s)]
*  necessarily to going to Moscow. Said he would be [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1606.48s)]
*  open to it if of course [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1608.48s)]
*  they could get this deal done with [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1610.48s)]
*  the U.S. and Russia. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1612.68s)]
*  And also he mentioned that [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1614.68s)]
*  it could lead to World War 3 [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1616.68s)]
*  if things weren't solved quickly. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1618.68s)]
*  And just quickly on Doge, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1620.68s)]
*  Liz, I want to mention that as well. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1622.68s)]
*  The President called it a genius idea. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1624.68s)]
*  This email that was really spearheaded [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1626.68s)]
*  by billionaire Elon Musk [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1628.68s)]
*  who's essentially the leader of Doge. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1630.68s)]
*  The White House says that he is not the leader of Doge. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1632.68s)]
*  But I'll note that Musk sent out a tweet [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1634.68s)]
*  saying that federal employees [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1636.68s)]
*  would be receiving an email telling them [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1638.68s)]
*  to ask them to explain [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1640.88s)]
*  what they've done over the past week. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1642.88s)]
*  And if they didn't respond, that would be [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1644.88s)]
*  taken as a resignation. The President going on [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1646.88s)]
*  to explain that saying that a lot of people [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1648.88s)]
*  aren't answering because they don't exist [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1650.88s)]
*  and saying that Doge has found hundreds [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1652.88s)]
*  of billions in fraud. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1654.88s)]
*  And he said that essentially it was a genius [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1656.88s)]
*  idea for sending this email out to federal [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1658.88s)]
*  employees. That has really caused a lot of confusion [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1660.88s)]
*  within the ranks [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1662.88s)]
*  of the federal government. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1664.88s)]
*  Because you have some agencies like the FBI, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1666.88s)]
*  the State Department, Department of Justice, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1669.0800000000002s)]
*  and others telling their employees not [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1671.0800000000002s)]
*  to respond to this email [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1673.0800000000002s)]
*  perhaps likely because some of [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1675.0800000000002s)]
*  the jobs that people do within the federal [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1677.0800000000002s)]
*  government contain classified [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1679.0800000000002s)]
*  or sensitive information. But [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1681.0800000000002s)]
*  nonetheless the President saying this was a genius [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1683.0800000000002s)]
*  idea to send this out. And this of course [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1685.0800000000002s)]
*  comes as the President works to [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1687.0800000000002s)]
*  rapidly downsize the federal workforce [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1689.0800000000002s)]
*  and cut spending lists. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1691.0800000000002s)]
*  Alright, Willie James-Emmon live for us at the White House [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1693.0800000000002s)]
*  where that meeting is taking place right now. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1695.0800000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much for that recap. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqc0YCcqBE&t=1697.08s)]
