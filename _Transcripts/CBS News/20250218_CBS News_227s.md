# Hamas says it will release 6 living hostages, Israel to begin talks on next phase of Gaza ceasefire
**CBS News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg)
*  All right. Israel says it will begin indirect negotiations with Hamas over phase two of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=0.0s)]
*  the Gaza ceasefire deal this week. This comes as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=4.32s)]
*  the deal has been made with the group to release six living hostages this weekend, and the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=8.48s)]
*  bodies of four deceased hostages are set to be handed over on Thursday. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  For more on the situation there, I'm joined by Will Todman. He's the chief of staff of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=16.94s)]
*  geopolitics and foreign policy department at the Center for Strategic and International [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=20.6s)]
*  Studies. He's also a senior fellow in the Middle East program at the Center. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=25.6s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us, Will. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=29.56s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=30.56s)]
*  So, these appear to be some positive developments for ensuring that ceasefire in Gaza continues. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=31.56s)]
*  What will both sides need to agree upon, though, to get that phase two off the ground? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=38.68s)]
*  Yeah, in many ways, the second phase of the ceasefire agreement is going to be even more [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=43.08s)]
*  challenging than the first, because now we're getting into bigger questions about the future [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=49.08s)]
*  Who will rule the Gaza Strip? Who is going to fund reconstruction in Gaza? And are Israeli [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=55.24s)]
*  troops going to completely withdraw from this area? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  So on the first question, Israel has very clearly stated that they do not want Hamas [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=66.12s)]
*  to play any role at all in the future of the ruling or the governance of the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=72.6s)]
*  And Hamas have actually expressed an openness to this. They've said they're either open [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=79.56s)]
*  to a technocratic government or to a new Palestinian national government. That is a [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=83.7s)]
*  proposal that the Egyptians have been pushing. But we're getting into a fraught stage now. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=90.42s)]
*  And so these questions are going to be tackled by an increasing number of international actors. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=97.10000000000001s)]
*  Of course, the United States is a key actor here. But also a lot of Arab states are very [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=102.62s)]
*  keen to see now a future for the Gaza Strip that does not involve the mass displacement [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  of Palestinians from Gaza, as President Trump has proposed. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=114.69999999999999s)]
*  So let's turn to Israel's northern border now, where Lebanon has criticized Israel's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=120.61999999999999s)]
*  decision to keep troops stationed at five locations within the country despite today's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=124.78s)]
*  deadline to withdraw as part of that ceasefire agreement. Could we see any fighting flare [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=129.29999999999998s)]
*  up again with Hezbollah? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=133.85999999999999s)]
*  We certainly could see fighting flare up again. As you said, this was the deadline under the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=137.02s)]
*  terms of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah for all Israeli troops to withdraw. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=142.62s)]
*  And they have withdrawn from populated areas in the south of the country, but they have [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=150.06s)]
*  not withdrawn from these five strategic positions along the border. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=154.3s)]
*  Now, Israeli officials say that Israeli troops need an ongoing presence there to ensure that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=158.74s)]
*  Hezbollah abides by the terms of the ceasefire, does not rearm and is not able to continue [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=165.58s)]
*  to pose a threat to Israel. But at the same time, the UN has said that the ongoing presence [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=171.38000000000002s)]
*  of Israeli troops is a violation of the terms of the ceasefire. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=178.70000000000002s)]
*  The new government in Lebanon that was just formed has already taken several steps to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=182.34s)]
*  sideline Hezbollah, and the Lebanese army is slowly taking back control and redeploying [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=188.54000000000002s)]
*  to the south of the country in an effort to squeeze Hezbollah and constrain it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=194.28s)]
*  But Hezbollah, although severely downgraded, maintains significant weapons and the ability [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=199.68s)]
*  to restart fighting if it feels that this really is an existential threat. So I think [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=208.44s)]
*  we're not out of the woods yet, and we could see a renewal, an uptick of violence in the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=213.56s)]
*  days and weeks ahead. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=219.6s)]
*  All right. Fascinating analysis, as always. Will Todman, thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpuhcliNWg&t=221.08s)]
