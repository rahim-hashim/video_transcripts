# What to know about this week's Trump Cabinet confirmation hearings
**CBS News:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg)
*  It's going to be a whirlwind week of confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=0.0s)]
*  More than a dozen of president-elect Donald Trump's administration picks will be getting [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=4.28s)]
*  grilled by lawmakers, and that's going to begin as soon as tomorrow. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=7.9s)]
*  Fourteen are up for questioning this week alone. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=11.38s)]
*  That includes Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth, who begins the process tomorrow, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  and Trump's choice for attorney general, Pam Bondi, who will appear twice. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=17.92s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader John Thune told CBS News many will get through, but, quote, we'll [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=21.72s)]
*  see about all of them. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=26.28s)]
*  Chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes joins me now to discuss. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=28.96s)]
*  She's in West Palm Beach, Florida. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=31.92s)]
*  All right, Nancy, good to see you. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=33.6s)]
*  What's the latest that you're hearing on the push to release Pete Hegseth's FBI background [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=36.24s)]
*  check before his hearing, which will begin tomorrow? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=42.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=45.64s)]
*  This is a big fight on Capitol Hill, Vlad. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=46.64s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, as you'll recall, faced a really bumpy start to his confirmation process. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=51.04s)]
*  Lots of questions raised about mismanagement of both staff and finances at a couple of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=58.68s)]
*  veterans groups, questions about sexual misconduct in the past, questions about his personal [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=65.2s)]
*  behavior, and those questions linger. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=72.12s)]
*  Republicans had argued, look, the FBI is going to look into all of this, and then we'll have [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  all the facts. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=80.44s)]
*  Well, the FBI has looked into it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=81.44s)]
*  It has shared what it found with the top Democrat and the top Republican on the Armed [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  Services Committee, which will be holding the hearing tomorrow, the confirmation hearing [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=88.52s)]
*  for Hegseth. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=93.92s)]
*  But there are other members of that committee who are saying, hey, I'd really like to see [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=94.92s)]
*  what's in that background report as well, mostly Democrats. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  In fact, all Democrats right now who are saying they have deep concerns about Hegseth, they [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=101.64s)]
*  want to know exactly what the FBI found. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=106.44s)]
*  Republicans are pushing back. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=110.08s)]
*  They say this is standard protocol. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=111.6s)]
*  That information simply goes to the chair of the committee, the ranking member of the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=113.72s)]
*  committee, and then it filters down. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  Democrats are arguing this is a special case. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=121.8s)]
*  In the words of Tammy Duckworth, the Democratic senator from Illinois who is on the committee, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  who is a veteran herself who lost her legs in combat, she says, Pete Hegseth has managed [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  fewer people than the manager of an Applebee's and therefore deserves additional scrutiny. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=135.84s)]
*  This confirmation hearing is going to be quite a barn burner tomorrow, Vlad. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=142.56s)]
*  So, Nancy, during that confirmation hearing, the information that was gathered for this [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  FBI background check, will members of the Senate use... [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=151.24s)]
*  I'm wondering, how does it play into the confirmation hearings? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  How are senators prepared to ask questions if they are not familiar with whatever that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=159.08s)]
*  FBI background check came up with? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=164.84s)]
*  Well, whether they have the information or not, there are still a lot of questions they're [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=169.44s)]
*  going to ask. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=172.84s)]
*  They're going to ask about allegations of sexual misconduct. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=174.08s)]
*  They're going to ask him, for example, are you facing any other lawsuits that we don't [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=176.96s)]
*  know about? Are you facing any other allegations that could interfere with your ability to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=181.24s)]
*  run the largest military on Earth? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  They'd like to have all the facts before them when they ask those questions. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=189.72000000000003s)]
*  They'd like to know what the FBI found as pertains to those questions. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=192.92s)]
*  If they don't have it, it's not going to stop them from asking. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=198.32s)]
*  It's just going to mean that they're going to have to either take Hegseth's word for it [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=201.48s)]
*  or they're just going to press him all that much harder to try to get to the truth. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  All right, Nancy, quarters for us this morning. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=212.92s)]
*  Nancy, thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=214.44s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlmN0dB5Yvg&t=217.76s)]
