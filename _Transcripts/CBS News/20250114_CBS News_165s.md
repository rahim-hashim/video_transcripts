# Part one of Jack Smith report on Trump investigation released
**CBS News:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU)
*  But first, this breaking story for you overnight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=0.0s)]
*  Part one of the final report on the investigation [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=2.64s)]
*  into President-elect Donald Trump [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=5.64s)]
*  by former special counsel Jack Smith has been made public. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=7.2s)]
*  It details his investigative findings [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=11.28s)]
*  in the federal 2020 election interference case. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=13.32s)]
*  And it reads in part, quote, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=16.52s)]
*  the office assessed that the admissible evidence [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=18.6s)]
*  was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=20.88s)]
*  In response to that report, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=25.8s)]
*  Trump posted on Truth Social early this morning, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=27.56s)]
*  calling it, quote, fake findings. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=30.08s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss this report [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=32.76s)]
*  is CBS News political reporter and attorney Katrina Kaufman. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=34.32s)]
*  Katrina, the report seems crystal clear. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=37.44s)]
*  I'm wondering what stands out to you most from Jack Smith. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=39.96s)]
*  Errol, it's really interesting [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=44.2s)]
*  to see this final report from Jack Smith. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=45.68s)]
*  And one thing that stands out is the quote you mentioned, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  which is his confidence that had they gone to trial [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=51.4s)]
*  with this case that Trump would have been convicted. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=54.76s)]
*  And we have to remember that is on top of his other conviction [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=58.32s)]
*  in his New York criminal trial, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=61.8s)]
*  where he was just sentenced [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=63.2s)]
*  and made a convicted felon entering this office. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=64.76s)]
*  Some other things that stood out are we really got some insight [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  into the thought process behind these charges, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=72.32s)]
*  behind the case. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=75.8s)]
*  For instance, Jack Smith talked about [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=77.12s)]
*  why they didn't bring the charge of insurrection, for example, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=79.0s)]
*  which people had wondered. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=82.52s)]
*  And he talked about how there was really no precedent for it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=84.04s)]
*  They were worried that with Trump being a sitting president [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=86.6s)]
*  at the time that it wouldn't necessarily be successful. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=89.68s)]
*  And they really wanted to make sure [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=92.4s)]
*  that the case they brought against Trump [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=94.88s)]
*  was going to be airtight. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=96.88s)]
*  Another thing he mentioned was that in a letter [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  to Merrick Garland that went with this, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=102.64s)]
*  that this decision to prosecute Trump was his alone. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=104.72s)]
*  And I think that's significant in the context of Trump [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=108.76s)]
*  saying that he is going to exact retribution [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=112.08s)]
*  on the people who have brought these cases against him. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=114.72s)]
*  And it's a fascinating read. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  Our viewers really should dive into it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  Where do we stand with the other case [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  that Smith was prosecuting? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=125.12s)]
*  So there is still the Florida classified documents case. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=127.4s)]
*  Smith has dropped that against Donald Trump, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=130.56s)]
*  although it's without prejudice, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=133.24s)]
*  so it could be brought back later. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=134.56s)]
*  But he's trying to reinstate the case in the 11th circuit [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=136.28s)]
*  against Trump's co-defendants. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=139.6s)]
*  And actually he's turned this case over [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=141.64s)]
*  to the US District Attorney of Miami. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=143.4s)]
*  And there's also still going to be a hearing actually [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=146.2s)]
*  on Friday about the part of Smith's report [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  related to that classified documents case, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=152.88s)]
*  which they want to present as some top members of Congress. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  But Trump and his co-defendants are trying to block that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  All right, Katrina Kaufman, live for us from our DC Bureau. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=162.04s)]
*  Katrina, thank you. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyd7mXI-hU&t=164.64s)]
