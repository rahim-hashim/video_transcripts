# Trump delivers inauguration address as 47th U.S. president
**CBS News:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg)
*  To introduce to you the 45th and the 47th President of the United States of America, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald J. Trump. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=8.5s)]
*  Thank you very much everybody. Well, thank you very very much. Vice President Vance, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=30.0s)]
*  Speaker Johnson, Senator Thune, Chief Justice Roberts, justices of the United States Supreme [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=51.0s)]
*  Court, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, President Biden, Vice President [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=62.1s)]
*  Harris, and my fellow citizens. The golden age of America begins right now. From this day forward, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=72.64s)]
*  our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world. We will be the envy of every [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=90.72s)]
*  nation and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer. During every single day of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=97.52s)]
*  the Trump administration, I will very simply put America first. Our sovereignty will be reclaimed, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=105.96s)]
*  our safety will be restored, the scales of justice will be rebalanced, the vicious, violent, and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=124.16000000000001s)]
*  unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end. And our top priority will [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=133.12s)]
*  be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous, and free. America will soon be greater, stronger, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=148.16000000000003s)]
*  and far more exceptional than ever before. I return to the presidency confident and optimistic [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=162.56s)]
*  that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success. A tide of change is sweeping [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=174.72s)]
*  the country, sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=182.0s)]
*  opportunity like never before. But first, we must be honest about the challenges we face. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=188.4s)]
*  While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=195.6s)]
*  witnessing in the United States of America. As we gather today, our government confronts a crisis [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=201.2s)]
*  of trust. For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=208.32s)]
*  our citizens, while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=215.11999999999998s)]
*  We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home, while at the same time [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=222.72s)]
*  stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad. It fails to protect [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=228.4s)]
*  our magnificent law-abiding American citizens, but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions that have illegally entered our country from all [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  over the world. We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  borders, but refuses to defend American borders or, more importantly, its own people. Our country can [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=254.64s)]
*  no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=263.44s)]
*  people of North Carolina, who have been treated so badly, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=270.56s)]
*  and other states who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=279.36s)]
*  Or more recently, Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=284.8s)]
*  from weeks ago without even a token of defense. They're raging through the houses and communities, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=290.8s)]
*  even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  some of whom are sitting here right now. They don't have a home any longer. That's interesting. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  But we can't let this happen. Everyone is unable to do anything about it that's going to change. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=310.4s)]
*  We have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=318.56s)]
*  spent on it than any country anywhere in the world. And we have an education system that teaches our [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=323.36s)]
*  children to be ashamed of themselves, in many cases, to hate our country despite the love that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=330.08s)]
*  we try so desperately to provide to them. All of this will change starting today, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=336.0s)]
*  and it will change very quickly. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=343.2s)]
*  My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=355.68s)]
*  and all of these many betrayals that have taken place, and to give the people back their faith, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=363.28s)]
*  their wealth, their democracy, and indeed their freedom. From this moment on, America's decline [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=370.88s)]
*  is over. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=380.8s)]
*  Our liberties and our nation's glorious destiny will no longer be denied, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=388.08s)]
*  and we will immediately restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of America's government. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=397.84s)]
*  Over the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in our 250-year [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=404.88s)]
*  history, and I've learned a lot along the way. The journey to reclaim our republic has not been [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=410.64s)]
*  an easy one, that I can tell you. Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=419.68s)]
*  and indeed to take my life. Just a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin's [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=427.84s)]
*  bullet ripped through my ear, but I felt then, and believe even more so now, that my life was saved [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=435.44s)]
*  for a reason. I was saved by God to make America great again. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=444.32s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=465.44s)]
*  That is why each day, under our administration of American patriots, we will be working to meet [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=480.8s)]
*  every crisis with dignity and power and strength. We will move with purpose and speed to bring back [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=488.56s)]
*  hope, prosperity, safety, and peace for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=495.92s)]
*  For American citizens, January 20, 2025 is Liberation Day. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=504.8s)]
*  It is my hope that our recent presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=518.56s)]
*  consequential election in the history of our country. As our victory showed, the entire nation [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=526.7199999999999s)]
*  is rapidly unifying behind our agenda, with dramatic increases in support from virtually [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=533.3599999999999s)]
*  every element of our society, young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=539.3599999999999s)]
*  Asian Americans, urban, suburban, rural, and very importantly, we had a powerful win in all [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=546.4s)]
*  seven swing states and the popular vote we won by millions of people. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=553.68s)]
*  To the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=564.8s)]
*  trust that you have shown me with your vote. We set records and I will not forget it. I've heard [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=571.2s)]
*  your voices in the campaign and I look forward to working with you in the years to come. Today is [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=580.32s)]
*  Martin Luther King Day and his honor, this will be a great honor, but in his honor we will strive [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=586.6400000000001s)]
*  together to make his dream a reality. We will make his dream come true. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=594.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=601.2s)]
*  National unity is now returning to America and confidence and pride is soaring [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=619.44s)]
*  like never before. In everything we do, my administration will be inspired by a strong [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=627.92s)]
*  pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success. We will not forget our country, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=633.68s)]
*  we will not forget our constitution, and we will not forget our God. Can't do that. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=639.6s)]
*  Today I will sign a series of historic executive orders. With these actions, we will begin the [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=657.68s)]
*  complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. It's all about common sense. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=665.8399999999999s)]
*  First, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=675.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=687.6s)]
*  All illegal entry will immediately be halted and we will begin the process of returning millions [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=707.6s)]
*  and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=714.96s)]
*  We will reinstate my remain in Mexico policy. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=720.96s)]
*  I will end the practice of catch and release. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=731.6800000000001s)]
*  And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=734.72s)]
*  Under the orders I signed today, we will also be [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=750.64s)]
*  designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=754.64s)]
*  And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=760.48s)]
*  I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=782.64s)]
*  enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=787.68s)]
*  bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=793.28s)]
*  As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=807.8399999999999s)]
*  from threats and invasions. And that is exactly what I am going to do. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=812.48s)]
*  Next, I will direct all members of my Cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=822.24s)]
*  to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=827.84s)]
*  The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=834.56s)]
*  And that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=839.68s)]
*  America will be a manufacturing nation once again. And we have something that no other [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=864.4s)]
*  manufacturing nation will ever have. The largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=881.04s)]
*  We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=887.6s)]
*  and export American energy all over the world. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=901.36s)]
*  We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=905.84s)]
*  With my actions today, we will end the Green New Deal and we will revoke the electric vehicle [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=918.5600000000001s)]
*  mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American auto workers. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=924.32s)]
*  In other words, you will be able to buy the car of your choice. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=935.2s)]
*  We will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=949.36s)]
*  dreamt possible just a few years ago. And thank you to the auto workers of our nation [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=953.5200000000001s)]
*  for your inspiring vote of confidence. We did tremendously with their vote. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=959.52s)]
*  I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=967.28s)]
*  and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=974.3199999999999s)]
*  we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=979.92s)]
*  For this purpose, we are establishing the [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=989.92s)]
*  external revenue service to collect all tariffs, duties, and revenues. It will be massive amounts [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=996.16s)]
*  of money pouring into our treasury coming from foreign sources. The American Dream will soon [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1005.4399999999999s)]
*  be back and thriving like never before to restore competence and effectiveness to our federal [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1012.16s)]
*  government. My administration will establish the brand new Department of Government Efficiency. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1018.4s)]
*  After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1038.32s)]
*  free expression, I will also sign an executive order to immediately stop [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1043.76s)]
*  all government censorship and bring back free speech to America. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1048.8s)]
*  Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1055.12s)]
*  Something I know something about. We will not allow that to happen. It will not happen again [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1077.9199999999998s)]
*  under my leadership. We will restore fair, equal, and impartial justice under the constitutional rule [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1085.04s)]
*  of law. And we are going to bring law and order back to our cities. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1092.0s)]
*  This week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1107.1200000000001s)]
*  and gender into every aspect of public and private life. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1114.0s)]
*  We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1125.52s)]
*  As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1136.8s)]
*  are only two genders, male and female. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1143.68s)]
*  This week, I will reinstate any service members who were unjustly expelled from our military for [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1165.04s)]
*  objecting to the COVID vaccine mandate with full back pain. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1170.96s)]
*  And I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1187.6000000000001s)]
*  theories and social experiments while on duty. It's going to end immediately. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1193.36s)]
*  Our armed forces will be free to focus on their sole mission, defeating America's enemies. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1202.32s)]
*  And like in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1223.4399999999998s)]
*  We will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1242.6399999999999s)]
*  and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1249.28s)]
*  My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That's what I want to be, a peacemaker [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1259.68s)]
*  and a unifier. I'm pleased to say that as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1280.3200000000002s)]
*  the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1287.8400000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1303.36s)]
*  America will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1314.4799999999998s)]

*  to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, and we will restore the name [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1328.16s)]
*  of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1338.16s)]
*  President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1345.44s)]
*  He was a natural businessman and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1360.64s)]
*  he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1366.32s)]
*  after the United States. The United States, I mean, think of this, spent more money than [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1373.28s)]
*  ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1379.68s)]
*  We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1388.24s)]
*  and Panama's promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1393.52s)]
*  has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1401.2s)]
*  in any way, shape, or form, and that includes the United States Navy. And above all, China is [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1409.52s)]
*  operating the Panama Canal, and we didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we're taking [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1417.44s)]
*  it back. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1423.6s)]
*  Above all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1441.9199999999998s)]
*  vigor, and the vitality of history's greatest civilization. So as we liberate our nation, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1448.32s)]
*  we will lead it to new heights of victory and success. We will not be deterred. Together, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1455.28s)]
*  we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy, and disease-free. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1462.96s)]
*  The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1469.6s)]
*  our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations, and carries our [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1476.0s)]
*  flag into new and beautiful horizons. And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1482.32s)]
*  launching American astronauts to plant the stars and stripes on the planet Mars. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1489.28s)]
*  And ambition is the lifeblood of a great nation. And right now, our nation is more ambitious than [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1506.0s)]
*  any other. There's no nation like our nation. Americans are explorers, builders, innovators, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1524.88s)]
*  entrepreneurs, and pioneers. The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1531.92s)]
*  The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls. Our American ancestors [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1538.3200000000002s)]
*  turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1548.0s)]
*  extraordinary citizens on Earth. No one comes close. Americans pushed thousands of miles [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1554.72s)]
*  through a rugged land of untamed wilderness. They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1561.8400000000001s)]
*  untold dangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1569.1200000000001s)]
*  lifted billions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched mankind [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1576.16s)]
*  into the heavens, and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1582.88s)]
*  If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1590.3200000000002s)]
*  Many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1596.4s)]
*  but as you see today, here I am. The American people have spoken. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1602.56s)]
*  I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1620.24s)]
*  In America, the impossible is what we do best. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1634.24s)]
*  From New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1637.92s)]
*  to right here in Washington, D.C., our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1652.24s)]
*  who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom. They were farmers and soldiers, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1659.92s)]
*  cowboys and factory workers, steelworkers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1667.36s)]
*  pushed onward, marched forward, and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1674.08s)]
*  Together, they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1681.28s)]
*  won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed over every single challenge that [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1688.7199999999998s)]
*  they faced. After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1696.72s)]
*  greatest years in American history. With your help, we will restore America's promise and we [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1702.96s)]
*  will rebuild the nation that we love, and we love it so much. We are one people, one family, and one [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1710.32s)]
*  glorious nation under God, so to every parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1716.8s)]
*  for their future, I am with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you. We are going to win [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1724.4s)]

*  make it great again, greater than ever before. We will be a nation like no other, full of [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1758.88s)]
*  compassion, courage, and exceptionalism. Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1765.5200000000002s)]
*  to a world that has been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable. America will be respected [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1773.3600000000001s)]
*  again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith, and goodwill. We will be prosperous. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1780.24s)]

*  We will not be intimidated. We will not be broken, and we will not fail. From this day on, the United [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1796.4s)]
*  States of America will be a free, sovereign, and independent nation. We will stand bravely. We will [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1804.4s)]

*  The inaugural address of the 47th President of the United States, Donald Trump, it was billed as an [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1835.68s)]
*  optimistic and hopeful address. Donald Trump said he wants to be a peacemaker and a unifier, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1841.36s)]
*  promising to put America first and to usher in a revolution of common sense. In his words, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1847.6s)]
*  you just heard him say, our golden age has just begun. But he then plunged into a list of grievances, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1854.08s)]
*  said from this moment on, America's decline is over. We're going to dig into the details of this [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1861.76s)]
*  speech, but I think first we want to hear from Carrie Underwood, who is set to deliver [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1870.48s)]
*  America the Beautiful, and then we'll talk about some of the details that President Donald Trump [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1877.44s)]
*  just outlined in his inaugural address, describing a liberation day, saying too that they will declare [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1884.56s)]
*  a crisis on the southern border and that in his words, we will be a rich nation again. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1893.68s)]
*  Donald Trump also using an inaugural address to say there are only two genders, male and female, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1902.3200000000002s)]
*  also talking about full back pay for those who refuse the COVID vaccine. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1909.04s)]
*  It sounds like they're just trying to get the music ready to hear from [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1915.8400000000001s)]
*  Carrie Underwood, this remarkable moment where you see five presidents of the United States [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1920.0s)]
*  in one room. It was more like a State of the Union than an inaugural address in many ways, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1926.72s)]
*  and that's in part because of the location inside the Capitol Rotunda, as opposed to out on that [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1932.32s)]
*  inaugural platform. And so people stood and applauded. That's not something we usually see [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1938.8s)]
*  in an inaugural address, but it was notable that none of the former presidents stood up [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1944.64s)]
*  and applauded throughout his remarks, including the former Republican President, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1951.2s)]
*  George W. Bush. That's what I was just going to say. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1956.4s)]
*  Yeah, the leader party. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1959.04s)]
*  Nora, it was interesting to hear the now president say, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1959.92s)]
*  I was saved by God to make America great, talking about that attempt on his life [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1962.96s)]
*  back in July. So he believes he doesn't just have a political mandate, he believes he has some mandate [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1968.48s)]
*  from the divine in seeing out the next four years. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1974.32s)]
*  And, John Dickerson, you've looked at so many of these inaugural addresses. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1978.64s)]
*  Donald Trump has always had a different style. His last one was described as dark. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1983.28s)]
*  How would you describe this one? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7xC19wsgPg&t=1987.84s)]
