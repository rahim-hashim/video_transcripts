# Jordan's King Abdullah II arrives in D.C. for Trump meeting
**CBS News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q)
*  Any moment at the White House, a highly anticipated face to face meeting between President Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=0.0s)]
*  and the King of Jordan comes on the heels of Trump's controversial plan for the U.S. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=8.32s)]
*  to take over Gaza. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  Today's meeting follows the warning about Trump, from Trump rather, about what he'll [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=16.12s)]
*  do if Jordan does not agree to take in Palestinian refugees. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=20.56s)]
*  Listen in. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=24.88s)]
*  Jordanian leaders coming in to see you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=26.439999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  Folks in Jordan have expressed opposition to taking in more Gazans, more Palestinians. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  How do you want to convince them to do otherwise? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=35.08s)]
*  I think he'll take. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=37.4s)]
*  I mean, I do think he'll take and I think other countries will take also. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=38.4s)]
*  They have good hearts. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=41.4s)]
*  I think they'll take. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=42.84s)]
*  Back on Gaza, you talked with Fox News about the billions of dollars we pay for Jordan [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=43.84s)]
*  and Egypt every year. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=49.44s)]
*  Would you withhold aid to these countries if they don't agree to take in the Palestinians? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=55.8s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=56.8s)]
*  Why not? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=57.8s)]
*  You mean if they don't agree? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=58.8s)]
*  If they don't agree, I would, I would conceivably withhold. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=59.8s)]
*  Now let's bring in CBS News Senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=65.08s)]
*  Ed, first off, thank you so much for joining us on the stream today. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=70.24s)]
*  Let's talk about those comments we just heard from the president. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=74.8s)]
*  Is that enough to sway the king here? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=77.12s)]
*  We'll go. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=79.64s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=80.92s)]
*  You may have seen that vehicle who pulled that pulled up right behind me there. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=82.16s)]
*  That is the king arriving as we speak. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=84.96s)]
*  So your timing is impeccable. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=87.08s)]
*  We will see. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=89.46s)]
*  This is likely to be one of the most contentious meetings the King of Jordan's ever had with [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=90.46s)]
*  an American president as there they are as they head in here by the West Wing entrance, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=94.0s)]
*  the president coming out to greet King Abdullah and his son, the crown prince, who are here [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=99.96s)]
*  for their first meeting of the second Trump administration, the king and increasingly [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=104.38s)]
*  the crown prince. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=109.44s)]
*  No strangers to the White House. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=110.44s)]
*  They are among the most frequent world leaders to visit an American president given their [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=112.72s)]
*  geopolitical importance, given the fact that they rely so much on American assistance, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=118.2s)]
*  both security and financial. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=122.96s)]
*  This though, expected to be, as I said, the most contentious meeting the king has had [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=124.92s)]
*  with an American president, at least in a while, maybe since the Iraq war. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=128.28s)]
*  Given what President Trump has been suggesting in recent days that perhaps Jordan and Egypt [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=134.06s)]
*  should help relocate the roughly two million people who live in the Gaza Strip, clear it [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=139.54s)]
*  out so that it can be redeveloped and overnight now suggesting that perhaps they would not [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=144.57999999999998s)]
*  be able to return. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=149.34s)]
*  Jordan and Egypt, of course, strongly oppose this idea for a few reasons. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=150.73999999999998s)]
*  First of all, their belief that they are entitled to stay where they are and that it is land [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=153.89999999999998s)]
*  that has settled Palestinian territory and should remain such. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=159.7s)]
*  But perhaps more urgently to them, the political and economic strain that this would put on [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=163.54s)]
*  both of those countries, that without American assistance or international assistance, they [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=169.34s)]
*  simply couldn't do it and they've been overwhelmed as it is by strife across the Middle East [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=174.02s)]
*  in recent years, both in the Gaza Strip and in Syria. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=179.22s)]
*  So we'll see what the king says as he comes out of this meeting, if anything, about how [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=181.98000000000002s)]
*  it went with the president. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=187.42000000000002s)]
*  But what the president is also suggesting is the kind of public statement he makes that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=188.5s)]
*  shocks and awes and may eventually lead to some other kind of resolution. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=193.22s)]
*  The Panama Canal, the idea of taking Greenland from Denmark. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=198.02s)]
*  And now these comments, of course, the issue with these comments is they have the potential [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=201.38s)]
*  to really cause more violence and a disruption of the ceasefire agreement, given what he [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=206.26000000000002s)]
*  said yesterday as well, regarding the possibility that if Hamas doesn't release the rest of [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=212.52s)]
*  its hostages by noon on Saturday, then quote, all hell might break loose. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=216.86s)]
*  Yes, and very strong words from the president there. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=221.46s)]
*  We'll wait and see what comes out of the meeting today with the king of Jordan. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=225.45999999999998s)]
*  And Ed, the president did not hold back while answering questions from reporters just yesterday. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=229.38s)]
*  So let's listen to what else he had to say about hostages in Gaza. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=233.98s)]
*  Well, I would say this, and I'm going to let that because that's Israel's decision. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=237.85999999999999s)]
*  But as far as I'm concerned, if all of the hostages aren't returned by Saturday at 12 [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=243.1s)]
*  o'clock, I think it's an appropriate time. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=249.62s)]
*  I would say cancel it and all bets are off and let hell break out. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=252.42s)]
*  I'd say they ought to be returned by 12 o'clock on Saturday. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=258.82s)]
*  And if they're not returned, all of them not in drips and drabs, not two and one and three [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=261.97999999999996s)]
*  and four and two. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=266.97999999999996s)]
*  Ed, what has been the response from Israel on what we just heard from the president there? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=269.53999999999996s)]
*  Because clearly you have family members still waiting for their loved ones to come home. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=273.74s)]
*  Most immediately, we've seen Israeli defense forces begin to mobilize for the possibility [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=278.7s)]
*  of more chaos and violence across the region. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=284.06s)]
*  They've canceled leave and they've called back troops. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=287.46s)]
*  The Israeli security cabinet was to be meeting this afternoon to come up with some kind of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=289.58s)]
*  a response to this or waiting to see what exactly the Israeli government makes of it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=293.82s)]
*  But what the president may be suggesting here or foreshadowing is that this carefully negotiated [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=297.53999999999996s)]
*  ceasefire agreement that his team was involved in during the transition may be on the verge [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=302.5s)]
*  of collapse unless Israel and Hamas come to some kind of an agreement to continue the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=307.44s)]
*  release of hostages. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=311.84s)]
*  Remember, the comments come from the president after the Israeli public and much of the world [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=312.84s)]
*  has been shocked by the appearance of three Israeli hostages who came out appearing to [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=317.34s)]
*  be physically quite affected by what had gone on over their 400 plus days of captivity and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=322.72s)]
*  the violence they say that they endured while in captivity. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=328.72s)]
*  And so there's concern about continuing to prolong the inevitable release of these hostages [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=332.28s)]
*  and instead the president suggesting that perhaps why can't it be done much faster? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=337.12s)]
*  That he's raising doubts about it though follows up on some comments that were made by his [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=341.52s)]
*  Mideast negotiator last week suggesting that they'd inherited a deal that wasn't entirely [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=345.8s)]
*  of their making. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=349.84s)]
*  So we very well could be on the verge of violence breaking out again unless we see some kind [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=351.2s)]
*  of attempt by the Israeli government as the president suggested there to figure out with [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=355.68s)]
*  Hamas what to do next. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=359.44s)]
*  Okay, Ed O'Keefe, thank you so much for joining us on the stream today. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=361.15999999999997s)]
*  Appreciate your time. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-I2LRNLw4Q&t=364.8s)]
