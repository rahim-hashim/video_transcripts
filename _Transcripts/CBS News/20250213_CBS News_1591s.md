# Trump, India's Modi take questions about tariffs, immigration
**CBS News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw)
*  But we do want to take you back to the White House where President Trump and Prime Minister Modi are taking questions. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=0.0s)]
*  We have seen several groups in the US being raising anti-India voice, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=4.84s)]
*  calling about separation, terrorism activities in India. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=10.08s)]
*  Do you think that should continue here in the US as well? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=13.32s)]
*  You're going to have to go louder. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=16.32s)]
*  Mr. President, people in India would be welcoming your decision to extradite the HUB or RANA to India. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  I can't understand a word he's saying. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=23.2s)]
*  May I, sir? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=25.64s)]
*  May I? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=27.04s)]
*  May I, sir? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  Go ahead, back there. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  Mr. President, thank you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=31.639999999999997s)]
*  First, I want to ask the Prime Minister a question. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=33.239999999999995s)]
*  You and the President, you both spoke about combating ISIS. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=36.68s)]
*  You both sounded very excited about this partnership upcoming. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=40.04s)]
*  And I was curious, how much more confident are you with President Trump leading this country [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=45.959999999999994s)]
*  that there will be peace through strength and you will have a successful partnership with the United States [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  versus with Biden's incompetence and weakness over the last four years? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=59.04s)]
*  That's your question, but I'll answer it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=74.2s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, gross incompetence. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=77.88s)]
*  We're going to have a fantastic relationship. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=80.8s)]
*  And it has been like the whole world has been set back over the last four years by the weakness of the United States, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=82.8s)]
*  the weak leadership of the United States. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=88.92s)]
*  But I think we've taken care of it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=90.72s)]
*  In just three weeks, it seems to me that even some of the media that we wouldn't prefer has been writing [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=92.48s)]
*  that this is a much different country right now, that the world has a light over it, not only our country, but the whole world. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=99.72s)]
*  The Prime Minister told me that before, too, even over India. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=106.68s)]
*  The world has a light. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=109.44s)]
*  They need the United States to be strong and powerful, but good. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=110.44s)]
*  And I think that's happened. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=115.04s)]
*  And I think it's happened in a very short period of time. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=116.48s)]
*  But I will tell you, we're going to have a fantastic relationship and it'll make both countries much stronger. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=118.76s)]
*  OK, Geeta Mohan from India Today. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=136.52s)]
*  So I'll just take my colleague Lalit Jha's question forward because you can understand. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=138.16s)]
*  The question is about the fact that you've decided to extradite Tahir Varana. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=143.2s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  India has been waiting to have him back in India to bring him to justice. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=151.39999999999998s)]
*  But there are many other elements in the United States of America, particularly Khalistani separatists who've been working against Indian interests. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=157.2s)]
*  How is the United States of America going to cooperate on that front with India? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=166.12s)]
*  There are there have been allegations that have been leveled against Indian agencies by the Biden administration. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=171.08s)]
*  Are you going to relook that with Tulsi Gabbard as DNI now? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=177.56s)]
*  Well, I don't think India had a very good relationship with the Biden administration. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=181.96s)]
*  Biden, they wouldn't sell them oil and gas, which is rather hard to believe because, you know, it's a good thing to do. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=185.8s)]
*  And a lot of things happened that weren't very appropriate, I thought, between India and the administration, the Biden administration. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=192.88000000000002s)]
*  But as you said, we're giving a very violent man, it seems to me. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=199.4s)]
*  I mean, I don't know that he's been convicted yet or will be. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  But let's assume he's a pretty violent person. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=208.08s)]
*  We're giving him back to India immediately. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=211.4s)]
*  And there are more to follow because we have quite a few requests. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=214.12s)]
*  So we work with India on crime and we want to make it good for India. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=218.6s)]
*  And it's very important. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=222.8s)]
*  So that kind of a relationship is very important to us. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=224.12s)]
*  OK, go ahead, please. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=227.32s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=234.4s)]
*  You've repeatedly called India a big abuser of trade and said it is really difficult to do business in India because of tariffs. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  You announced reciprocal tariffs today. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=244.28s)]
*  I'm hoping you can speak about what kind of reciprocal tariffs India can expect. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=246.84s)]
*  Are you willing to make any concessions? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=252.2s)]
*  And how can India head off these tariffs? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=254.83999999999997s)]
*  I also have one for the prime minister. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=257.32s)]
*  Well, it has been to us just about the highest tariffed nation anywhere in the world. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  They've been very strong on tariffs. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=267.12s)]
*  And I don't blame them necessarily, but it's a different way of doing business. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  It's very hard to sell into India because they have trade barriers, very strong tariffs. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=272.24s)]
*  We are right now a reciprocal nation. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=278.8s)]
*  We are going to if it's India or if it's somebody else with low tariffs, we're going to have the same. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=281.84s)]
*  We're going to have whatever India charges, we're charging them whatever another country charges, we're charging them. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=287.44s)]
*  So it's called reciprocal, which I think is a very fair way. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=292.28s)]
*  We didn't have that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=296.4s)]
*  We I was going to do that in my other term. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=297.23999999999995s)]
*  And we had the greatest economy ever in the world. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=300.35999999999996s)]
*  We've never there's never been an economy like we had. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  And then we got hit with covid. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=305.76s)]
*  We had to focus on that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  And I wasn't really in the mood to be putting it on Italy and Spain and France and India, frankly, and a lot of other countries, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=308.64000000000004s)]
*  because the world was very troubled until we got rid of that nightmare. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=316.72s)]
*  But we had the strongest economy anywhere in the world during that fairly long period of time during my first term, as you know. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  And we didn't do the tariffs. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=327.88s)]
*  We would have done the reciprocal tariffs. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=331.08000000000004s)]
*  But we decided and I decided, I think, on a human basis, on a humane basis, not to do them because of the fact that there was such suffering all over the world. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=333.44s)]
*  The last thing we needed to talk about is trade problems. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=342.79999999999995s)]
*  But now we do we're doing we see a tremendous future for our country. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  But we felt that now it's finally time after 45 or 50 years of abuse that we will do. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=351.52s)]
*  And this isn't India. This is among a lot of nations. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=357.64s)]
*  The European Union is very difficult for us. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=361.48s)]
*  Very, very difficult. They they tax our companies at levels that nobody's ever seen before. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=364.48s)]
*  They take advantage of a lot of things. So we're not happy about that. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=370.04s)]
*  China, of course, is terrible. And we've never taken in ten cents until I was president. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=373.24s)]
*  We've taken in hundreds of billions of dollars from China since I've been president in first term and and now. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=378.48s)]
*  And we have to do that just as a mechanism of fairness. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  And that's what I've done. And so we are being reciprocal with India, whatever India charges, we charge them. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=389.4s)]
*  So, frankly, it no longer matters to us that much what they charge, because whatever they charge. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=396.59999999999997s)]
*  I had discussions with India in the first term about the fact that their tariffs were very high and I was unable to get a concession. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=402.79999999999995s)]
*  So we're just going to do it the easy way. We're just going to say whatever you charge, we charge. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=412.0s)]
*  And I think that's fair for the people of the United States. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=416.2s)]
*  And I think it's actually fair for India. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=419.16s)]
*  Please. Ask to the prime minister, please. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=426.96000000000004s)]
*  Ask to the prime minister, please. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=431.96000000000004s)]
*  Yes. Sorry. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=433.36s)]
*  Yoshita Singh with Press Trust of India Prime Minister. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=434.96000000000004s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. Prime Minister. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=437.56s)]
*  The U.S. is giving a lot of push to curb illegal immigration and India has been cooperating on this issue. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=439.36s)]
*  How does India see this issue in the larger context? Thank you. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=447.56s)]
*  I don't think this is a question that is about India only, but even globally you can talk about this issue. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=455.56s)]
*  And we are of the opinion that anybody who enters another country illegally, they have absolutely no right to be in that country. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=462.56s)]
*  And as far as India and the U.S. is concerned, we have always been of the same opinion. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=483.16s)]
*  And that is that any verified Indian who is in the U.S. illegally, we are fully prepared to take them back to India. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=489.96000000000004s)]
*  However, it doesn't stop there. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=506.96000000000004s)]
*  These are children of very ordinary families and they are lured by big dreams and big promises. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=510.16s)]
*  A lot of them are brought in without them knowing about why they are going to a country. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=521.1600000000001s)]
*  And in fact, they are connected with a human trafficking system. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=529.1600000000001s)]
*  And we have to make sure that we fight against this system. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=534.36s)]
*  As far as the U.S. and India is concerned, I think what we should do is make efforts to make sure that we uproot these from within the system [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=537.76s)]
*  so that we can reduce or remove human trafficking. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=549.76s)]
*  And basically the young, vulnerable, poor people of India are fooled into coming over as illegal immigrants. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=554.76s)]
*  And our bigger fight actually is against this ecosystem or this system that encourages such gangs to thrive. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=563.76s)]
*  And I can tell you that India will completely support your endeavor in achieving this. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=571.76s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=577.76s)]
*  The question from Prime Minister Modi first, if I may. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=580.76s)]
*  I wanted to ask you, did you discuss any possible business deals with Elon Musk during your meetings today, Mr. Prime Minister? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=583.76s)]
*  Mr. President, I wanted to ask you, today you spoke about hoping to have three-way talks with President Xi and President Putin. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=591.76s)]
*  What would you say to European leaders and other allies who may be concerned that you're apparently more keen to speak to America's adversaries than to its allies? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=601.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=611.76s)]
*  Maybe I'll just go first on this one. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=612.76s)]
*  We had some talks and we told the European Union, we told the NATO people largely they overlap. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=616.76s)]
*  You have to pay more money because it's unfair what we're doing. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=627.76s)]
*  We're doing a tremendous amount more, probably $200 billion more going into Ukraine, using for Ukraine to fight. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=631.76s)]
*  And Europe has not really carried its weight in terms of the money. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=642.76s)]
*  It's not equitable. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=646.76s)]
*  And we want to see a counterbalance. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=648.76s)]
*  We want to have them put up more money. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=650.76s)]
*  They have to do that. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=652.76s)]
*  At the same time, we had a very good conversation with President Putin the other day, yesterday. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=653.76s)]
*  And we also had a very good conversation. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=658.76s)]
*  I did both in both cases with President Zelensky. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=660.76s)]
*  And I think we're going to be able to do something. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=664.76s)]
*  I think we're going to be able to make a deal. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=667.76s)]
*  And I hope so because it's a horrible war. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=669.76s)]
*  It's a very terrible, bloody war with a million and a half soldiers, at least already dead on the battlefield, lying all over the fields like nobody's ever seen anything like it, certainly since the Second World War. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=671.76s)]
*  And so I think we're going to be able to do something. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=683.76s)]
*  We're working with President Zelensky and with President Putin. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=686.76s)]
*  And my impression is that they I know that President Zelensky wants to make a deal. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=691.76s)]
*  And I also feel that I know that President Putin wants to make a deal. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=696.76s)]
*  I wanted to know that before I began any detailed discussions. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=700.76s)]
*  But the meeting and the conversation also the meeting with Steve Witkoff in Moscow was a very successful one. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=704.76s)]
*  And my phone call with him was a very successful one. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=712.76s)]
*  Please. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=715.76s)]
*  You asked a question regarding Elon Musk. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=722.76s)]
*  I have known him for a very long time. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=726.76s)]
*  I was not even a prime minister at the time when I first met him. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=728.76s)]
*  I was chief minister. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=733.76s)]
*  And today he came to meet me along with all his family, with his children. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=734.76s)]
*  And so we had a nice discussion. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=739.76s)]
*  As far as the EV is concerned, EVs are concerned. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=743.76s)]
*  The EV, the word EV has a copyright. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=750.76s)]
*  And that is one person who has a copyright for the word EV. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=755.76s)]
*  And that is Trump. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=759.76s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=769.76s)]
*  Can I ask whether you discussed at all today the case of Gautam Adani, who's one of the wealthiest men in Asia and perceived as an ally of Prime Minister Modi? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=771.76s)]
*  Prime Minister Modi, have you asked the President to take action on that case? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=779.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=784.76s)]
*  Firstly, India is a democratic country. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=788.76s)]
*  And our culture and our thought philosophy is, which basically means that the entire world is a family. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=794.76s)]
*  Every Indian is my own family member. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=804.76s)]
*  And when it comes to such personal matters, leaders of two countries will not get together on that topic and discuss anything on an individual matter. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=807.76s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=818.76s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=820.76s)]
*  Sir, go ahead, please. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=822.76s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=826.76s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=828.76s)]
*  I have a question for you as well. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=829.76s)]
*  But, Mr. President, you have suggested with regards to the Russia-Ukraine war, you've suggested several things that Ukraine should give up. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=831.76s)]
*  The idea of NATO membership, territory that was seized back in 2014 by Russia. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=839.76s)]
*  What should Russia give up? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=844.76s)]
*  Russia has gotten themselves into something that I think they wish they didn't. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=846.76s)]
*  If I were president, it would not have happened. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=852.76s)]
*  Absolutely would not have happened. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=855.76s)]
*  And it didn't happen for four years. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=857.76s)]
*  If you look at what has taken place under President Bush, they lost a lot. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=859.76s)]
*  Under President Obama, they lost Crimea. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=865.76s)]
*  Under Biden, it looks like they could lose the whole thing. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=870.76s)]
*  Under Trump, they lost nothing. Ukraine lost nothing. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=873.76s)]
*  They didn't give up anything. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=876.76s)]
*  And you take a look at the other three presidents surrounding me, they gave up a lot. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=878.76s)]
*  I think that when you look at Ukraine and when you look at the mess that they're in, it's got to be ended and it's got to be stopped. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=886.76s)]
*  Now, Russia has taken over a pretty big chunk of territory. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=894.76s)]
*  And they also have said from day one, long before President Putin, they've said they cannot have Ukraine be a NATO. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=899.76s)]
*  They said that very strongly. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=907.76s)]
*  I actually think that that was the thing that caused the start of the war. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=909.76s)]
*  Biden said it and Zelensky said it. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=913.76s)]
*  And I think that was one of the reasons, one of the starts of the war. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=917.76s)]
*  But from long before Putin, they said you cannot have Ukraine going in in any way into NATO. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=921.76s)]
*  And I start from that standpoint. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=930.76s)]
*  I think everybody knew that. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=933.76s)]
*  Now, if a better deal can be negotiated, if they're able to make a deal where they can do that, that's fine with me. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=934.76s)]
*  I really don't care. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=941.76s)]
*  I want that bloodshed to stop. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=942.76s)]
*  I don't want to see, you know, we have an ocean between us and the site we're talking about, the site of death. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=946.76s)]
*  We're calling it the fields of death. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=953.76s)]
*  We have a big ocean in between us. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=955.76s)]
*  This is more important for Europe. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=957.76s)]
*  We shouldn't be in. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=959.76s)]
*  They have to equalize, and they're going to have to do it fast, but they have to equalize. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=960.76s)]
*  But as far as the negotiation, it's too early to say what's going to happen. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=964.76s)]
*  Maybe Russia will give up a lot. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=969.76s)]
*  Maybe they won't. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=971.76s)]
*  And it's all dependent on what is going to happen. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=972.76s)]
*  The negotiation really hasn't started. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=975.76s)]
*  But I will say, as far as NATO is concerned, from many years before President Putin, I will tell you that I've heard that Russia would never accept that. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=977.76s)]
*  And I think Ukraine knew that because Ukraine wasn't in and never requested to be in until more recently. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=986.76s)]
*  So that's the way it is. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=992.76s)]
*  And I think that's the way it's going to have to be. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=993.76s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=998.76s)]
*  All right, go ahead, please, with the tie. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=999.76s)]
*  With the tie, yeah. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1001.76s)]
*  Yes, go ahead. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1002.76s)]
*  This is Saurabh Shukla from News Warbill. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1005.76s)]
*  Mr. President, you spoke about Prime Minister Modi as a tough negotiator. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1007.76s)]
*  Who was a tougher negotiator today and who has a better negotiating tactic when it comes to tariffs? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1011.76s)]
*  Oh, he's a much tougher negotiator than me, and he's a much better negotiator than me. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1017.76s)]
*  There's not even a contest. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1021.76s)]
*  Okay? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1023.76s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead, please. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1029.76s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1031.76s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1032.76s)]
*  Reena Bhardwaj from ANI. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1033.76s)]
*  How do you see this relationship between India and the United States to counter China? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1035.76s)]
*  And what is your vision when it comes to India, you know, brokering peace in the Ukraine and Russia conflict? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1041.76s)]
*  Well, I think we're going to have a very good relationship with China. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1050.76s)]
*  I got along with President Xi very well until COVID. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1053.76s)]
*  That was a bridge too far. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1055.76s)]
*  But until then, I got along with President Xi very, very well. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1057.76s)]
*  We were very close as leaders go. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1060.76s)]
*  I don't want to be naive, but as leaders go, I think we were very close. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1063.76s)]
*  And I think that China is a very important player in the world. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1068.76s)]
*  I think they can help us get this war over with Ukraine and Russia. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1072.76s)]
*  And I look at India, I do see the skirmishes on the border, which are quite vicious, and I guess they continue to go on. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1076.76s)]
*  If I could be of help, I'd love to help because that should be stopped. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1085.76s)]
*  That's been going on for a long time. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1088.76s)]
*  And it's quite violent. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1090.76s)]
*  It's quite violent. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1092.76s)]
*  But I would hope that China and India and Russia and U.S. and all of us can get along. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1093.76s)]
*  It's very important. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1101.76s)]
*  You know, the power of weaponry today is, and not only nuclear, but nuclear in particular, the power of weaponry is very important. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1102.76s)]
*  I said before that I had very constructive talks in my first term with President Putin about the denuclearization of the two countries. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1110.76s)]
*  And then we were going to go to China after we worked some kind of a deal. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1121.76s)]
*  And we had the confines of a deal. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1125.76s)]
*  We were, I thought, he really wanted to do it, so did I, denuclearize. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1127.76s)]
*  And it's such a beautiful term when you think about it. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1132.76s)]
*  In other words, to bring it down because the power of those weapons is too great. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1136.76s)]
*  And I did speak to President Xi about that, and I was getting also a very good response. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1141.76s)]
*  He's building a very strong nuclear power. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1146.76s)]
*  He's not very close to Russia or the United States right now, but he will be soon. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1150.76s)]
*  I mean, he'll catch up over the period of four or five years, they say. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1155.76s)]
*  But it would be a great thing if we could, on a military basis. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1159.76s)]
*  We're going to spend this year $900, let's say $915 billion on military. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1163.76s)]
*  Russia, without the war, was spending close to $100, but with the war, I can't tell you what they're spending, but they're spending a lot. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1170.76s)]
*  And China is spending $400 and $450 billion. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1176.76s)]
*  We're over $900 billion. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1180.76s)]
*  And I said, you know, it doesn't really make sense, does it? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1182.76s)]
*  We're spending the money against each other, and we could spend that money for better purpose if we got along. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1185.76s)]
*  And I'll tell you, I think that something like that will happen. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1192.76s)]
*  First, when I left, as you know, four years ago, we didn't have Israel and the Middle East. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1196.76s)]
*  We didn't have October 7th, a disaster, the disaster. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1202.76s)]
*  Nothing was happening. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1207.76s)]
*  Iran was not going to do anything because Iran did not have much money at that point. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1208.76s)]
*  They were broke. They were totally broke. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1213.76s)]
*  They didn't have money for Hamas or for Hezbollah. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1215.76s)]
*  And you didn't have Russia with Ukraine, and that would never have happened. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1218.76s)]
*  But now I come back and I have the whole world is on fire. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1222.76s)]
*  So I have to put out the fires. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1225.76s)]
*  But after I put out the fires, I'm going to meet with China and I'm going to meet with Russia. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1227.76s)]
*  And we're going to see if we can de-escalate, if we can bring it down military, especially as it pertains to nuclear. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1231.76s)]
*  Please. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1237.76s)]
*  Mike, please. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1248.76s)]
*  Prime Minister, how do you see India's role? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1255.76s)]
*  You have had discussions with President Trump about de-escalating the conflict in Russia and Ukraine. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1260.76s)]
*  As you know, I have been in constant contact with both Russia and Ukraine. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1269.76s)]
*  I have also visited both countries. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1278.76s)]
*  And many people are mistaken and they feel that India is neutral. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1282.76s)]
*  I would like to clarify, India is not neutral. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1288.76s)]
*  We have taken a side and we have taken the side of peace. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1292.76s)]
*  And it is based on this principle of ours that in the presence of President Putin, I clearly said in front of the media that this is not the era of war. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1298.76s)]
*  And even today, it is my conviction that solutions cannot be found on the battlefield. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1316.76s)]
*  Ultimately, you have to come to the negotiating table. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1324.76s)]
*  And India has constantly made efforts that there are talks that take place where both parties are present. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1329.76s)]
*  It is only then that we will find a solution. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1338.76s)]
*  The efforts being made by President Trump, I support them. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1342.76s)]
*  I welcome them. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1348.76s)]
*  And I would like that President Trump is successful as soon as possible so that the world is on the path to peace once again. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1350.76s)]
*  Everybody, thank you very much. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1361.76s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1363.76s)]
*  We've been listening to President Trump speak alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1364.76s)]
*  They just took questions and the pair talked about bolstering their relationship and working together to strengthen military cooperation. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1368.76s)]
*  President Trump addressed reciprocal tariffs and trade negotiations with India, reiterating that the U.S. would match tariffs imposed by other nations. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1374.76s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1383.76s)]
*  Major, the president saying he had discussions with India in his first term that their tariffs were too high. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1386.76s)]
*  They do charge average of 12 percent tariffs, which is one of the high among the highest countries, according to one of our sources, that he wasn't able to get a concession from India in his first term and said, we'll do it the easy way and say whatever you charge, we charge. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1392.76s)]
*  But notably, we didn't get Modi's perspective on that. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1406.76s)]
*  No, we didn't. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1410.76s)]
*  Most foreign leaders in these conversations with President Trump understand that the threat of tariffs is something that is negotiable across all goods imported into the United States. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1411.76s)]
*  The average Indian tariff is about nine and a half percent. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1421.76s)]
*  It aggregates out to 12 percent in some, but across the average is about nine and a half. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1424.76s)]
*  U.S. tariffs about three percent. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1428.76s)]
*  If you equalize that, that would mean either the Indian tariffs have to come down or U.S. ones would go up. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1430.76s)]
*  This is all subject to negotiation. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1435.76s)]
*  And one of the things that they're negotiating about is arms purchases from the United States. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1438.76s)]
*  India is one of the largest consumers of military machinery in the world. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1443.76s)]
*  Its largest supplier currently, Russia. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1448.76s)]
*  Sixty two percent of India's military imports come from Russia. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1450.76s)]
*  The United States would like to eat into that Russian supply of military equipment that goes into India. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1454.76s)]
*  And there are conversations going on right now on a joint combat vehicle and a joint aircraft to be made by the United States with India. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1460.76s)]
*  That's one of the things this administration is trying to negotiate with India. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1469.76s)]
*  And the threat of tariffs is part of the leverage of that conversation. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1473.76s)]
*  We know that Modi met with Elon Musk and he was asked whether he made any business deals. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1477.76s)]
*  We didn't really get clarity on that, other than Modi saying that he's known him for a long time and that Trump has a copyright on EVs. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1481.76s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not sure about the whole copyright on EV things, but it is worth pointing out that Tesla is losing a bit of market share. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1487.76s)]
*  One of its biggest competitors and rivals is EVs manufactured in China. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1496.76s)]
*  And Elon Musk would very much like Tesla to get into the Indian EV market. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1502.76s)]
*  That I'm sure was part of the conversation, but the Indian prime minister was nothing if not opaque on the specifics. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1506.76s)]
*  What else did you take away from that, Major? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1512.76s)]
*  So, the Indian prime minister said it is perceived that India is neutral in the war between Russia and Ukraine, where Russia was the aggressor. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1514.76s)]
*  Well, why does that perception exist? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1524.76s)]
*  Because when that war began, when Russia invaded Ukraine, India, the world's largest democracy, had nothing to say about it. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1526.76s)]
*  Did maintain for months and months and months a position of neutrality, not saying that Russia had done what everyone else had fairly concluded that it had done. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1533.76s)]
*  Imposed itself upon the sovereignty of a democratic country, Ukraine. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1544.76s)]
*  India did not weigh in on that at all, much to the consternation of the Biden administration and many in Congress, Republicans and Democrats. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1549.76s)]
*  Now the prime minister says, well, we're for peace, but on what terms? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1556.76s)]
*  And when you listen to President Trump talking about President Putin in Russia, about China, which has allied with Russia in its war against Ukraine, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1560.76s)]
*  and India saying, well, we just want peace, but never really saying that Russia was the snarling aggressor in that war. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1567.76s)]
*  You have to feel, as many Europeans do, and the Ukrainians fear, that the contours of a future negotiated settlement might not represent Ukraine's interests as strongly as certainly President Zelensky would like or the Ukrainian people would like. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1574.76s)]
*  Major Garrett setting the record straight. Thank you. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1587.76s)]
*  Sure. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_mwxCkQ5Fw&t=1589.76s)]
