# How lawmakers are reacting to the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal
**CBS News:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo)
*  Meanwhile, Florida Senator Marco Rubio is testifying today before the Senate Foreign [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=0.0s)]
*  Relations Committee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=4.08s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, he is Donald Trump's pick for Secretary of State. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=5.28s)]
*  And as the news broke of that ceasefire deal in Gaza, the committee took a moment to acknowledge [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=8.88s)]
*  that accomplishment. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=14.56s)]
*  Some breaking news playing out right there during the hearing. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=15.64s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  There's been a ceasefire announced in Gaza before we all celebrate, though. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, we're all going to want to see how that executes. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=23.92s)]
*  All involved deserve credit for the ceasefire that the Chairman's just announced. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=27.64s)]
*  But Steve Woodcock's been a critical component of it, and he has been involved in it from [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=32.04s)]
*  day one. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=35.36s)]
*  I think the broader consideration about whether we want to see a Saudi-Israeli mutual recognition [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=36.36s)]
*  and relationship would be one of the most historic developments in the history of the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=43.4s)]
*  region for all the factors we've discussed here today. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  It would be, and one of the impediments to it has been this conflict and the ongoing [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=50.32s)]
*  conflict and the lack of a ceasefire. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  I also think it's going to be important for the Saudis and others to be participants in [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=56.52s)]
*  post-conflict stabilization efforts in Gaza and beyond. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=61.2s)]
*  So let's go live to CBS News political reporter Torian Small on Capitol Hill. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=64.72s)]
*  Torian, you are just a stone's throw away from where that news broke there on Capitol [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  Hill. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=72.76s)]
*  And you heard Marco Rubio talk about what could happen after, the next chapters and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=73.76s)]
*  involving the Saudis to help maybe build a bridge to a more peaceful future there in [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=83.64s)]
*  Yeah, Reid, a lot of real-time reaction from the Hill, especially during that hearing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=85.64s)]
*  Just an hour before that news broke in the committee hearing, there were protesters in [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=90.8s)]
*  there really voicing their concerns about the State Department, but ultimately protesting [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=95.72s)]
*  the war happening in Gaza. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=101.52s)]
*  So it happens to be a coincidence that just an hour later, this news broke after they [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=103.36s)]
*  were escorted out of that hearing. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=107.72s)]
*  So Rubio not just endorsing the Biden administration, but also making mention towards any inroads [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=110.64s)]
*  Donald Trump's influence could have had in this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=118.36s)]
*  We've also seen other Republicans like Senator John Cornyn of Texas come out and say he doesn't [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=120.76s)]
*  believe that it's a coincidence that this is happening now after Donald Trump repeatedly [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=125.4s)]
*  said on the campaign trail that hell would break loose if a hostage deal wasn't completed [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=130.24s)]
*  by the time he takes office. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=137.6s)]
*  As you know, Reid, it's just a few days away. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=139.04s)]
*  So the Trump team, a lot of Republicans on the Hill believing that his influence is a [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  large factor in what we saw happen today. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=148.16s)]
*  Yeah, Torian, we are seeing real-time reaction there on Capitol Hill to Israel and Hamas [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  agreeing to that ceasefire deal and the release of hostages. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  Stay with me because moments ago we heard from Senator Coons reacting to this deal in [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=157.23999999999998s)]
*  the Russell Rotunda basement. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=161.56s)]
*  Our cameras were there, caught these moments. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  Let's go ahead and play those and then we'll talk about it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=165.48s)]
*  I'm encouraged by news that American hostages may well be coming home from Gaza where Hamas [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=167.12s)]
*  has held them since October 7th and that there may be a ceasefire deal until all parties [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=173.16000000000003s)]
*  confirm that this is moving ahead. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=178.8s)]
*  We should not get ahead of ourselves. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=180.72000000000003s)]
*  But President Biden, his special envoy, his national security and foreign policy team [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  have worked tirelessly to get to this point. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=186.96s)]
*  And one of the things I'm encouraged by and actually just discussed in the hearing with [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=189.84s)]
*  Senator Rubio is that the outgoing and incoming administration's special envoys partnered [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  to help achieve this important result. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=200.0s)]
*  What do you make of Pam Bondi's answers today? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  What do you think of what she's saying? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=204.16s)]
*  I was looking... [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=206.44s)]
*  All right, listening to that reaction from Senator Coons there. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=207.44s)]
*  So let's really scaffold off of that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=210.16s)]
*  First of all, he sounded very tentative about that and so many people, especially across [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=213.68s)]
*  the waters, are saying we're holding our breath. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=218.12s)]
*  We hope this plays out in the next, what, 42 days. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  But he also was very clear to punctuate that this was a deal done not only with the Biden [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=223.34s)]
*  administration, but also in partnership with the incoming Trump administration. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=228.74s)]
*  Yeah, and I think what we're seeing across the political spectrum is a range from cautious [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=232.5s)]
*  optimism to skepticism. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=241.06s)]
*  Coons there said that he still wants to pause until we see actually what comes of this deal. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=243.98000000000002s)]
*  But then also we have senators like Cornyn, like I just mentioned, who said he just doesn't [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=249.46s)]
*  trust Hamas. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=253.1s)]
*  The terms of the deal he doesn't believe would necessarily be fulfilled, but he said that [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=254.62s)]
*  this is still something worth celebrating. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=259.9s)]
*  So we're seeing bipartisan really caution as it comes to this deal moving forward. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=262.1s)]
*  But again, this is about both administrations, both the incoming and the current, looking [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=268.86s)]
*  to take some form of stake in why this happened today. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=274.14s)]
*  When we've seen other incremental developments in this war, we've often heard from the White [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=281.46s)]
*  House, so that's expected, likely to happen today. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=286.09999999999997s)]
*  But the Trump campaign also put out quite a few statements saying that this is something [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=289.74s)]
*  worth celebrating because Trump's influence again. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=293.82s)]
*  So this is something that would definitely deal with the legacies of both presidents, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=296.86s)]
*  whether or not that is truly at the heart of this deal is to be seen, but both are looking [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=301.1s)]
*  to take credit for it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=308.26000000000005s)]
*  Well, and very soon post inauguration day, the ball will very much be in Donald Trump's [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=309.26000000000005s)]
*  court. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=314.74s)]
*  Listen, the first few expected to be released this weekend, but the balance of those 33 [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=315.74s)]
*  still yet to be released. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=320.98s)]
*  And if every part of this deal doesn't go through, to your point about some of the skepticism [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=322.06s)]
*  we trust Hamas to keep their part of the deal or not, there are still many hostages that [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=327.88s)]
*  are being held in underground tunnels at this very moment. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=332.4s)]
*  So let's move on to this. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=335.64s)]
*  Just yesterday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, he revealed a plan, sort of speaking [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=336.88s)]
*  to that post-war Gaza that Senator Marco Rubio was talking to and forecasting, uniting it [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=341.32s)]
*  with the West Bank. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=347.28s)]
*  The plan really relies on the upcoming Trump administration to carry that forward. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=348.28s)]
*  Are we getting any sense there on Capitol Hill of how the Trump White House could handle [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=352.88s)]
*  a ceasefire agreement going forward? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=357.24s)]
*  Not necessarily. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=361.71999999999997s)]
*  There was often mentions during the confirmation here from Marco Rubio about the importance [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=362.88s)]
*  of working with the Saudi government to make sure that they are involved, especially in [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=368.8s)]
*  conflict that's mediating any conflict that happens over there. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=374.03999999999996s)]
*  He made it a key part of not just his opening statement, but in many questions that he was [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=378.8s)]
*  asked about it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=383.56s)]
*  So it's likely that they'll target strengthening those ties, the allyship between those two [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=384.72s)]
*  nations to ensure that that's a part of the game plan. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=389.76s)]
*  But a lot of what we've seen Trump in his last administration, but also in the campaign, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=392.92s)]
*  is leading from the bully pulpit. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=397.68s)]
*  He's looked to really telegraph out to the world the strength behind America through [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=399.4s)]
*  often his words. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=407.88s)]
*  He's been kind of more on the aggressive side when it comes to formulations. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=409.12s)]
*  He's often had nicknames for adversaries to the U.S., not so kind nicknames, I should [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=414.76000000000005s)]
*  say. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=419.92s)]
*  But this is Trump's style. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=420.92s)]
*  He likes to take a more aggressive approach, showing instead of soft power, but it's more [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=421.92s)]
*  harder influence through that type of tactics. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=426.76000000000005s)]
*  So much still on the line as we await that deal and the announcement there from that [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=430.44000000000005s)]
*  room in Qatar from Egyptian officials who have been working to try to get a deal broker [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=435.16s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas, U.S. voices in the room as well. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=440.0s)]
*  Torian Small, thank you so much for that conversation. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=443.16s)]
*  It continues here on CBS News 24-7. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=446.16s)]
*  On the other side of a break, stay with us. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mfzlgfkufo&t=449.24s)]
