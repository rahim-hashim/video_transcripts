# World reacts to U.S. resolution on Ukraine-Russia war at United Nations
**CBS News:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA)
*  Three years after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. led the U.N. Security Council to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=0.0s)]
*  call for peace, but without blaming Moscow for starting the war. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=4.96s)]
*  It was one of two U.N. votes where the U.S. and Russia were on the same side. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=9.16s)]
*  The move came after President Trump expressed optimism around bringing the conflict to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=13.94s)]
*  an end while meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House yesterday. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=17.92s)]
*  But this morning, the fighting in Ukraine continues, with Russia launching seven missiles [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  and more than 200 drones in its latest aerial attack overnight. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=27.88s)]
*  Joining us now for more on this from Kyiv, CBS News foreign correspondent MTS Tyab. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=33.32s)]
*  MTS, how is the U.S. decision to side with Russia at the U.N. being received in Ukraine [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  where you are? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, hey, Errol, good to be with you. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  And in a pretty extraordinary moment, it has to be said. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=48.599999999999994s)]
*  And you really only have to look at one of the Ukrainian delegates at the United Nations [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=51.2s)]
*  who quite literally had her head in her hands as that vote or rather that that U.S. move [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=55.919999999999995s)]
*  was made in the U.N. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=63.0s)]
*  And I think it really sums up the feeling here in Ukraine as well when it comes to just [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  this sense of whiplash so many people here are feeling about how just quickly the relationship [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=69.44s)]
*  between these two countries have changed. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=74.84s)]
*  You know, whatever the personal enmity that, you know, Zelensky may have with President [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=77.28s)]
*  Trump, many Ukrainians tell us that they hope that they can overcome that because for [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=82.6s)]
*  them this is an existential crisis and that, again, many of people telling us here they [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=87.44s)]
*  need the U.S. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=92.36s)]
*  Errol. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=93.36s)]
*  You know, it was fascinating to watch U.S. President Trump with French President Emmanuel [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=94.36s)]
*  Macron in the White House discussing things in front of the press and Macron Trump backed [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  this Macron idea of sending European peacekeepers in Ukraine. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=105.72s)]
*  How likely would Russia be in agreeing to that? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=110.32s)]
*  Well, strangely, we've heard signals that Russia may possibly welcome such a thing. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=117.36s)]
*  Now, whether that's true or not, or just the kind of rhetoric we hear coming out of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=121.88s)]
*  Moscow, especially at a time when they want this relationship that's unfolding with President [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=126.44s)]
*  Trump, which clearly has become quite positive to continue. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=131.79999999999998s)]
*  But I think when we look at the Russian strategy throughout this war, it has always been based [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=137.0s)]
*  on one singular thing, which is their belief that the West and indeed Europe will not be [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=141.38s)]
*  able to withstand or outlast Russia's determination to seize Ukraine or at least some Ukrainian [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=146.8s)]
*  territory. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=154.2s)]
*  And so the thought is, is that many believe that Russia is sort of saying what they need [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=155.3s)]
*  to say in this moment, but their long-term goal is try to take as much of Ukraine as [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=159.02s)]
*  they can. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=163.68s)]
*  Errol. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=164.68s)]
*  So, as we mentioned, Russia launched missiles and drones over Ukraine last night in its [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  latest aerial attack. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=170.28s)]
*  We see some rusty, dusty tanks behind you. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=171.96s)]
*  What is the latest on the fighting? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=175.6s)]
*  Yeah, we're here in central Kiev and these tanks have really become a symbol, if you [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=177.88s)]
*  will, of the sacrifice of so many Ukrainians over the past three years. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  These are tanks that were damaged in the fighting. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=188.56s)]
*  And when we hear about these major attacks overnight, these huge drone and missile attacks, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=192.4s)]
*  it's just a reminder for that everyday Ukrainians, this war is ongoing and it is a war that many [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=198.88s)]
*  Ukrainians are paying the ultimate price for. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  Errol. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  Alright, MTSI reporting from Kiev. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0T0Sj34ydA&t=211.16s)]
