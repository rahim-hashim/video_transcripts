# Trump appears to blame Ukraine for Russia's invasion, Zelenskyy responds
**CBS News:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo)
*  President Trump's envoy to Ukraine, Meentime, is in Kiev this morning for talks with President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=0.0s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky about the ongoing war with Russia. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=5.62s)]
*  The meeting comes a day after the U.S. and Russia agreed to begin work on bringing the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=9.0s)]
*  conflict to an end following face-to-face talks here in Saudi Arabia, as you're seeing [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=14.0s)]
*  now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=18.36s)]
*  Missing from these talks, though, were any officials from Ukraine. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=19.36s)]
*  Yesterday, Zelensky said he was surprised his country hadn't been invited to those talks [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=22.56s)]
*  and reiterated a decision about ending the war that cannot be made without Ukraine. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=27.72s)]
*  President Trump said he was disappointed by Zelensky's reaction and appeared to blame [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=34.24s)]
*  Ukraine for the war, even though it was invaded by Russia. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=39.08s)]
*  But today I heard, oh, well, we weren't invited. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=44.0s)]
*  Well, you've been there for three years. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=45.64s)]
*  You should have ended it three years. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=47.16s)]
*  You should have never started it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=48.92s)]
*  You could have made a deal. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=50.16s)]
*  And just a few moments ago this morning, Zelensky is pushing back against President Trump, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=52.3s)]
*  saying he, quote, lives in this disinformation space. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=57.68s)]
*  James Waterhouse with our partners at BBC News is following developments from Kyiv. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=62.48s)]
*  I think Kyiv's worst-case scenario couldn't even picture the past week at the start of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=67.56s)]
*  what is going to be a very difficult peace process for Ukraine. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=72.64s)]
*  Not only has it not been involved in the first round of talks, which solely involved Russia [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=77.26s)]
*  and the US in Saudi Arabia, but we now have Donald Trump increasingly aligning himself [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=82.64s)]
*  with Moscow, where he suggested President Zelensky has an approval rating of just 4%. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=88.32s)]
*  The latest figures suggest it's more like 52%. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=93.72s)]
*  He's echoed that Moscow demand that there need to be elections in Ukraine, when here [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=96.88s)]
*  they have been legally postponed under martial law. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=103.34s)]
*  And there are, of course, practical difficulties with hosting an election. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=108.36s)]
*  How could you do it where there is fighting, breaking out, artillery overhead and occupied [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=111.64s)]
*  territory? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=116.24s)]
*  There would neither be free, fair or safe. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=117.24s)]
*  And then, of course, you have the real stinger that we had from Mar-a-Lago that Ukraine was [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=120.16s)]
*  to blame for the full-scale invasion that Russia started three years ago and continues [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=125.92s)]
*  to wage today. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=131.72s)]
*  The American envoy to Ukraine, Kyiv Kellogg, has arrived by train where he will meet with [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=133.48s)]
*  President Zelensky. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=138.52s)]
*  On arriving, he said, look, I understand the importance of security guarantees for Ukraine, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=140.60000000000002s)]
*  that military presence to stop Russia from invading in the future after any ceasefire [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=145.12s)]
*  is signed. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  But I imagine President Zelensky is going to want to call him up on a couple of points [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  his boss Donald Trump made last night as Ukraine tries to insert itself in any way into these [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  peace negotiations. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  Washington says it will be involved, but Ukraine really is starting on the back foot, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=165.72s)]
*  hardly from a position of strength, when it looks like Russia is having its demands, its [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=170.48s)]
*  goals increasingly met. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=175.32s)]
*  All right, James Waterhouse, thank you for that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_6AbMvipo&t=177.36s)]
