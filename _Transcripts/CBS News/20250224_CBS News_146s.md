# Vatican releases update on Pope Francis' health
**CBS News:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4)
*  All right, take a live look at the Vatican. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=0.0s)]
*  The Vatican City, I should say, where there is growing concern for the health of the Pope. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=2.0s)]
*  Pope Francis remains in the hospital for a tenth day in critical condition. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  The Vatican says blood tests show early kidney failure. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News Papal contributor Delia Gallagher. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  She joins us live from Rome with the very latest. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=19.42s)]
*  Delia, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=21.68s)]
*  We just got an update from the Vatican saying Pope Francis's condition is generally improved. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=23.48s)]
*  That's good news. What more do we know? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=29.48s)]
*  That's right Liz. This is encouraging news, I have to say, especially after this weekend. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=31.48s)]
*  The Vatican says it's slightly improved, meaning he hasn't had any further respiratory crises. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  He has been able to reduce the amount of oxygen flow when he was using the nasal tubes to get some of the oxygen. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  He was on a very high flow. They've been able to reduce that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=57.48s)]
*  And the kidney failure that was concerning yesterday, they say, is not a concern at the moment. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=61.48s)]
*  So in all, it's a picture which is slightly more encouraging, as I said. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=69.47999999999999s)]
*  And of course they added that the Pope worked this afternoon and indeed called the parish, the Catholic Parish in Gaza, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  which is something that he has been doing on a regular basis for the past few months. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=81.47999999999999s)]
*  So that information also gives you a sense that Pope Francis is feeling a bit better. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=86.48s)]
*  So certainly some encouraging news in the last hour, Liz. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=93.48s)]
*  That is encouraging news, Delia. But how are Catholic leaders reacting to the Pope's health crisis? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=97.48s)]
*  Well, mainly at the moment, Liz, what we're seeing is an outpouring of prayer services being led in parishes around the world. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=103.48s)]
*  I have to say, if you can see behind me just here, the Basilica is set up in about two hours. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=112.48s)]
*  All of the cardinals who live in Rome and who work at the Vatican are going to hold a prayer service right out here. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=118.48s)]
*  So certainly, obviously, the response on the part of Catholic leaders when a Pope is in the hospital, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=124.48s)]
*  is prayer and getting everybody together to offer prayers for his health. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=130.48s)]
*  Liz? At the center of it is all about prayer. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=135.48s)]
*  All right, CBS News Vatican contributor Delia Gallagher, live for us from Rome. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=138.48s)]
*  Thank you so much, Delia. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAnRYQLdHP4&t=142.48s)]
