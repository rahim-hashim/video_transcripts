# Why Trump says he may get rid of FEMA
**CBS News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo)
*  to bring in though first CBS News national correspondent Dave Malkoff. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=0.0s)]
*  Dave, can you hear me? Okay, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  yes, I can. And we're standing in the disaster zone right here in Asheville. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=8.4s)]
*  And then what can you tell us about this? The reaction from the folks in [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  North Carolina, you know, the president saying he's going to issue it in [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  executive order to potentially get rid of FEMA. Can you tell us a little bit [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=21.04s)]
*  about what FEMA has been able to do for the people in that state and the people [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=25.04s)]
*  that are still waiting for aid? I mean, how much are people who have lost their [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=29.0s)]
*  homes? How much are they relying on this funding? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=33.4s)]
*  Well, we've heard some people who have had a lot of a lot of success with the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=38.3s)]
*  FEMA buy out program where they buy out the houses that can no longer be built [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=43.52s)]
*  on the area because there's been mudslides or there's been other issues [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=49.36s)]
*  where they can't build a house again. So their house is wiped off the map. But [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=52.92s)]
*  other people are very frustrated with FEMA. We've got some Trump supporters [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=56.64s)]
*  right here. This is Mark and Leslie. And you guys point point to where your [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=60.88s)]
*  house is. We're just up the hill. There's a pink house on the top of the hill, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=65.84s)]
*  and we're right behind that house. So you are very close to this disaster. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=70.94s)]
*  Now you were standing out here, so you didn't hear what President Trump just [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=75.44s)]
*  said seconds ago. But I'll relay it to you. He said that he may be signing an [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=79.4s)]
*  executive order to get rid of FEMA altogether. What do you think about [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=85.38s)]
*  that? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=90.53999999999999s)]
*  You know, that's really difficult to say. I don't have any information about [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=92.42s)]
*  that. I think what I appreciate is him coming and shining a light on North [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=96.3s)]
*  Carolina again. Um, we're still in a disaster area. We still need support, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=102.1s)]
*  whether it's governmental support, whether it's non nonprofits, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=109.02s)]
*  non governmental organizations. We just we just need the support and the help. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=112.98s)]
*  This is around a $60 billion disaster here. Is that something that the state [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=118.06s)]
*  could support? Or is that something the federal government would would need to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=123.66s)]
*  support as well? I personally don't think either of the state or the federal [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=127.5s)]
*  government can afford to support that. That's why we appreciate so much the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=131.14000000000001s)]
*  nonprofits like Samaritan's Purse, the Franklin Graham's organization, um, uh, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=136.1s)]
*  the, uh, the kitchens that have come in the world kitchen, world central kitchen, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=142.02s)]
*  Jose Andres. Yes. And they came in and they took over our favorite barbecue [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=147.06s)]
*  place, Bears Barbecue and served over 100,000 meals from the disaster to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=152.38s)]
*  about two weeks ago when they folded up shop. Anyways, it's that kind of stuff. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=160.82s)]
*  The sweat equity of the community that is making the real difference here. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=166.78s)]
*  Uh, in terms of rebuilding what we have, our federal government's way too much [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=172.02s)]
*  debt they're holding right now and anything they can do to streamline [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=177.42s)]
*  their selves and be more effective with the monies they have. Uh, we would [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=182.38s)]
*  appreciate it, whether it's a state or the federal government. Some people [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=186.74s)]
*  that I've talked to this week and I've been out here all week, um, have said [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=190.5s)]
*  that in some ways since it's been 115 days or more since the hurricane, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=195.26s)]
*  that in so much has happened. We've had a presidential election. We've had [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=202.02s)]
*  terrorist attacks. We've had the fires in California. So much has happened [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=206.34s)]
*  in there. Is it hard to keep a focus on this disaster when so much is going [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=211.98s)]
*  on in the world right now? I think certainly nationally and maybe [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=218.98s)]
*  internationally. That's true. I mean, our hearts are breaking over what's [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=222.34s)]
*  happening in in California with the fires. I think that's why we're talking [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=226.04s)]
*  about, you know, yes, we want outside help. We can't depend on that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=231.3s)]
*  completely. We really need tourists. We need tourists to come back. Please [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  come back to our beautiful community. Um, but we are, we are working together [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=240.42000000000002s)]
*  and, uh, supporting each other will take outside support, of course, as [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=245.54000000000002s)]
*  well. But we can't depend on that. And it's good to note that Western [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=250.70000000000002s)]
*  North Carolina doesn't just look like this. There are places that were [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=254.26000000000002s)]
*  untouched by the hurricane, but but there is an area bigger than Rhode [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=260.22s)]
*  Island that can never be built on again because of the geologic landslide [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=266.38s)]
*  issues. Um, do you think that this is a fundamental change for this area? Are [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=272.18s)]
*  you kind of on a different trajectory from from now? Um, well, I've not lived [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=280.18s)]
*  here through the last two big floods, one going back to 1918, 1960 or 60. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=285.62s)]
*  Yes. And then so I can't speak from experience, but I can tell you that as [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=291.9s)]
*  a community, we've grown stronger. Uh, we've we've gotten out of our houses [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=298.38s)]
*  and met our neighbors and supported them and we've become much closer. And [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=304.22s)]
*  regardless of the landscape, that's all that really matters in terms of having [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=309.78000000000003s)]
*  a happy life is being in community with your friends, your neighbors, your [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=315.3s)]
*  church and supporting each other. And that's that's strengthened through [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=319.3s)]
*  this. It's WNC strong. That's right. That's right. WNC strong. Come visit. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=324.54s)]
*  We do. Yeah, we love tourists. Our community was $25 million less revenue [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=331.7s)]
*  we're talking about Asheville last quarter because of the lack of tourism. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=339.78s)]
*  So to ask this Asheville then to step up with more money to help. We're cutting [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=346.14s)]
*  back staff at our libraries, our parks, our police department, our fire [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=351.65999999999997s)]
*  departments because of the lack of tax revenue. So we need the tourists to come [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=356.46s)]
*  back or fundamentally this area will change. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=361.41999999999996s)]
*  Well, Liz, I think I think they hold the sentiment of western North Carolina [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=366.02s)]
*  here. It is a big disaster that will take a long time to clean up and a [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=371.85999999999996s)]
*  long time to come back because this is so much damage. It's so widespread and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=377.53999999999996s)]
*  it goes all the way up into Tennessee. And they're just hoping that something [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=384.46s)]
*  changes here that something goes forward in bringing this vibrant community [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=389.64s)]
*  back to life. And I think Western North Carolina strong WNC strong. That was [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=394.74s)]
*  heard loud and clear. No question in the spirit of those individuals is [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=401.82s)]
*  just so inspiring in the midst of so much devastation caused by those [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=405.5s)]
*  hurricanes. Dave Malkoff reporting from Asheville. Thank you so much for that. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=409.26s)]
*  Dave. All right, let's go to Olivia Rinaldi. Now I want to talk about the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=413.02s)]
*  politics of all of this Olivia and this breaking news. The president saying [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  that he intends to sign an executive order to address the future of FEMA [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=419.82s)]
*  possibly getting rid of the organization altogether. What can you [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=424.46s)]
*  tell us? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=428.02s)]
*  Quite a bit of news there from President Trump during that press [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=430.79999999999995s)]
*  conference briefing in Asheville, North Carolina saying of FEMA that he may get [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=433.59999999999997s)]
*  rid of it if he determines that's necessary. And at the very least, he's [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=439.06s)]
*  going to be signing an executive order to overhaul and reform it. He called [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=443.2s)]
*  that agency slow and bureaucratic. And if trump officials I've talked to about [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=447.97999999999996s)]
*  this actually means they tell me that they trust the people on the ground in [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=453.22s)]
*  those states that are impacted more than they trust the federal government to [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=457.54s)]
*  help them with disaster relief funds. I just spoke with an administration [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=461.48s)]
*  official who told me that the idea of this is that no longer will they be [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=465.36s)]
*  going to FEMA asking for some of those funds, but rather straight to the White [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=468.90000000000003s)]
*  House telling them what they need. They'll allocate those funds and then [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=473.48s)]
*  ultimately it's up to the states to decide how to disperse those funds, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=477.14000000000004s)]
*  where they put them, how they'll handle some of this disaster relief. You know, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=481.42s)]
*  you heard trump there criticizing really the reaction of FEMA to Hurricane [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=487.1s)]
*  Helene, specifically in North Carolina, saying that this slow process has [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=491.58000000000004s)]
*  really hampered their ability to recover and he wants to essentially change all [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=495.1s)]
*  of that reform this overhaul it and make it a little bit easier for those people [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=499.42s)]
*  on the ground. And Olivia, the president is also scheduled to visit California [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=504.1s)]
*  today, Southern California. He's gonna head to Santa Monica to tour the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=507.96s)]
*  wildfire damage in the Palisades area. But this trip comes as trump continues [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=511.23999999999995s)]
*  to exchange some pretty harsh words with Governor Newsom over those recovery [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=516.68s)]
*  efforts in that area. This is what he had to say about that visit. Let's take [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=521.06s)]
*  a listen. Mr President funding to Los Angeles because of its sanctuary city [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=524.24s)]
*  policy. I want to see two things in Los Angeles voter I. D. So that the people [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=528.56s)]
*  have a chance to vote and I want to see the water be released and come down [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=533.96s)]
*  into Los Angeles and throughout the state. Those are the two things after [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=537.76s)]
*  that. I will be the greatest president that California has ever seen. I want [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=541.94s)]
*  the water to come down and come down to Los Angeles and also go out to all the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=547.64s)]
*  farmland that's barren and dry. Now we want to know that city and fire [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=552.74s)]
*  officials in Los Angeles County have pushed back on the president's claims, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=557.72s)]
*  saying it was technical issues and also the overwhelming demand on fire hydrants [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=561.6800000000001s)]
*  that played into the struggle to fight these fires. Olivia, does the president [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=567.0s)]
*  have the power to withhold emergency funding from California? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=570.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good question. Liz, a lot of FEMA's budget is actually allocated by [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=576.84s)]
*  Congress. So think of it in two senses. There is the operational budget that [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=581.12s)]
*  they have, but there is the disaster relief fund. Now that fund, it's kind of [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=585.2s)]
*  like a checkbook. You know, these disasters happen and then the governors [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=589.44s)]
*  of these states or local officials then reach out to the federal government, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SceGn_RAdMo&t=592.96s)]
