# Mitch McConnell says he  will not seek reelection
**CBS News:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8)
*  Welcome back. Breaking moments ago on Capitol Hill, Republican Senator Mitch McConnell will [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=0.0s)]
*  not seek reelection. This first reported by the Associated Press. McConnell is the longest [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=6.0s)]
*  serving Senate party leader in U.S. history. CBS News congressional correspondent Nicole [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=11.88s)]
*  Killian joining us once again at this hour live on Capitol Hill. And Nicole, this is [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=16.44s)]
*  big news. What do we know? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=21.12s)]
*  Yeah, it is big news, but not necessarily surprising in the sense that, of course, the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=24.64s)]
*  former minority leader announced some time ago that he would not seek another term as [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=29.64s)]
*  leader, but would fulfill the end of his term. And so according to the Associated Press, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  which got a copy of some of the remarks that he is expected to make on the Senate floor [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  in short time, you know, he is still going to hold up that commitment in terms of serving [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=48.6s)]
*  out the end of his term, which ends in 2027. He is expected to say, according to a prepared [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=55.36s)]
*  statement that was given to the AP seven times, my fellow Kentuckians have sent me to the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=61.52s)]
*  Senate. And he goes on to say that every day in between, I have been humbled by the trust [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  they have placed in me to do their business here. And he chose to make this announcement [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=72.84s)]
*  coincidentally on his 83rd birthday, which is today. So certainly there was some thought [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=76.96s)]
*  behind this in terms of the timing. But look, he is the longest serving Senate leader really [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=85.36s)]
*  here and has commanded a lot of power at times, a lot of respected times, but also has been [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  very stern in terms of pushing back more specifically at times against the Trump [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=100.28s)]
*  administration. We're even seeing now in terms of opposing some of his nominees, but he [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=105.08s)]
*  certainly has a very storied history here in the U.S. Senate, has the respect of many of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=111.2s)]
*  his colleagues, but also in recent years has been plagued by a number of health problems. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=117.28s)]
*  As you know, in fact, it was just a couple of weeks ago that he suffered a fall at the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=122.56s)]
*  Capitol. He's been going around in a wheelchair as of late. It's not the first time that he [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=127.56s)]
*  has fallen. Of course, he is a polio survivor. So sometimes that has been a factor in terms of [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=133.92s)]
*  his gait and his walk. But certainly this is a moment that some senators had been expecting. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=140.32s)]
*  But of course, now the former majority leader and minority leader, because he has served in [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=148.56s)]
*  both positions, is making it official in announcing that he will not seek reelection for another [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  term. Yeah, officially official. CBS News congressional correspondent Nicole Killian. Thank you again for your time. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz0lEX_ygO8&t=159.76s)]
