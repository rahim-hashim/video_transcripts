# The legal blowback to Trump's executive orders
**CBS News:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY)
*  Welcome back to CBS News 24 7. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay, so we are watching the legal blowback [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=4.0s)]
*  of President Donald Trump's executive orders [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=6.0s)]
*  and of course the buyout offer made to federal employees. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=7.84s)]
*  So we go into a new week after a federal judge [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=11.4s)]
*  kind of put a foot in the door pausing [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=13.68s)]
*  the president's buyout plans. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Lot to unpack here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=17.16s)]
*  So let's go live to CBS News legal contributor, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Jessica Levinson, my fellow yogi here, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=20.2s)]
*  doing some deep breathing on a Monday [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=22.84s)]
*  to try to break all of this down. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=24.28s)]
*  So we're gonna talk first about the federal buyout [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=25.96s)]
*  and the challenges that Elon Musk is having in the courts [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=29.32s)]
*  to access a lot of personal records [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=32.04s)]
*  and the legality of all of that. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=33.96s)]
*  But first of all, let's kind of break this down. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  The legality of this, you see the executive orders, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=38.24s)]
*  then you see the court challenges. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=40.72s)]
*  Is this just sort of the meal [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  that we're gonna be eating every Monday [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=43.8s)]
*  throughout this entire presidency? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=46.0s)]
*  Well, that depends on how many executive actions [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  the Trump administration wants to take. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=51.2s)]
*  But it's a really important question [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=53.08s)]
*  because I think what we've seen in the past [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=55.04s)]
*  is presidents have maybe pushed the boundaries [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=57.919999999999995s)]
*  of executive authority. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=60.36s)]
*  I mean, we can think of president Biden [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=61.96s)]
*  trying to cancel student loan debt by an executive action. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=64.28s)]
*  The Supreme Court said no. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=67.6s)]
*  We can think about president Obama and DACA and DAPA, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=69.36s)]
*  those programs talking about deportation. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=73.32s)]
*  But we've never seen anything near the depth and breadth [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  of these executive orders. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=82.52s)]
*  They go further in my view [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=83.88s)]
*  than other executive actions have. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=85.76s)]
*  And there just are simply so many more of them. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=87.72s)]
*  So what we're seeing right now [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  is a fairly predictable pattern. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=92.48s)]
*  A part of the federal government takes an action. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  There are very good arguments [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  that that action oversteps what is allowed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=100.28s)]
*  by the constitution and people challenge that action. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=102.72s)]
*  And now federal judges are saying yes, no, and maybe. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  And that's essentially what we're living through [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=110.44s)]
*  at this very moment. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=113.16000000000001s)]
*  And some have said that this is part of the Trump strategy [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  to test what you can do. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=118.44s)]
*  But also a question I have, Jessica, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=120.8s)]
*  is there a strategy relative to the volume? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=122.6s)]
*  Because if you just flood with executive orders and volume, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=125.2s)]
*  is there sort of a strategy [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=128.96s)]
*  to be anticipated here of fatigue? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=130.4s)]
*  Well, absolutely. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=133.28s)]
*  I mean, I don't think that this is an accident. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=134.52s)]
*  I mean, we've both heard this phrase so many times, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=136.96s)]
*  but the flood the zone phrase. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=139.36s)]
*  So I think certainly people who are bringing legal challenges [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=141.72s)]
*  can keep up, but it costs time, it costs resources. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=145.0s)]
*  And for different nonprofits and different individuals [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=149.96s)]
*  and groups who would bring these challenges, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=153.6s)]
*  they're having to pick and choose a little bit. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=155.52s)]
*  Not to mention the fact that, Reed, of course, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=157.68s)]
*  it's difficult for all of us to keep up [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=159.88s)]
*  and to try and educate the public [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=162.48s)]
*  on exactly what is happening [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=164.24s)]
*  because there are just the volume is so intense. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=166.52s)]
*  And I think certainly this is part [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=169.76s)]
*  of a concerted legal strategy, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=171.68s)]
*  potentially of shock and awe. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=173.32s)]
*  And what happens next, of course, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=177.32s)]
*  will be a big question as to whether or not [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=181.2s)]
*  the Trump administration, as JD Vance is potentially floating, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=183.68s)]
*  would ever get to the point where they would ignore [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=188.4s)]
*  a federal order by a federal judge. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=190.72s)]
*  All right, so let's do our due diligence [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=193.56s)]
*  and let's just sort of break these things down [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  to keep the public informed. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=197.2s)]
*  First of all, relative to those court challenges, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  let's talk about the thousands of federal workers [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=200.64s)]
*  that are in limbo today. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=204.16s)]
*  We know that the deadline is about to approach [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=205.0s)]
*  that judge's order and the deadline. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=206.88s)]
*  What are the legal arguments here [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  and do you see any future in a pause? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=210.36s)]
*  There could be a future pause. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  So the legal arguments we have here [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  are that the Trump administration [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=217.4s)]
*  did not go about trying to implement [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=219.44s)]
*  the so-called buyout program the right way. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=221.96s)]
*  That's the Administrative Procedures Act argument. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=225.0s)]
*  Two, that they didn't actually have the power [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=228.72s)]
*  to implement this at all. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=231.08s)]
*  That's the argument that the Office of Personnel Management [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  isn't the right government agency to try and make this offer. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=236.6s)]
*  And then three, the argument is that this buyout [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=240.44s)]
*  actually violates something called the Anti-Deficiency Act, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=243.68s)]
*  which means Congress said, here's money for X purpose. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=246.92s)]
*  And now the Trump administration, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=250.64s)]
*  through the Office of Personnel Management, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=253.2s)]
*  is trying to say, actually, the money that was allocated [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  to these federal workers, it doesn't need to be used [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=258.36s)]
*  for them to actually work. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=260.64s)]
*  So those are the live arguments. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=262.12s)]
*  Could a judge say, I need more time? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=264.03999999999996s)]
*  We're again, pausing the deadline? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=266.76s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=268.44s)]
*  Let's talk about Elon Musk. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=269.35999999999996s)]
*  There are a couple of realities here. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=270.44s)]
*  Number one, the reality is we are starting [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=271.76s)]
*  to see the headlines come up where he's uncovering things [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  like the fact that it costs more to print a penny [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=276.64s)]
*  than it is to actually have a penny, right? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=279.4s)]
*  The value difference is off. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=281.47999999999996s)]
*  And so we're starting to see those headlines [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=283.4s)]
*  of his findings. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=285.08s)]
*  However, at the same time, the reality is [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=286.24s)]
*  that he's operating largely in the dark. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=288.52s)]
*  We don't have a lot of disclosure about even [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=290.28s)]
*  the granular things of who his staff members are, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=292.44s)]
*  what they're doing, what kind of power. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=294.88s)]
*  And in the midst of that illegal challenge [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=296.76s)]
*  that stopped Elon Musk from being able to access [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=298.79999999999995s)]
*  bank records, Social Security numbers [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=301.0s)]
*  of millions of Americans, where do you see [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=303.28s)]
*  that legal battle going today? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=305.32s)]
*  So that battle obviously is continuing. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=308.0s)]
*  I think you laid this out really clearly. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=310.32s)]
*  And the question really is this doge, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=312.52s)]
*  the Department of Government Efficiency. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=315.55999999999995s)]
*  First of all, what exactly is it? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=318.76000000000005s)]
*  It's not a true department in the government. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=320.56s)]
*  It's kind of this new standalone organization or agency [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=324.12s)]
*  that is operating at President Trump's direction. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=329.76000000000005s)]
*  Now, the Secretary of the Treasury has said, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=332.72s)]
*  come look at these documents. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=335.6s)]
*  But I think legally speaking, there are a couple [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=337.20000000000005s)]
*  of questions. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=339.68s)]
*  Is there truly the authorization to look at the amount [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=340.72s)]
*  of information they're looking at? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  Number one. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=346.12s)]
*  Number two, are there any sort of statutes dealing [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=346.96s)]
*  with privacy and confidentiality? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=349.88s)]
*  And three, are there any statutes dealing [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=352.84s)]
*  with particularly sensitive information [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=355.2s)]
*  like even national security information? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=357.35999999999996s)]
*  And so we're really looking at that congressional [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=361.08s)]
*  authorization and then are you looking at things [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=363.35999999999996s)]
*  that you really are not allowed to look at? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=366.44s)]
*  Again, we don't have a great blueprint [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=370.24s)]
*  because we've never seen anything like this before, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  but I think those are the live legal arguments here. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=374.8s)]
*  Right, and you raised the points about privacy [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=377.24s)]
*  and also about the issue of national security. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=380.12s)]
*  We know that President Trump has said in the coming days, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=382.56s)]
*  maybe even in the coming hours, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=385.56s)]
*  Elon Musk is now going to be directed to go [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=387.2s)]
*  into the Department of Education, into the military records. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=389.40000000000003s)]
*  Do you anticipate this week seeing any legal challenges [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=392.72s)]
*  relative to Elon Musk's access where our kids are concerned, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=395.96000000000004s)]
*  our educational system, our military? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=399.12s)]
*  Yes, yes, and yes. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=401.6s)]
*  So every time we have a situation where Elon Musk [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=402.76s)]
*  and Doge are granted access to a new department's information, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  I think we're going to see [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=411.0s)]
*  what will become a pattern play out. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=412.64s)]
*  This is a really important question. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=414.44s)]
*  And the pattern is basically when will the lawsuit come? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=415.8s)]
*  And I think the answer is soon. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=419.28s)]
*  And what will it be based on? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=420.88s)]
*  And it will be based on what looks like a similar flavor [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=422.2s)]
*  to what we just talked about. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=426.44s)]
*  You don't really have the authorization [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=427.56s)]
*  for the access to this information [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=429.32s)]
*  and there are laws that would prevent you [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=432.04s)]
*  from being able to access this information. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=434.36s)]
*  So yes, with every new step, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=437.68s)]
*  with every new action that Doge takes, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=441.2s)]
*  I think that there could be legal challenges. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=444.2s)]
*  And Jessica, I guess tapping into your brilliant legal mind, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=446.76s)]
*  what you're saying here when we really boil it down [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=449.72s)]
*  is it is not as simple as paper straw or plastic straw. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=451.76s)]
*  You said it better than I could. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=456.6s)]
*  Jessica Levinson, thank you so much. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QdgqeB1kY&t=458.52s)]
