# Details on U.S. peace talks with Russia over war in Ukraine
**CBS News:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ)
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in Saudi Arabia today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=0.0s)]
*  He's expected to lead a US delegation in talks with Russian officials [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=3.64s)]
*  in an effort to end the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  The Kremlin has confirmed Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=10.28s)]
*  will attend these talks. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=13.56s)]
*  When asked about concerns that Europe and Ukraine [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=16.12s)]
*  will be left out of the conversation, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=18.76s)]
*  President Trump told reporters Ukraine's president [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=20.48s)]
*  will be part of those talks. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=23.2s)]
*  He also addressed the urgency to get a deal done. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=24.92s)]
*  We're moving along, we're trying to get a peace with Russia and Ukraine [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=29.2s)]
*  and we're working very hard on it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=32.36s)]
*  It's a war that should have never started. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=34.44s)]
*  I think he wants to end it [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=37.4s)]
*  and they want to end it fast. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=40.68s)]
*  Both of them. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=43.44s)]
*  And Zelensky wants to end it too. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=44.28s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News White House reporter [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=47.08s)]
*  Willie James Endman for the latest on this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  We're all wondering what this means. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=51.6s)]
*  So what is the White House saying about any potential progress [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  that they're making toward peace between Russia and Ukraine? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=57.36s)]
*  Hey there. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=62.16s)]
*  Good morning to you, Eryl. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=62.88s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=64.6s)]
*  Well, President Trump is seemingly presenting optimism [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=65.32s)]
*  in terms of striking a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=68.92s)]
*  But that has really made the Europeans and the Ukrainians, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=72.6s)]
*  quite frankly, quite nervous in terms of what the details are [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=75.56s)]
*  in terms of that deal with the Russians. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=81.08s)]
*  Now, we know that Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State and others, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=83.92s)]
*  are traveling to Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=87.2s)]
*  If not, he's probably already touched down there, in fact, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  to meet with Russian leaders there, as you mentioned, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=92.04s)]
*  Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister of the Russian Federation. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=95.44s)]
*  But the Saudis are playing a pivotal role here as well. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=99.2s)]
*  They played a key role in getting American Mark Fogel back to the United States. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=102.08s)]
*  They have also played a pivotal role in Middle East tensions, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=107.68s)]
*  seeking to ease and bring an end [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  about to the war between Hamas and Israel. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=115.36s)]
*  We, of course, know that Qatar played a pivotal role there as well. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=119.52s)]
*  But Saudi Arabia has tried to have its say in terms of how those negotiations should go. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=122.44s)]
*  But the location is one thing and the meetings to come is another. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=128.4s)]
*  President Trump talked about that meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=132.68s)]
*  We don't yet have a date for that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=135.68s)]
*  But Ukrainians say that they will not have any part of a deal that they are not part of. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=137.56s)]
*  They're not part of these conversations. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=143.44s)]
*  They were not invited to this meeting that's happening in Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=145.84s)]
*  But on the other side of things, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=149.56s)]
*  Keith Kellogg, the president's special envoy for the situation in Ukraine, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=151.4s)]
*  that war between Ukraine and Russia, he is set to not only talk with European leaders, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=155.12s)]
*  but he's also set to talk with Ukrainian leaders as well. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=160.0s)]
*  So the White House is trying to present this as a two track conversation, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=162.8s)]
*  a two track system in terms of those conversations between the Ukraine side [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=166.6s)]
*  and the Russian side to end this conflict. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=171.16s)]
*  And Willie James, over the weekend, the president posted to his social media accounts, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=173.52s)]
*  quote, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=177.96s)]
*  I remember how difficult it was during the first term of the Trump presidency [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=183.28s)]
*  to get the White House to explain his tweets and his messages. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=186.68s)]
*  So I asked this question with sympathy. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=189.36s)]
*  Is the White House clarifying what he meant? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  Because there's a wide range of interpretations. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=194.68s)]
*  Yeah, there certainly is. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=199.08s)]
*  And I remember you spent a lot of time here in West Palm Beach as well, Errol, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=200.28s)]
*  so you know very well how it is to try to get those answers from the White House [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=204.04000000000002s)]
*  while the president is spending time here at the winter White House. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=209.88s)]
*  Now, the president didn't necessarily clarify his message there, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=212.8s)]
*  but he did post on True Social and his True Social account later in the day. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  He talked about the 14th Amendment and essentially said that no other country [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=221.36s)]
*  has a situation in terms of people coming here [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=225.24s)]
*  and being able to have their children be American citizens by birthright citizenship, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=227.92s)]
*  which, of course, is guaranteed in the Constitution. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=233.6s)]
*  I'll read part of that because I put it in my piece over the weekend. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=235.72s)]
*  He said, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  And I'll also note that the vice president has really come out [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=243.11999999999998s)]
*  and questioned the role that judges play in terms of pushing back [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  against President Trump's efforts to change the federal workforce, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=252.11999999999998s)]
*  to change the immigration in this nation. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=256.64s)]
*  We know that he's had several executive actions. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=259.08s)]
*  Many of them are tied up in court. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=261.44s)]
*  But this is just, again, one of those cryptic messages [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=263.91999999999996s)]
*  that is coming from the president himself. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=266.44s)]
*  The vice president, though, was much more direct in his tweet [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=268.52s)]
*  that was mentioned last weekend, calling into question the power that judges have [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=271.84s)]
*  to push back against those efforts and those executive actions [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=277.52s)]
*  that President Trump is putting out since he returned to power in the White House. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=281.6s)]
*  Yeah, good context there. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  Willie James Inman, we appreciate your reporting. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=288.28000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=290.36s)]
*  Joining us from West Palm Beach. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aGNJqqrWQ&t=290.8s)]
