# What to expect from NYC Mayor Eric Adams' court hearing
**CBS News:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg)
*  All right, let's talk about what's happening right here in New York City. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=0.0s)]
*  There's going to be a hearing later today where the Justice Department will be asked [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=3.0s)]
*  to explain its decisions to order prosecutors to drop the corruption charges against New [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=6.44s)]
*  York City Mayor Eric Adams. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=10.56s)]
*  The mayor has pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and bribery. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=11.88s)]
*  He did that back in September. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=14.9s)]
*  CBS News political reporter and attorney Katrina Kaufman is in Studio 55 to talk about this [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=16.04s)]
*  with me now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=20.18s)]
*  So, Katrina, how unusual is it to hold a hearing like this, and what authority or discretion [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=21.18s)]
*  does the judge have to intervene? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=27.92s)]
*  So in order to get a case dismissed, the Justice Department does need the leave of the court. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  So they do have to get permission from a judge. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=36.36s)]
*  So that aspect of it is not unusual. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=38.68s)]
*  It's very rare for a judge not to go along with what the government wants to do. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  But, Vlad, this is a very unique situation. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=46.08s)]
*  So the judge really wants to hear from both sides and get a better sense of their arguments [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  behind why he should consider granting this dismissal of the case. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=53.64s)]
*  Something that's interesting is that this is a very new judge to criminal cases, and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  he previously was up against the first Trump administration. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=63.0s)]
*  He argued in the Supreme Court against them before. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=66.4s)]
*  So Kathy Holkwell, the governor of New York, had some emergency meetings this week. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=71.32s)]
*  There's been some pressure on her to remove the mayor. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=76.44s)]
*  Does this sound like that's a politically expedient thing to do because there's an [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=80.28s)]
*  election coming up? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=83.68s)]
*  It's a very complicated and convoluted process to remove a sitting New York City mayor. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=85.68s)]
*  So given that she's probably not going to do that, we're speculating, but there's not [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=91.76s)]
*  any signal that that's going to happen. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=95.48s)]
*  And where Adams is, where he's not going anywhere, he says, and he's ready to do the president's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=97.48s)]
*  bidding, what does that say about the state of play in New York right now? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=102.92s)]
*  Well, I mean, Kathy Holkwell could remove him if she wants to, but also he's being threatened [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=107.36s)]
*  by New York City's comptroller as well, who has said that he might convene an inability [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  committee, which is what's used for that removal process, unless Mayor Adams can present him [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=117.84s)]
*  with a plan of how he can really continue to functionally run the city, given the absolute [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=122.76s)]
*  mayhem that's been going on recently. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=128.2s)]
*  So what could this afternoon look like? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=130.08s)]
*  I mean, what are the two potential scenarios that we're looking at? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, what we're expecting this afternoon is it's very unlikely that the judge is going [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=135.12s)]
*  to rule from the bench. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=138.68s)]
*  It's possible that he'll want further inquiry into this, you know, potentially witnesses, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=140.52s)]
*  because really both sides that are presenting this today are in agreement. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  Eric Adams and the Justice Department have come to an agreement, and the judge is trying [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=149.0s)]
*  to make an assessment of this. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  And the real key here, Vlad, is whether it's in the public interest to allow this indictment [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=155.24s)]
*  and case to be dismissed. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=160.4s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=162.56s)]
*  All right, Katrina Kaufman, always great to have you here in studio and not at the courthouse, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=163.6s)]
*  although I know you're important there, too. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dah7WfGYg&t=168.68s)]
