# What to know about the winter storm that's walloped the South this week
**CBS News:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A)
*  A historic winter storm has shut down travel for millions from Texas to Florida. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=0.0s)]
*  Parts of the South are seeing record snowfall, which is causing dangerous and icy road conditions. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  And two-thirds of the eastern U.S. will be in the grips of frigid cold temperatures through [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=10.32s)]
*  Thursday. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=14.56s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News reporter Katie Weiss, who's tracking the storm from New Orleans. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=15.56s)]
*  Katie, it's Bourbon Street. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=19.72s)]
*  It's covered in snow instead of the other stuff that it's usually covered in. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=22.38s)]
*  Talk to me about how the city is impacted by what's happening right now weather-wise. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=27.599999999999998s)]
*  Vlad, you make a very good point. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=35.4s)]
*  New Orleans is seeing the white stuff covering the ground this morning, a very unusual sight [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=39.68s)]
*  for folks in the Big Easy to wake up to. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=45.92s)]
*  You can see, I mean, really thick layers of ice and snow that are covering the ground. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=48.56s)]
*  I haven't seen anything like it on the Gulf Coast region. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  And we know that yesterday this city saw the most snowfall it's ever seen in the history [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=57.720000000000006s)]
*  of recorded weather here in the Big Easy. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=63.92s)]
*  Pretty impressive. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=66.28s)]
*  At this hour, we know that the city has taken in or brought in 14 snowplows from an Indiana [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=68.0s)]
*  company to come and plow the roads. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=74.28s)]
*  But as you can tell, there's still a lot of progress to be made. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=77.2s)]
*  In fact, I just spoke with a councilman a little bit ago this morning, and he says he's [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=80.16s)]
*  working to advocate to make sure that the neighborhoods here in the city, not just the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=85.4s)]
*  touristy areas, are going to get that snowplow coverage as well. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  Vlad? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=93.28s)]
*  Yeah, on a serious note, I know that people are dealing with a lot. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=94.28s)]
*  And the question, of course, is when you have a situation like this, Katie, in a part of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=97.16s)]
*  the country that is not used to dealing with the storm, for example, schools, what are [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=102.72s)]
*  they doing in the wake of this snowfall? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=108.36s)]
*  Well, for the kids, among all of this, I think they're having a good time enjoying for the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=113.72s)]
*  first time for many children here in New Orleans, their very first snowfall. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=119.32s)]
*  They have been off of school since Monday even. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=124.91999999999999s)]
*  So schools were out proactively before the snow even fell. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=127.91999999999999s)]
*  And we know it was the same thing with flights. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=132.12s)]
*  Even some flights were canceled late Monday evening before there was ever even any snowfall [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=134.4s)]
*  on the ground simply because of the, you know, the big issue that this cold weather and snow [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=140.20000000000002s)]
*  brings to people. People need more time to prepare and get themselves geared up for this big [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=146.72000000000003s)]
*  storm. At this hour, it's hard to find gas. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=151.36s)]
*  It's hard to really find any business open, groceries, things of that nature. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=154.44000000000003s)]
*  So folks are really sheltering in place and trying to do the best they can with the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=159.4s)]
*  resources they have. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=163.6s)]
*  Vlad. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's not just kids enjoying a rare bit of snow. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  I showed earlier on CBS Mornings that even adults who are finding the silver lining in [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  the snowfall, my favorite is this guy sprinkling instead of, you know, here in New York City, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=174.2s)]
*  we sprinkle rock salt on snow. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=178.24s)]
*  He was sprinkling Creole seasoning on his doorstep, which I thought was hilarious. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=180.28s)]
*  Katie Weiss, thank you very much. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=184.84s)]
*  Oh my gosh, that's fantastic. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=187.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's really, really great. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  I gotta love New Orleans. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=190.44s)]
*  Thank you, Katie. Appreciate it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=191.6s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Grant Gilmore with the first look at [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  the national forecast. Hey, Grant. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=197.56s)]
*  Hey, Vlad. Look, this snow is just, you know, it's unprecedented, right? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=200.24s)]
*  I mean, to get snow across the deep south, it was snowing over the Gulf of Mexico [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  yesterday, which is just crazy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=209.72s)]
*  Houston, look at this, picking up three inches snow in Houston, ten inches in Los Angeles, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  New Orleans, Louisiana, and then Mobile, Alabama, picking up around seven and a half [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  inches of snow, this snow all the way up into the Carolinas. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=223.64s)]
*  Absolutely impressive. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=227.04s)]
*  And the Southerners will do what Southerners do and they're going to have a good time [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=229.4s)]
*  with the snow. But you got to be careful with it because this is a lot of snow, even [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=232.4s)]
*  for areas up north. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=235.92s)]
*  That's a lot of snow to get ten inches, nearly a foot of snow in just one day. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=237.6s)]
*  That's a lot of snow. It may take a little while for it all to melt. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=242.36s)]
*  Some of the peak snowfall across the south. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=245.16s)]
*  Look at all these totals. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=247.88s)]
*  Chalmé, Louisiana, eleven and a half inches of snow. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=249.68s)]
*  Vlad, and look, all of this because of the Arctic cold that's in place. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  We'll talk more about that here coming up in just a bit. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=256.64s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=258.36s)]
*  All right, Grant, thank you very much. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50lVR6Z_2A&t=259.2s)]
