# Alarm over Musk's latest demands for federal employees
**CBS News:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q)
*  We want to bring the latest out of Washington. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=0.0s)]
*  The Trump administration is firing 2000 USAID workers [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=2.0s)]
*  and placing thousands more on administrative leave. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  This comes after a judge lifted a block on the president's plan [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=9.8s)]
*  to dissolve agency operations. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=12.84s)]
*  And it applies to direct hires deemed non-essential. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=15.16s)]
*  That's according to an email sent from the office [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=18.28s)]
*  of the administrator and reviewed by CBS News. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=20.48s)]
*  USAID is restarting voluntary agency-funded return travel [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=23.68s)]
*  for impacted employees overseas. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  Meantime, take a look at this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=31.52s)]
*  It's a post on X from Elon Musk saying [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=33.08s)]
*  that federal employees would need to respond to an email [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=35.56s)]
*  outlining what they accomplished last week. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=39.2s)]
*  Anyone who fails to respond, it says, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=41.92s)]
*  will be deemed to have resigned. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=44.04s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News correspondent Natalie Brand [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=46.2s)]
*  following this for us at the White House. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  Natalie, what can you tell us about that email [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=49.84s)]
*  and the kind of varying advice from different departments [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=52.2s)]
*  on how staff should reply to it? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=56.2s)]
*  Good morning, Errol. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=59.68s)]
*  That's what's really interesting about this. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  Employees, federal employees, received this email [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=63.08s)]
*  asking essentially what they accomplished over the past week, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=65.88s)]
*  asking them to list perhaps in bullet points, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=69.52s)]
*  you know, five or so accomplishments. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=72.6s)]
*  But then what we saw is various agency heads [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=74.72s)]
*  giving different advice, telling employees to pause [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=78.72s)]
*  responding to that email. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=82.4s)]
*  That includes President Trump's own newly confirmed [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=84.32s)]
*  FBI director, Kash Patel, who essentially told his employees [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  to not respond, as well as the State Department [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=92.72s)]
*  and the Department of Defense, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=96.36s)]
*  all saying that they have their own internal procedures [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=98.28s)]
*  for review. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  This comes despite President Trump at CPAC over the weekend, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  essentially urging Elon Musk to get even more aggressive [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  with his efforts to reduce federal employees [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=110.68s)]
*  within the workforce. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=114.68s)]
*  Again, telling him, you know, praising the work [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=116.56s)]
*  that he's done so far, telling him to even go further. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=118.76s)]
*  But again, now we are seeing some pushback [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=122.76s)]
*  from agency heads to this latest directive from Elon Musk. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=126.0s)]
*  I also, Errol, want to note a new tweet from Musk [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=131.04s)]
*  this morning. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=134.32s)]
*  This is on a separate topic, that executive order [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=135.24s)]
*  essentially telling employees that they have to return [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=138.28s)]
*  to work in person. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=141.16s)]
*  He said, those who ignored President Trump's [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=142.88s)]
*  executive order to return to work [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=145.28s)]
*  have received over a month's warning. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  Starting this week, those who fail to come to the office [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=149.8s)]
*  will be placed on administrative leave. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=153.52s)]
*  So we don't know what kind of number of employees, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  the pool of employees this might affect, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=159.28s)]
*  but this is again, yet another initiative [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=161.16000000000003s)]
*  by the Department of Government Efficiency [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=164.04000000000002s)]
*  to try to further reduce staffing government-wide. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=166.6s)]
*  And Natalie, it's impacting so many people. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=170.08s)]
*  It's changing their lives. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=172.4s)]
*  People at USAID, for example, you've got the thousands [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=173.72s)]
*  who are fired, more being put on administrative leave. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=176.56s)]
*  They've got, you know, family with them overseas. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=179.24s)]
*  Update us on what's happening to them [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=182.2s)]
*  with this request to bring them back home. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=184.16s)]
*  Yeah, this is another email that went out over the weekend, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=188.84s)]
*  which essentially said that direct hires [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=192.0s)]
*  who are not mission critical, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=196.16s)]
*  we're talking about a pool of around 4,200 employees, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  they will be placed on administrative leave. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=203.28s)]
*  And then an additional 2,000, we've learned, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=206.84s)]
*  will be potentially fired [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=210.0s)]
*  as part of a reduction in force procedure. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  This all comes, Erroll, as you noted, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=215.52s)]
*  remember earlier this month, a federal judge [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=217.28s)]
*  had essentially told the Trump administration [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=220.28s)]
*  that these employees had to be reinstated, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=223.56s)]
*  temporarily blocking the administration's efforts [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=227.4s)]
*  to further reduce USAID. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=231.16s)]
*  Well, late Friday, the judge ruled against extending [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=234.44s)]
*  that temporary stay, allowing the Trump administration [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=238.96s)]
*  to move forward with these efforts. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=242.72s)]
*  And as we've reported, Erroll, the Trump administration, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=244.8s)]
*  there are plans in the works that appears to merge USAID [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  with the State Department [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=252.36s)]
*  and significantly reduce the number of employees and funding. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=253.84s)]
*  All right, Natalie, thank you. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  A lot of updates there from the White House. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW0yQIwVA1Q&t=259.48s)]
