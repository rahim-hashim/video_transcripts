# Breaking down Hegseth's cyber policy against Russia
**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ)
*  A U.S. official tells CBS News that the cyber policy on Russia remains, quote, very much [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=0.0s)]
*  intact. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  That's despite sources telling CBS News that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had paused [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=7.08s)]
*  operations last month. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=11.4s)]
*  The Defense Department says it does not comment on cyber operations. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  CBS News Pentagon reporter Eleanor Watson is following this for us. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=17.44s)]
*  So, Ellie, what do we know about this order? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=20.6s)]
*  Cyber operations are one of the most highly classified parts of the entire U.S. government, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=23.84s)]
*  So it's not a surprise that we don't have a whole lot of clarity here. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=27.92s)]
*  But what we do know is that Secretary Hegseth did issue a directive to Cyber Command, the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=31.680000000000003s)]
*  military command that handles cyber threats, to pause temporarily all offensive operations [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=36.56s)]
*  against Russia. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=43.56s)]
*  This directive doesn't impact other agencies within the government that deal with cyber [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=45.22s)]
*  threats, but just to the cyber command. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=51.0s)]
*  What are offensive actions? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=54.32000000000001s)]
*  Sometimes it can be hard to differentiate between offensive and defensive, but experts [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=56.08s)]
*  have told us that offensive cyber operations could include going after the networks of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=61.16s)]
*  adversaries, playing with their power grids, or conducting a social media information operation. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=67.16s)]
*  But the scope of offensive operations the military keeps really, really under wraps. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=74.8s)]
*  The first time I can remember the Pentagon even acknowledging offensive operations was [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=80.2s)]
*  just a few years ago in 2022 when the head of Cyber Command at the time said the U.S. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=84.96s)]
*  was conducting both defensive and offensive operations to support Ukraine in its war against [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=90.16s)]
*  Russia. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=96.44s)]
*  And Secretary Hegseth has previously said, quote, everything is on the table to end the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=97.94s)]
*  war in Ukraine. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=101.41999999999999s)]
*  Could this be part of negotiations or a strategy to get Russians to the table? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=102.41999999999999s)]
*  Sources say that pauses like this one could be taken at the beginning of sensitive diplomatic [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=107.28s)]
*  talks. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=112.64s)]
*  So the Trump administration is trying to get both Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=114.64s)]
*  table to end the three year war there. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=118.12s)]
*  Now, what we don't know is how or if this does impact Ukraine or other European allies [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=121.0s)]
*  who the Trump administration has been pretty vocal about. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=128.28s)]
*  They should do more about their own military readiness. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=131.64s)]
*  What does this mean for Ukraine's fight when you combine this with the pause in military [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=134.36s)]
*  aid to Ukraine? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=138.56s)]
*  I do want to differentiate between the pause in military aid and this directive, because [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=140.52s)]
*  from what we know about the directive to Cyber Command is it was issued before Friday's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=145.8s)]
*  explosive meeting between Zelensky and Trump. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=151.04s)]
*  And the pause in military aid seems to be a repercussion of that meeting. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=155.52s)]
*  Regardless, if you're Ukraine, neither development is very welcome, because Ukraine is still [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  for more security guarantees from the U.S. before it gets to the negotiating table with [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=167.64s)]
*  Russia. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=172.76s)]
*  Ellie Watson, thank you. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k57Bo5oYtmQ&t=173.76s)]
