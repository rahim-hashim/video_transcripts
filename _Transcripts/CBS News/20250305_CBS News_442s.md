# Why is Trump's tariff pause for automakers important for consumers, economy?
**CBS News:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg)
*  Hello everyone, I'm Major Garen in Washington. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight on America Decides, guess what? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=2.52s)]
*  We have some numbers for you and I think you'll enjoy them. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  50, that's the number of minutes President Trump and Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  spent talking on the phone today about tariffs. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  The President called this conversation quote, constructive. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Next number, 30, that's the number of days the President will delay tariffs on cars and [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=19.92s)]
*  auto parts from Mexico and Canada. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=25.6s)]
*  We'll hear from the head of the provincial government in Ontario, that's in Canada as [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=28.16s)]
*  you might well know, that produces the most auto parts, what he thinks about this particular [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=31.88s)]
*  delay. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=36.84s)]
*  And 100, that's another number. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=37.84s)]
*  That is the length of the President's address to Congress in minutes. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=39.34s)]
*  It was, by that measure, the longest formal address to a joint session of Congress in [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=42.96s)]
*  the modern era. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=48.64s)]
*  And in it, President Trump again sounded very tough and aggressive on tariffs and on his [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=49.64s)]
*  efforts with Elon Musk to shrink the size of the federal workforce. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=56.62s)]
*  I want to start tonight with Olivia Rinaldi and Caitlin Hewley-Burns. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=61.739999999999995s)]
*  Olivia's at the White House, Caitlin is on Capitol Hill. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=64.78s)]
*  Olivia, let me start with you. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=67.06s)]
*  I know you remember this from the President's address last night, but he talked about tariffs [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=68.34s)]
*  at some length. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=72.5s)]
*  Let's play one part of that conversation he had with Congress and the rest of the world. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=73.78s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=77.62s)]
*  Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades and now it's our turn to start [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=80.25999999999999s)]
*  using them against those other countries. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=85.18s)]
*  On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada, have you heard of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=88.38000000000001s)]
*  them? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=96.10000000000001s)]
*  And countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  It's very unfair. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=103.98s)]
*  And yet, Olivia, today there was some reassessment of that and exemptions were imposed to protect [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=106.54s)]
*  certain economic sectors from these tariffs. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=115.1s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=117.66s)]
*  Yeah, there certainly was a change in tone today, Major, here at the White House. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=118.66s)]
*  Caroline Levitt, the White House press secretary, announced that after speaking with the heads [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=122.5s)]
*  of the big three automakers, Stellantis, Ford and General Motors, there will be a one-month [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=126.97999999999999s)]
*  pause on any auto tariffs coming across Mexico and Canada. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=132.5s)]
*  Now, she said this came as a request from those big three. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=136.98s)]
*  They had a conversation with Trump yesterday. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=140.94s)]
*  And as a result, there is a one-month pause on their tariffs. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=143.78s)]
*  And I do want to underscore how important this is because we think of the auto industry [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=149.58s)]
*  and we think of made in America cars, but that's not exactly quite right. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=154.3s)]
*  A lot of these parts are made in Canada and Mexico and they flow freely across the U.S.-Mexico [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=158.3s)]
*  border, U.S.-Canada border, assembled here perhaps and then sold as a made in America [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=164.9s)]
*  car. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=170.58s)]
*  The problem, though, was with these tariffs, these 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=171.58s)]
*  a lot of these trade, a lot of the trade that's happening between these trucks to make these [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=176.66000000000003s)]
*  automobiles, they're going across the border multiple times a day. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=181.3s)]
*  So now you have compounding effects of tariffs were then being passed on to the consumer. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=184.34s)]
*  Some estimates found that gas-powered cars, the cost of them could go up $3,000 under [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=190.78s)]
*  these tariffs. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  Some also found that electric vehicle-powered cars could go up $12,000 under these tariffs. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=198.64s)]
*  Now, that wouldn't be immediate. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=205.04s)]
*  Of course, it would be within the next six to nine months they have to bake in these [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=206.04s)]
*  prices, but it certainly would have been felt by these consumers who would be buying these [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  new cars. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=216.16s)]
*  So there was a carve out today for the auto industry, but I do want to note one last thing [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=217.16s)]
*  that Vice President Vance actually just said when he was at the border and he was asked, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=221.32s)]
*  Look, the auto industry got a carve out on these tariffs. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=226.64s)]
*  What about other industries? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=228.32s)]
*  Is there anyone else you're looking at? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  He just said that there are a number of industries that have also reached out to the White House [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=230.98s)]
*  asking for these exemptions. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=236.44s)]
*  However, Trump doesn't want 500 different industries getting 500 different carve out. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  So businesses are already seeing the impact of, hey, the auto industry was able to get [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=243.88s)]
*  out of this for at least a month. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=247.92s)]
*  What about us? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=249.16s)]
*  So you're starting to see some pushback from businesses specifically on these tariffs. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=250.16s)]
*  Olivia, thank you very much for that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=253.88s)]
*  Kayla, I want to talk to you about what Olivia just summarized, which is this carve out for [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=255.84s)]
*  the auto parts and auto makers because in part the Trump administration knows that the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=259.56s)]
*  USMCA, the trade deal it negotiated in its first term with Canada and Mexico creates [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=265.84s)]
*  protections for these industries and they can bring a claim against this administration [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=272.03999999999996s)]
*  for violating the very treaty that it negotiated. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=278.12s)]
*  Other industries could do the same. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=283.32000000000005s)]
*  Yes, I know the vice president just said, according to Olivia's excellent reporting, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=284.76000000000005s)]
*  that they don't want to have 500 different carve outs, but there's reason for these industries [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  to say, hey, wait a minute. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  You put together a whole roadmap for trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=295.24s)]
*  and you're the one violating your own negotiated trade pact. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=300.48s)]
*  I'm sure that was part of the post address conversation on the Hill today. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=304.56s)]
*  Well, it's interesting, Major, because as Olivia was describing that, I was thinking [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=309.36s)]
*  that there are a lot of lawmakers here on Capitol Hill wanting carve outs as well. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=313.04s)]
*  They're very nervous about what this would look like. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=318.36s)]
*  They are giving the president lots of room and latitude to use their words to make these [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=322.32s)]
*  kinds of deals, hoping that in the long run it's better for their constituents and for [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=329.52s)]
*  American workers. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=335.28s)]
*  But there is no doubt they are worried and they are trying to raise some of these concerns. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=336.48s)]
*  I mean, they're looking at the stock market like everybody else. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=343.20000000000005s)]
*  They're looking at what Olivia just described, these possibilities that could be passed on [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=345.96000000000004s)]
*  to constituents and especially those in heavy manufacturing states, big farming states [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=350.92s)]
*  and others, you know, concerned about their own industries in their states and their [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=356.0s)]
*  constituents as well. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  So they're happy to give the president some room here and they like to say that, look, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=363.08000000000004s)]
*  he's just trying to make a deal. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=369.44s)]
*  This is all, though, been hypothetical for them up until now. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=371.88s)]
*  Over the course of the past several months, they know that Trump has talked about the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=377.16s)]
*  way in which he wants to use tariffs now that he's actually using them. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=381.20000000000005s)]
*  That introduces a new dynamic up here on Capitol Hill. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=385.44s)]
*  And we've seen the president really test his party when it comes to issues like this. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=389.0s)]
*  And Major, I was thinking last night something else that actually caught members off [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=393.96s)]
*  guard is the way in which he said, talked about trying to get rid of the Chips Act, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=398.96s)]
*  a bipartisan piece of legislation passed here on Capitol Hill with the support of 17 [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=404.16s)]
*  Republicans signed by President Biden in a way to increase chips manufacturing here in [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=410.36s)]
*  the U.S. That caught many members off guard and they're seeking clarification on that [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=416.16s)]
*  as well. So the sentiment up here on Capitol Hill is can there be chances for waivers [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=421.96s)]
*  on these sorts of things? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=428.76s)]
*  How far is the president actually going to go and what kind of leverage can they exert? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=430.52s)]
*  Olivia Rinaldi at the White House, Caitlin Huey-Burns on Capitol Hill. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=438.28000000000003s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2ixlMUfLg&t=441.28000000000003s)]
