# Hostages released by Hamas as ceasefire holds; family confirms return of Shiri Bibas' remains
**CBS News:** [February 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM)
*  The Hamas terrorist group began freeing six more Israeli hostages in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=0.0s)]
*  They include three men who were abducted at a music festival during the October 7th terror attack [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=5.72s)]
*  and a father whose wife and two young children were freed in an exchange in 2023. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=11.56s)]
*  The release is happening despite heightened tensions after Hamas handed over a body that was misidentified as Shiri Bebas, a mother of two. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=17.36s)]
*  This morning her family says remains that were returned overnight by a militant group are hers. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=26.759999999999998s)]
*  Deborah Pata is in Jerusalem with the very latest. Deborah, good morning. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=33.2s)]
*  A very good morning. Well, it has certainly been an agonizing week for Israelis after Hamas failed to hand the body of Shiri Bebas over on Thursday, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=39.64s)]
*  but her remains were eventually transferred last night. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=49.72s)]
*  Finally, Shiri Bebas has come home. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=54.76s)]
*  In the early hours of this morning, braving miserable weather, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=59.0s)]
*  mourners lined the streets to pay their respects to the young mother and her two dead children. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=62.92s)]
*  This morning, another six living hostages were released. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=70.72s)]
*  Four more bodies are expected to be handed over this coming week. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=74.88s)]
*  Then that's it. The six week truce ends. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=79.16s)]
*  Talks to extend the ceasefire for a second round have not even officially started yet. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=83.6s)]
*  At stake, Hamas wants Israeli troops to withdraw from Gaza. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=90.24s)]
*  Israel wants the territory demilitarized and Hamas out. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=94.8s)]
*  But look at today, Hamas fighters taking every opportunity to flex their military muscle. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=99.92s)]
*  The families of those still captive in Gaza are insisting negotiations must go ahead. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=107.2s)]
*  Like Yael Alexander, whose son Edan is thought to be the last living American hostage. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=114.48s)]
*  This is the nightmare. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=121.64s)]
*  If suddenly they decided, OK, it's not working, let's stop. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=124.72s)]
*  And that's it. No releases of hostages. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=130.08s)]
*  This will be disaster for us, the families. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  The cry for the ceasefire to hold is echoed across the ruins of Gaza. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=137.28s)]
*  Waheba Mohsen lost her husband and three sons during more than 50 months of war. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=143.56s)]
*  She lives in a tent near what used to be her home. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=151.56s)]
*  We've had enough of war, she told us. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=157.16s)]
*  I've lost so much. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  Like so many here, she yearns only for a lasting peace. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=162.8s)]
*  More than 600 Palestinians jailed in Israel will be freed in exchange for today's hostages, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=170.32000000000002s)]
*  and they include 50 serving life sentences. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  Errol? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=180.96s)]
*  Deborah, thank you for that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=182.28s)]
*  And a programming note for you. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  President Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, will be one of the guests on Face the Nation tomorrow. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=185.32s)]
*  You can catch that right here on CBS. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oVKXi8CIjM&t=191.04s)]
