# Los Angeles firefighters have a critical window to gain control of wildfires
**CBS News:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I)
*  Strong winds in the Los Angeles area have weakened for now, providing firefighters with a critical window to gain control of the ongoing wildfires. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=0.0s)]
*  The National Weather Service says despite the lull, dangerous wind conditions are expected to pick up next week. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=8.0s)]
*  As of Thursday evening, at least 25 people have died in the fires. The flames have burned more than 12,000 structures and 60 square miles. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=14.0s)]
*  For context, that's larger than the entire city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=21.0s)]
*  CBS News reporter Andres Gutierrez joins us now from the Pacific Palisades neighborhood. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=25.0s)]
*  Andres, how much containment progress were emergency crews able to make Thursday with these winds subsiding? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=29.0s)]
*  Well, Lindsay, we are anticipating another update this evening. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=36.0s)]
*  But as of this morning, the Palisades fire has been contained at 22 percent, burning just over 22,000 acres across town. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=39.0s)]
*  The Eaton fire has scorched 14,000 acres and right now containment is at 55 percent. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=48.0s)]
*  They have made significant progress, so much so in the last 24 hours that this afternoon they are letting some of the Pacific Palisades residents that are on the northern and eastern edge of the fire zone back home. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=54.0s)]
*  So they are lifting some of the mandatory evacuation orders. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=66.0s)]
*  They have to show their ID and make it to certain checkpoints. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=70.0s)]
*  But if you are in the heart, ground zero of the fire, it will be a while, at least a week before you can return home. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=73.0s)]
*  They are obviously trying to maintain, keep utilities off. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=81.0s)]
*  They're trying to shut off gas lines. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=86.0s)]
*  They're trying to cut off some downed power lines in case once the power returns, those lines aren't re-energized. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=88.0s)]
*  But besides that, there are also 31 active missing persons cases. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=96.0s)]
*  And so as the utilities are doing their work, there's also the grid search that continues for those missing individuals. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=102.0s)]
*  And there's the grim task of involving cadaver dogs looking for human remains. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=108.0s)]
*  As you said, the death toll remains right now at 25, but can go up. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=113.0s)]
*  31 still missing. Wow. Pasadena is now under a public health emergency as toxic ash and debris from the Eaton fire pose a threat. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=118.0s)]
*  How serious is that warning and how can people protect themselves? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=125.0s)]
*  Well, think about it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=130.0s)]
*  They're not only dealing with the toxins from the brush fire that they dealt here with the wildfire, they're also dealing with the urban fire. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=132.0s)]
*  Think about the furniture, the cars, everything that was inside a house that burned. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=139.0s)]
*  All those chemicals have been released up into the air. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=144.0s)]
*  So the city is taking this warning very seriously because that ash can carry some of that burned material, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=147.0s)]
*  carrying those toxic particles like asbestos and lead that won't necessarily show up in an air quality report. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=153.0s)]
*  So they're asking people to wear their N95 masks, a P100 respirator if possible. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=160.0s)]
*  In fact, the city said this morning that they will be issuing those to residents once they reopen these areas up [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=167.0s)]
*  so people can sift through their debris here wearing those respirators and masks. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=174.0s)]
*  Andres Gutierrez, thank you. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4V7FNrmM6I&t=179.0s)]
