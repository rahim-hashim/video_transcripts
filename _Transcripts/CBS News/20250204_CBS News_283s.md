# Trump, Netanyahu meet as fragile Gaza ceasefire holds
**CBS News:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc)
*  I'm Major Garen in Washington. Tonight on America Decides Middle East Talks, we are waiting to hear from President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=0.0s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu. Both are expected to address reporters this hour at the White House. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=7.54s)]
*  We'll take you to the White House when that happens and this might be more information than you're interested in. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=13.32s)]
*  We have a full show planned for tonight. The White House, according to the schedule [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=17.82s)]
*  we were given this morning, is running at least a half an hour behind schedule. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=21.5s)]
*  We were tracking this at 5 10 Eastern. So at some point in this hour [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=24.62s)]
*  we anticipate that press conference. When it happens, we will take you there. In the meantime, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=28.84s)]
*  we are of course tracking several other big stories right here in the nation's capital. The FBI deadline, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=32.76s)]
*  well, it's been reached as the names of some [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=38.96s)]
*  5,000 employees who worked on January 6th and related cases, those names have been handed over to the Justice Department. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=41.96s)]
*  FBI agents have subsequently filed a lawsuit in response and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=50.0s)]
*  moving forward. Votes along party lines in two separate committees move Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=56.2s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard closer to final Senate confirmation votes. Plus, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=62.88s)]
*  China answers back. Beijing has responded to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports. In return, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  China has said the United States and its exporters will face new taxes as soon as February 10th. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=75.4s)]
*  Let's start tonight with Aaron Navarro at the White House. Aaron, the meeting, as I understand it, between [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=82.48s)]
*  President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has begun. There is lots for those two leaders to talk about. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=88.56s)]
*  Major, that's correct. While he was signing executive orders earlier this afternoon, President Trump said that he is there to just quote, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=97.0s)]
*  listen to what the Israeli Prime Minister has to say. But officials have told CBS News throughout the day that the hostage deal [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=104.24s)]
*  as well as the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas is front of mind, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=111.54s)]
*  especially when it comes to getting to phase two. You have heard Trump in recent days [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=116.38000000000001s)]
*  seem a bit wishy-washy on if he thinks the ceasefire will hold. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=121.7s)]
*  His special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, told reporters that he is called hopeful that it will remain, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=125.58s)]
*  but certainly a lot to work out in that phase two of the ceasefire agreement. Quite separate from the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=131.62s)]
*  phase two part of the ceasefire agreement in which [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=137.58s)]
*  there is a lot yet to be done and there are still hostages yet to be released and a schedule that needs to be followed there. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=141.02s)]
*  President Trump also made some rather stark comments today in the Oval Office about [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=147.9s)]
*  Gaza and the future of those who currently call that home. Let's listen to the president. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=153.02s)]
*  I think they'd love to leave Gaza if they had an option. Right now they don't have an option. What are they gonna do? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  They have to go back to Gaza. But what is Gaza? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=163.56s)]
*  There's practically not a building standing [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=166.18s)]
*  and they're very dangerous. You know those buildings are shifting and they're falling down all over the place and there's gunfire [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=169.22s)]
*  all over. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=177.1s)]
*  It's gonna be that way for a while. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=178.66s)]
*  Aaron, as you well know, this is an issue that will be not only relevant to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=181.38s)]
*  Palestinians in Gaza, the Israeli government, but the governments in Jordan and Egypt. The president implied [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=186.5s)]
*  the Palestinians now in Gaza could and should go to either Jordan or Egypt. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=192.82s)]
*  But as I understand it, both those countries have said no, that's not going to happen. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=197.78s)]
*  And Trump was asked about the rejection of that idea in the Oval Office. He pointed to Venezuela [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=202.94s)]
*  eventually after initially being combative, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=209.66s)]
*  accepting undocumented migrants deported outside of the US. Another striking comment that he made and an idea he suggested is [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=212.57999999999998s)]
*  not only creating [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=220.5s)]
*  one big beautiful land in Gaza, but other places in Jordan and Egypt for [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=222.62s)]
*  Palestinians to go to permanently. Again, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=230.02s)]
*  he has talked a lot about rebuilding Gaza, saying that it's a demolition site, saying that there is [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=232.98000000000002s)]
*  wealth in the area to help build up that land that has been decimated by Israeli strikes. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=238.38s)]
*  But he also seemed to float, potentially Palestinians being moved permanently to other countries, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=244.5s)]
*  which as you mentioned, we have not heard those leaders say they would accept that kind of movement. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=249.34s)]
*  But briefly Aaron, some members of Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government have talked about that, and it sounds as if the president is [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=254.70000000000002s)]
*  leaning in their direction. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=262.62s)]
*  Yeah, and his special envoy Steve Witkoff, when asked about this idea of [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=264.90000000000003s)]
*  moving Gazans out while they rebuild the land, said that they will be leaning on Israel throughout this process. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=270.74s)]
*  So certainly a lot of things to watch in the next couple weeks. Aaron Navarro in the White House, Slawn for us. Thank you very much. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZQij6i9tc&t=277.54s)]
