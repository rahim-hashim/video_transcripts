# Trump speaks after touring wildfire damage in Los Angeles
**CBS News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ)
*  We want to take you now to Los Angeles County, where President Trump is speaking at a briefing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=0.0s)]
*  with officials after touring wildfire damage. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=10.0s)]
*  It's incredible, actually, when you see some things like that. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=12.52s)]
*  We just left North Carolina and we had just a similar type of disaster. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=14.92s)]
*  It was water instead of fire. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=21.46s)]
*  But boy, that water did damage like I've never seen before. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=23.0s)]
*  And then you come here and you see this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=27.18s)]
*  But the people are so amazing and your fire department was so beautiful. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=30.02s)]
*  Every one of them is in perfect physical shape. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=34.86s)]
*  I said, what do you guys do? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=36.82s)]
*  They have very high standards, I could tell you. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=38.1s)]
*  And we took pictures with all of them, but very nicely they gave us a little helmet. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=41.1s)]
*  And I said, you really, you wear this, huh? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=47.9s)]
*  Is this real? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=50.18s)]
*  And they said, yeah. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=51.18s)]
*  I said, it's awfully heavy. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=52.18s)]
*  You have to be very strong to wear that. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=53.18s)]
*  That's the original, right? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=56.54s)]
*  So it's pretty good. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=57.78s)]
*  But I just want to thank everybody. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=59.5s)]
*  We're going to be with you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=61.54s)]
*  Your governor met us at the plane and we had a good talk, very, very positive talk. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=63.26s)]
*  We have to work together to get this really worked out. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=68.9s)]
*  I don't think you can realize how rough it is, how devastating it is until you see it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=72.58s)]
*  I didn't realize. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=79.98s)]
*  I mean, I saw a lot of bad things on television, but the extent of it, the size of it, we flew [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=80.98s)]
*  over it in a helicopter. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=86.08s)]
*  We flew a few of the areas and it is devastation. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=88.32s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=93.28s)]
*  It's really an incineration. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=94.28s)]
*  Even some of the chimneys came down, okay? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  When you have the chimneys come down, you know that's pretty hot stuff. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=99.6s)]
*  And a lot of them were down. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=102.8s)]
*  That was a bad sign too. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=104.84s)]
*  But I just want to commiserate and we're going to celebrate. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=107.24s)]
*  We'll be back to celebrate one day soon, I hope soon. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=112.64s)]
*  The federal government's standing behind you, 100 percent. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=116.16s)]
*  The First Lady and I are in California to express a great love for the people of California. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  I've had great support always in California. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=129.28s)]
*  We did very well recently, as you know, relatively speaking at least, I can say. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=132.24s)]
*  And it's been amazing. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=138.16s)]
*  I have property in California, not too far away actually, right up the road in Palos Verdes, a big property. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=140.0s)]
*  And I've always loved it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=146.52s)]
*  I've always loved being here. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  But we have to grieve for the 28 Californians who have tragically perished. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=150.4s)]
*  And sadly, you're going to be finding more. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=155.08s)]
*  And that's going to be very sad because I know people are missing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  And when you look at that kind of incineration, you know what's going to happen. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=163.88s)]
*  You're going to find some more. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=167.68s)]
*  But with all that we've gone through, I watched your firefighters. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=169.64s)]
*  And they were really fighting at a big disadvantage. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=175.88s)]
*  I got to know a lot of them just now, and they're incredible people. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=178.11999999999998s)]
*  They were so happy. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=181.72s)]
*  They were saying, congratulations, sir. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=183.16s)]
*  You know, they're thinking about country maybe even before this location that they all love. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  But I'm pleased to be joined by many of the great California leaders, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=191.32s)]
*  both Democrat and Republican. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=197.0s)]
*  And it's an honor to meet some of you I didn't know, but I know every one of you by name. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=200.83999999999997s)]
*  LA County Supervisor, Katherine Barger. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=205.39999999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Katherine, very much. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=207.76s)]
*  Mayor Karen Bass. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=210.51999999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Karen. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=212.76s)]
*  It's nice to meet you. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=213.56s)]
*  Representatives Jay Obernolte. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=215.72s)]
*  Where's Jay? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  Jay, hi, Jay. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=220.6s)]
*  It's been a tough period, Jay, right? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=222.0s)]
*  Vince Fong, Kevin Kiley, Vince. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=224.44s)]
*  Vince and Kevin, hi. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=228.2s)]
*  Hi, Vince. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=230.12s)]
*  A man I know very well. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=233.0s)]
*  I know him too well, actually. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=234.64s)]
*  And I say that actually with love, because he's actually been a great congressman for [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=238.44s)]
*  a long time, and he's a great leader, and he loves the area as much as anybody, right, Darrell? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  So Darrell, I say Young Kim. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=250.24s)]
*  Congratulations on an excellent career. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=254.72s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=257.8s)]
*  Another one I know pretty well is, to put it mildly, is Tom McClintock. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=259.32s)]
*  And he's been with us for a long time. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=264.76s)]
*  We have some interesting things going on in Washington. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=267.2s)]
*  And it's an honor that you have, that you guys are here. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=270.6s)]
*  Thank you, Darrell, very much, Tom. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=273.12s)]
*  George Whitesides. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=275.8s)]
*  Good George, thanks. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  It's a great name too, by the way. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=280.52s)]
*  Brad Sherman, I know Brad well. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=282.79999999999995s)]
*  I know Brad, but that's all right. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=285.67999999999995s)]
*  We're on the same side of this one. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=287.64s)]
*  I know that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=289.35999999999996s)]
*  We'll work together, Brad, very well. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  A lot of respect. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=291.96s)]
*  And presidential envoy Rick Grinnell, who's done a fantastic job for [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=293.71999999999997s)]
*  me over the years, he was ambassador to Germany. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=298.64s)]
*  And he was fantastic. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=303.47999999999996s)]
*  So two and a half weeks ago, over 100 mile an hour winds transformed. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=304.76s)]
*  Palisades fire and other areas too, into absolute infernos of death and destruction. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=309.6s)]
*  And this is already the most expensive natural disaster, they say, in American history. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=316.96000000000004s)]
*  That's pretty amazing. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=322.8s)]
*  The numbers are going to be staggering. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=326.56s)]
*  Most importantly, we have to get it built and we have to hopefully find as few people as possible. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  We have already too many, too many, 28 at least they say. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=334.24s)]
*  We're going to work very hard with the mayor, the governor, the supervisor, and everybody and get the resources behind you. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=341.92s)]
*  We have some amazing people and we have some amazing fighters for things like this. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=351.08s)]
*  I also had the concept of getting some of the best developers in the country. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=357.68s)]
*  We've had so many calls from developers and they want to come in, they don't want anything. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=362.28s)]
*  They just want to come in and help and they really know how to get things done and get things built. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=367.0s)]
*  I would ask that the local officials, because we're going to wave just about, essentially wave all federal permits. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  We're going to have you go very quickly because a federal permit can take ten years. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  We're not going to do that. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=383.79999999999995s)]
*  We're not going to, we don't want to take ten days. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  I would. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=387.0s)]
*  So we're declaring this a national emergency. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=392.28s)]
*  By doing that I can give you immediate, like immediate permits. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=397.84s)]
*  I'd ask that the local permitting process be the same. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=401.35999999999996s)]
*  Some of the people were saying they're going to have to, they're going to be forced to wait 18 months for their permits. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  And I don't think you're going to do that. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=412.11999999999995s)]
*  I can't imagine that. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=413.84s)]
*  So they are literally in a position right now they'd like to start tonight. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=414.79999999999995s)]
*  And they'll clean their site. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=418.88s)]
*  They'll do everything. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=421.16s)]
*  They just want to start. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=422.28000000000003s)]
*  And they were very concerned with the 18 months. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=424.32s)]
*  So I'm sure you can get it down to, I would say, not even 18 days. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=426.36s)]
*  They are ready, Mayor, they are ready to start. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=432.48s)]
*  They're, I met so many of them. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=435.48s)]
*  The fire took place. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=437.72s)]
*  It's nice and cool there now and they want to start taking the debris. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=438.92s)]
*  They want to take the debris. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=444.2s)]
*  They want to do everything. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  They'll get rid of everything. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=446.2s)]
*  They're going to do it by their own hand. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=447.6s)]
*  And you're going to see some amazing things happen. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=449.84s)]
*  So we're waiving the federal permits. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=453.0s)]
*  Either waive them or give them to you so rapidly it's not going to, it's going to be essentially the same thing. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=455.64s)]
*  But we're going to try and just waive them. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=460.23999999999995s)]
*  And we'll rely on the local. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=462.44s)]
*  But the local, I hope, is going to do the same exact thing. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=463.88s)]
*  They're literally ready to start right away tonight. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=466.84s)]
*  So if you could do almost the same thing or the same thing would be great. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=470.67999999999995s)]
*  For building permits, you're going to have to check things out a little bit. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=475.08s)]
*  A lot of them, every single one of them said they're going to rebuild. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=477.84s)]
*  I didn't have one person say they're selling or they're leaving or they're disgusted. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=482.15999999999997s)]
*  They love their community and it's incredible. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=486.84s)]
*  We even had one from your neck of the woods, right? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=489.71999999999997s)]
*  Do you want to stand up? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=494.28s)]
*  It was so nice the way you, she greeted. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=495.12s)]
*  She greeted my wife in a very different, in a very different language, right? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=500.91999999999996s)]
*  And it was very nice to see. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=506.92s)]
*  And you're staying and you're going to rebuild and everything else. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=509.2s)]
*  Yeah, everybody, everybody. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=511.71999999999997s)]
*  So it's really great. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=513.56s)]
*  So I'm signing an executive order to open up the pumps and valves in the north. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=514.24s)]
*  We want to get that water pouring down here as quickly as possible. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=521.0s)]
*  Let hundreds of millions of gallons of water flow down into Southern California. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=524.24s)]
*  And that'll be a big benefit to you. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=529.72s)]
*  Look, if you don't want it, you're going to tell me, but just, I can't imagine it. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=532.28s)]
*  I tell you who does like it is the fire department. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=537.6s)]
*  When I said that, they were very happy with that. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=539.68s)]
*  They didn't mind hearing that. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=542.1999999999999s)]
*  But we have a lot of water that is available. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=544.12s)]
*  And I hope you can work that out among yourselves. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=547.88s)]
*  But I think this will show that we have to have that water. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=551.0799999999999s)]
*  We have to have that water. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=555.76s)]
*  We're talking about unlimited water coming up from the Pacific Northwest, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=557.48s)]
*  even coming up from parts of Canada. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=562.4s)]
*  And it pours down naturally. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=566.08s)]
*  It has for a million years, for a million years it pours down. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=567.72s)]
*  You'll never run out. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=570.8000000000001s)]
*  You'll never have shortages and you won't have things like this. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=572.36s)]
*  And when you do, you'll have a lot of water to put it out. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=576.5600000000001s)]
*  So I'm going to ask that you figure that out. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=579.84s)]
*  I really strongly recommended this seven years ago. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=582.8399999999999s)]
*  And I think I'm going to just do it. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=589.4s)]
*  If you have big problems, you're going to let me know, but I just can't even imagine it. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=592.92s)]
*  But we're also surging federal resources and assistance to the state. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=596.7199999999999s)]
*  And California must adopt the common sense policies to prevent fires. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=603.16s)]
*  And we all know that we were talking seven or eight years ago. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=608.0s)]
*  I was talking to people from Austria, people from Finland, people that live in forests. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=611.68s)]
*  One of the gentlemen, one of the top great leaders of Austria said, we don't have forest fires. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=619.5999999999999s)]
*  And we have trees that are actually far more flammable than they have in California. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=625.64s)]
*  But they literally rake their forest. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=631.28s)]
*  They take down, if a tree comes down, they take it down. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=634.04s)]
*  They say you have 18 months after that, it's like a matchstick. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=636.8s)]
*  And I know environmentally, some environmental groups like the trees to just melt into the ground. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=639.4s)]
*  But when they do melt into the ground, they become an inferno. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=645.36s)]
*  So I think you're going to have to change your ways in terms of that. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=649.36s)]
*  You have 30 years of leaves, and those leaves are dry as a bone, and they burn. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=653.12s)]
*  Interestingly, because I was at Paradise, who is the general, right? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=658.68s)]
*  Long time ago, I was at Paradise. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=663.0s)]
*  What a beautiful paradise it was. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=664.92s)]
*  And how is it doing, by the way? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=667.16s)]
*  Are they rebuilding, right? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=670.3199999999999s)]
*  Remember when he said, you were up here, President. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=672.0s)]
*  I went there, I never saw anything like it. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=675.1999999999999s)]
*  But you know what amazed me? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=676.88s)]
*  I'll never forget it. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=678.52s)]
*  The trees were okay, because the trees are loaded with water. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=680.1999999999999s)]
*  They suck that water out of the ground. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=684.16s)]
*  And this was an inferno, just like, I would say no different than this. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=686.0s)]
*  And it was also the wind that caused a lot of problems. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=690.36s)]
*  I mean, you had tremendous winds that there's not a lot you're going to do with. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=693.28s)]
*  It was up to 100 mile an hour winds, it's unheard of. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=696.16s)]
*  But when I was in Paradise, I noticed that the trees, they were dark on the bottom, but [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=700.52s)]
*  they were absolutely living, and they lived. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=705.0799999999999s)]
*  Because they're soaking wet. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=708.0s)]
*  But the trees that were on the ground, within 12 to 18 months, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=710.0799999999999s)]
*  they say 18 months at a maximum, you have to cut them up, take them away, because they're matchsticks. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=714.48s)]
*  But we saw that, you saw that with me. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=719.7199999999999s)]
*  I commented at the time, I said, look at this, the house is burned down, and the tree is standing. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=721.52s)]
*  Other than being a little different color on the bottom, and it went through an inferno. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=726.3199999999999s)]
*  It's amazing, soaking wet. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=730.36s)]
*  So I think they have to do it. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=732.92s)]
*  It's called management of the floor. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=734.0799999999999s)]
*  And when the gentleman from Austria and also Finland and other countries, they said, we manage the forest. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=737.12s)]
*  President Trump is speaking. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=744.88s)]
*  He's expected to get a briefing from fire officials in Los Angeles County on the devastating wildfires. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=746.0s)]
*  He said that the extent in size was worth seeing in person from his helicopter tour. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=752.08s)]
*  He called it devastation and incineration, saying he's grieving for the 24 Californians who have perished, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=756.56s)]
*  saying he's getting calls from developers that they're asking to come in and help, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=762.44s)]
*  and that he will waive all federal permits. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=766.16s)]
*  Remember, today he also threatened pulling federal aid unless California reconfigures its water management. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyYo_DgtHiQ&t=768.4s)]
