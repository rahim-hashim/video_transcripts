# Kash Patel's role in hostage rescue at center of whistleblower's allegations
**CBS News:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc)
*  This week, the former Trump aide picked by the president to lead the FBI will face questions [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=0.0s)]
*  from the Senate Judiciary Committee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=4.28s)]
*  The confirmation hearing for Cash Patel is scheduled for Thursday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=6.38s)]
*  Patel's critics argue he doesn't have the experience or temperament for the role. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=9.92s)]
*  Now CBS News has learned an anonymous FBI insider has come forward with new information [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=13.8s)]
*  questioning Patel's judgment during sensitive hostage rescue missions, or at least one of [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=19.34s)]
*  them. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=24.64s)]
*  CBS News investigative reporter Dan Kleiman is here with me in Studio 57. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=25.64s)]
*  What is this bureau insider saying? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=28.84s)]
*  Well what he came forward and told the Senate Judiciary Committee, at least Democrats on [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  the Senate Judiciary Committee a few days ago, is that while he was working on the FBI's [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=35.8s)]
*  hostage recovery fusion cell, which is the entity that kind of coordinates hostage releases [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  and rescues around the world, that Cash Patel sort of inserted himself into the process. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=48.68s)]
*  He was a NSC staffer during the first Trump term. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=55.04s)]
*  This is in late October of 2020. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=58.32s)]
*  And that Patel violated protocols by going to the Wall Street Journal and confirming [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=61.64s)]
*  to them that these hostages, these American hostages in Yemen had been released, when [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=68.56s)]
*  in fact they were not yet safely confirmed in U.S. custody and their families had not [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=73.88s)]
*  been notified. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=79.12s)]
*  Well, that really bent out of shape, people in the FBI, because they worried that if you [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=80.12s)]
*  get out ahead with this kind of news, that it could jeopardize the release of the hostages [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=86.18s)]
*  and that it is not fair to the families. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=95.42s)]
*  What are Democrats doing with this information and what other information are they seeking? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=98.2s)]
*  Well they've interviewed this insider, effectively a whistleblower, and they have now written [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=102.10000000000001s)]
*  a letter signed by Senator Durbin, who's the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=109.22s)]
*  Committee, talking about this information and asking the United States government, the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=114.62s)]
*  Trump administration, to supply all records and communications between Patel and any of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=121.06s)]
*  these entities, any of these people involved in this process to find out what happened, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=130.16s)]
*  to try to verify what this whistleblower's claims are. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=133.74s)]
*  So they sent the letter to the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Treasury, the current [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=136.6s)]
*  acting FBI director, and others as well to get this information. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=144.1s)]
*  They're gathering it and they plan to question Patel closely on Thursday at his confirmation [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=148.26s)]
*  hearing. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=153.26s)]
*  I know your story just dropped on CBSNews.com, but have we heard any reaction from Republicans [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=154.26s)]
*  yet and in your reporting is this considered egregious enough that some GOP senators could [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=157.98s)]
*  oppose his confirmation? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=162.74s)]
*  I don't think we know enough to know whether any GOP senators would oppose the nomination. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=164.7s)]
*  What we've heard from the administration, they are staunchly defending Cash Patel. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=170.38s)]
*  They're saying that he has all of the qualifications to be FBI director and that there's no truth [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=176.44s)]
*  to this FBI insider's information. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=183.38s)]
*  So that's the position, and at this point, it's a question of getting the details, airing [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=187.06s)]
*  this and seeing what the reaction is politically. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=192.66s)]
*  I mean, forgive me if I'm oversimplifying it, but shouldn't it be something that would [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=194.57999999999998s)]
*  be easily provable by going back to the Wall Street Journal and finding out, you know, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=197.86s)]
*  finding the quote, et cetera, the timing of it all? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=202.42000000000002s)]
*  I mean, this isn't something that should take weeks. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=204.42000000000002s)]
*  It should not. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=207.66000000000003s)]
*  I'm assuming they will get to the bottom of this. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=208.9s)]
*  You know, I think the question is when he spoke to the Wall Street Journal, which was [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=212.26000000000002s)]
*  1055 on October 14th, 2020, what exactly, where were the hostages at that point? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=216.54000000000002s)]
*  Were they on a plane headed to the United States or to U.S. custody? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=223.9s)]
*  Had the handoff occurred? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=228.70000000000002s)]
*  Some of those questions still have to be answered, and I'm assuming we will know by the time [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=230.5s)]
*  this confirmation hearing takes place. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=234.94s)]
*  Okay, everybody can go to cbsnews.com and read your full reporting. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=236.78s)]
*  Dan Clydeman, thank you. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=239.62s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Lindsay. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBH4yh7Zrc&t=240.62s)]
