# Senate committee vote on Patel, employee purge at FBI, more | CBS News 24/7
**CBS News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA)
*  Hi everyone, I'm Vladimir Dutiyet. For the next hour I'm going to be taking you through [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=0.0s)]
*  all the news that's happening in the United States and around the world. And I'm getting [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=5.08s)]
*  that news from these monitors right behind me. These are feeds coming into the CBS News [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=8.28s)]
*  broadcast center from all of our stations and affiliates around the country. You will [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  only find that analysis and that deep reporting right here, CBS News 24 seven. So let's begin. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=16.38s)]
*  New allegations are swirling that President Trump's pick for FBI Director Cash Patel lied [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=22.68s)]
*  under oath and Secretary and orchestrated a wave of firings at the bureau before being [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=27.04s)]
*  officially confirmed. There's a word missing in that teleprompter. That's okay. We're going [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=34.72s)]
*  to keep going. We're also tracking two dangerous storm systems on both coasts this morning. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=38.24s)]
*  We're going to tell you who needs to be on high alert and where the threatening conditions [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=42.32s)]
*  are moving next. And we're going to take you inside a notorious El Salvadorian prison where [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  some of the most dangerous and violent killers are locked up. This is the United States considers [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=51.58s)]
*  incarcerating migrant deportees in that country. This is CBS News 24 seven. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=56.0s)]
*  Let's begin on Capitol Hill where the Senate Judiciary Committee is holding a meeting on the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=70.4s)]
*  nomination of Cash Patel to be the next director of the FBI. But his nomination has hit some [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=73.88s)]
*  speed bumps, including allegations that Patel may have committed perjury during his [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=78.88s)]
*  confirmation process and overstepped his actual authority. So I want to bring in CBS News [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=83.12s)]
*  congressional correspondent Caitlin Huey Burns to talk a little bit more about this. So Caitlin, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=88.4s)]
*  Democratic Senator Dick Durbin is accusing Patel of conducting a wave of firings at the FBI [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  without having been confirmed yet. But of course, we led with the fact that he may have perjured [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  himself on the stand. Break that down for me. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  Hey, Vlad, good to see you. Yeah. And as you saw, he is they're having that vote right now in [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  committee to move him forward, which is likely to actually happen. But this is all stemming from [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=112.64s)]
*  a letter that Dick Durbin, Durbin, who is a senior member on that committee, put forward a [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=119.04s)]
*  couple of days ago, which is alleging that Cash Patel had essentially directed firings at the FBI [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=125.12s)]
*  already before obviously taking this position. This is referring to a some reporting that he says [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=134.0s)]
*  that he has that shows that acting director Boeve was issuing these directives or talking about [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=142.24s)]
*  these directives from Stephen Miller, a chief White House person as well. So this is a lot of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  complications here. But Durbin is alleging that Patel may have perjured himself by saying that he [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=156.24s)]
*  has not done any of this. But but again, this is the bigger part of this is and I should say the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=162.72s)]
*  FBI hasn't commented, DOJ hasn't commented and the top Republican on the committee, Chuck Grassley, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=169.92s)]
*  has said that this is all an attempt by Democrats to slow this process. Remember, he was supposed [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=176.16s)]
*  to be confirmed out of this committee last week and Democrats stalled that process, pushed it [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=181.27999999999997s)]
*  forward a week. So Democrats have very little at their disposal to try and stop these nominations [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=187.11999999999998s)]
*  outright. And this is one way for them to do that. Is this going to have any impact on whether he [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  gets through? No, not really. We don't know of any Republican yet who has said that they are going [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=198.8s)]
*  to vote against him. He's likely to get voted out of this committee momentarily and he will likely [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=204.24s)]
*  get voted out of the full Senate as soon as they file for that vote. All right, we'll be watching [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=210.24s)]
*  for that. Caitlin, what else are we expecting on the Hill this morning? Well, RFK Jr. is going to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=214.8s)]
*  have his confirmation vote in the full Senate this morning and just around 1030. So later this hour [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=220.96s)]
*  and he is likely to get confirmed. The big picture here, Vlad, is that we started out this process [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=228.32s)]
*  with Donald Trump naming several controversial picks. There were big questions about whether [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=234.88s)]
*  these picks could get through a Senate that has a narrow Republican majority and what we're learning [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=240.4s)]
*  is that they are. We saw Tulsi Gabbard confirmed yesterday with just one Republican no vote, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  Mitch McConnell. We are expecting RFK Jr. to get through. We've already seen some of the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=253.6s)]
*  more moderate Republicans like Lisa Murkowski and others. So what's significant here is that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=259.12s)]
*  the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill feels very comfortable with the pace at which they are [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=266.88s)]
*  making these confirmations and they are looking for the president to have his full cabinet soon. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=272.64s)]
*  All right, Caitlin, Huey Burns, a lot of activity on the Hill. Thank you very much for bringing it [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=279.68s)]
*  to us. We'll check in with you a little bit later. Now, as we focus on Cash Patel's confirmation [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=284.96s)]
*  process, I want to bring in CBS News Department of Justice correspondent Scott McFarlane to talk a [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=289.36s)]
*  little bit more about this. So Scott, what are you hearing from your sources about these firings at [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=293.04s)]
*  the FBI? The concern is that they're going to expand, Vlad. There's already been this list [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=297.52s)]
*  compiled of FBI agents and employees who were part of the January 6 investigation. That's about [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=304.24s)]
*  5,000 people, any number of whom are concerned they're going to get fired simply for touching [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=309.68s)]
*  that case. But there's now an expanding concern. There's been already in the past 24 hours this [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  move against other agency federal workers who are what they call probationary, new to the job, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=322.24s)]
*  without the full protections of a longtime civil servant. There's a lot of FBI agents who fit that [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=327.44s)]
*  category too, potentially more than a thousand FBI agents who the federal government considers [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=333.12s)]
*  probationary, new, without full protections. An association representing FBI employees issued [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=338.88s)]
*  a warning last night saying if you move against all of those workers, you could lose another [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  thousand FBI agents, which would gut some of the critical task forces and missions inside the FBI. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=349.52s)]
*  Could be child predator task forces, terrorism task forces, violent crime task forces, and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  a significant loss of institutional memory and an awful lot of time would be needed, Vlad, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=365.36s)]
*  to find, recruit, train, and background check replacement FBI agents. So that's making Americans [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=371.52000000000004s)]
*  less safe. And as you know, Scott, oftentimes with these FBI agents and with the department, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=379.04s)]
*  the Federal Bureau of Investigation, we don't hear about the wins. We only hear about the failures, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=384.48s)]
*  which are, thank God, few and far between. But this signals that we may see a bit more of those [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  in the years ahead. Let me ask you about this bizarre press conference that the attorney general, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=394.88000000000005s)]
*  Pam Bondi, held yesterday. The Department of Justice, as you know, announced that it's suing [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  New York State over its immigration policies. But the way that the attorney general led that [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=402.88000000000005s)]
*  press conference by announcing that she had filed charges against individuals in New York State led [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  a lot of people, including myself, not being a lawyer to wonder if she was filing criminal [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  charges against people like Letitia James. Instead, we find out that she's just suing them and she had [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=419.76000000000005s)]
*  actually hasn't filed anything. What more can you tell us? It was an untraditional [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=424.48s)]
*  news conference. I was in the room at the Department of Justice. There was a gasp [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=428.48s)]
*  among those in the audience on press row when she initially indicated there'd be criminal charges [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=432.64000000000004s)]
*  against the governor and other key players in New York State. And she immediately clarified that this [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=439.6s)]
*  is a civil lawsuit, the likes of which there are thousands and tens of thousands across the country, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=444.40000000000003s)]
*  including in New York each year. They also did not have a copy of the lawsuit to share during [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=449.12s)]
*  this press conference. That's untraditional, but it also sowed some confusion about what exactly [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=456.4s)]
*  is being alleged here and what type of damages is the U.S. Department of Justice seeking. Some of [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  that's going to be clarified at a federal courthouse in Albany, the state capital, where the state [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=466.48s)]
*  government is headquartered as the Department of Justice tries to make an argument here that the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=471.2s)]
*  state of New York is not cracking down hard enough on undocumented immigrants. If this lawsuit goes [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=476.16s)]
*  anywhere is a different story, but a political message has been sent. The first message by this [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=482.96000000000004s)]
*  attorney general at that podium in this administration. So just, Scott, so I understand. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=487.76000000000005s)]
*  There's nothing, there's no paperwork yet. Nothing has actually been filed. This is an intention to [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=494.08000000000004s)]
*  sue or they have already filed a paperwork that suggests that they are suing the governor and [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=498.24s)]
*  others, but they're not filing any criminal charges. This is what's different, Vlad. This [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=504.24s)]
*  suit was not ready when it was announced. That's uncommon among federal prosecutors. It was made [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=508.88s)]
*  available late last night to some reporters, CBS News included. We expected to hit the public [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=514.72s)]
*  docket today in Albany, but this will take weeks and months, maybe years to litigate and adjudicate. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=520.72s)]
*  There's no criminal component to this case. When the press conference began with an allusion [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=526.48s)]
*  to criminal charges, it was a misspeaking or a miscommunication by the attorney general. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=532.48s)]
*  All right, Scott McFarland, always grateful for you, my friend, for providing that clarity [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=538.48s)]
*  that I and I guess a lot of other people sorely need. Thank you, Scott. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=542.8000000000001s)]
*  Thanks, Vlad. All right. Police in Munich have arrested a suspect accused of driving into a [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=546.08s)]
*  union demonstration and injuring dozens of people. The suspected attack happened just [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=550.88s)]
*  hours before Vice President JD Vance arrived in Munich to discuss the war in Ukraine. So I [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=556.32s)]
*  want to bring in CBS News foreign correspondent Holly Williams to talk a little bit more about this. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=560.56s)]
*  Holly, what do we know about this incident? Good morning, Vlad. Well, German police say that [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=564.9599999999999s)]
*  at least 28 people were injured, including some children, some people seriously, after that man [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=569.68s)]
*  drove his car into a crowd at around 1030 this morning local time at a square near downtown [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=575.28s)]
*  Munich. As you know, world leaders are gathering in Munich today ahead of a security conference [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=581.52s)]
*  tomorrow, including Vice President JD Vance and Ukraine's President Vladimir Zelensky. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=587.2s)]
*  The police say that they fired a shot at the car and then detained the driver, who they say is [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=591.9200000000001s)]
*  believed to be a 24-year-old asylum seeker from Afghanistan. Now, the governor of that region, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=598.1600000000001s)]
*  Bavaria, said that the incident is suspected to have been an attack. The crowd was gathered there [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=604.4000000000001s)]
*  for a protest organized by a union. Now, Germany goes to the polls for a national election in [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=610.8000000000001s)]
*  just over a week. Immigration is already a key issue, and this incident will likely play into [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=616.96s)]
*  that at that national election. Wow. All right, we'll be tracking that throughout the next couple [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=624.32s)]
*  of days, Holly. Let's pivot to a discussion that we started yesterday about Ukraine. As you know, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=629.6800000000001s)]
*  President Trump spoke with both Vladimir Putin and President Zelensky of Ukraine this morning. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=636.32s)]
*  He posted that he feels that a deal can be reached to stop the war. As you can imagine, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=641.2800000000001s)]
*  there is mixed reaction to this. First, I want to play, Holly, for you, sound from the former [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=645.52s)]
*  ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor. Listen to what he had to say. I think there is a real [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=650.16s)]
*  possibility. I think there is a real possibility. All sides want it. The Russians are hurting. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=655.12s)]
*  They need to stop this war. They've got incredible economic problems. The Ukrainians obviously want [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=660.48s)]
*  to stop this war, and Europeans do, and the United States does. So, yes, I think there's a real [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=665.76s)]
*  possibility this war could end this year. All right, so folks want the war to end. That's clear, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=670.64s)]
*  but Holly, this is a post from former National Security Advisor John Bolton, and it says in part, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=676.56s)]
*  it is unconscionable to allow Russia to assault Ukraine's sovereignty, recruit enemies like North [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=682.0s)]
*  Korea to aid in their fight, and then sell out the Ukrainians by conceding the loss of their [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=687.1999999999999s)]
*  territory and NATO security guarantees or membership. By making these and other concessions [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=691.84s)]
*  before negotiations even started, Trump has effectively surrendered to Putin on Ukraine. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=697.04s)]
*  I saw another post from Ambassador Bolton, Holly, where he said that the Kremlin is drinking vodka [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=702.7199999999999s)]
*  straight from the bottle after hearing from President Trump yesterday. What are you hearing [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=709.28s)]
*  from your sources on the ground about this? Well, look, President Trump sounded very positive, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=714.24s)]
*  didn't he, after that phone call with Putin? The Kremlin said that the phone call lasted nearly [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=719.36s)]
*  one and a half hours. I think here's the problem for Ukrainians. What kind of ceasefire will Trump [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=723.76s)]
*  and Putin negotiate, and will it actually bring a lasting peace to Ukraine? I mean, yesterday, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=730.16s)]
*  the Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegs, said that while the U.S. supports an independent Ukraine, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=736.16s)]
*  it does not support NATO membership for Ukraine with all the security guarantees [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=741.4399999999999s)]
*  that that would bring. The U.S., he said, would not contribute soldiers to any international [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=745.76s)]
*  peacekeeping force in Ukraine. And he also said that returning Ukraine to its pre-2014 borders [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=750.4s)]
*  was, quote, unrealistic. So as a result, some Ukrainians fear that a ceasefire negotiated by [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=756.8s)]
*  President Trump could involve handing over part of their country, part of their territory to Russia [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=762.72s)]
*  without the security guarantees they want to stop Vladimir Putin reinvading, doing it all over again [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=768.0799999999999s)]
*  in a few years' time. If that happened, it would be, it would effectively be a huge victory for [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=774.88s)]
*  Vladimir Putin. It would reward him for invading Ukraine and igniting a war that has killed [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=781.4399999999999s)]
*  hundreds of, not killed, but caused hundreds of thousands of casualties on both sides. Vlad? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=787.92s)]
*  And really quickly before you go, and I know this is happening in real time because the news is still [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=793.4399999999999s)]
*  just breaking, but has there been any reaction from Brussels? I've seen some statements from [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=798.24s)]
*  European leaders that anything that happens with regards to ultimately a deal happening between [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=804.24s)]
*  Ukraine and Russia, the Europeans would have to be involved and be supportive of it. So what are [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=809.52s)]
*  you hearing from on that front? So look, the Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegs, had said yesterday [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=813.44s)]
*  that Europe needs to do more for European security. And we've heard the same thing from, you know, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=818.16s)]
*  from European defense ministers, that Europe should do more, that Europe should step up its [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=822.64s)]
*  efforts. But in an interview, a recent interview by Ukraine's President Vladimir Zelensky, he said that [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=827.28s)]
*  any security guarantees for Ukraine need to include the United States. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=833.2s)]
*  All right, Holly Williams with that deep analysis for us this morning. Holly, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=839.6s)]
*  I appreciate you so much. Thank you. All right, folks, coming up, we're going to go to an [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=842.88s)]
*  Ensalvadorian prison and take you into one prison housing some of the most violent criminals. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=849.2s)]
*  Is it possible to get a tattoo like this if you're not a gang member? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=858.0s)]
*  You gotta kill. You gotta kill to get those tattoos. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=862.8s)]
*  And that incredible reporting from our Lillie Luciano. Just ahead, you're streaming CBS News 24 [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=866.9599999999999s)]
*  7. Dangerous winter weather is threatening both the West and East Coast right now. Tens of thousands [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=872.24s)]
*  are without power and millions are under winter weather alerts. The Eastern U.S. is preparing for [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=884.16s)]
*  more snow as, like New Jersey, are still digging out from the last storm. And out West, California [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=889.2s)]
*  is bracing for possible mudslides from flash flooding. CBS News Colorado reporter Kennedy [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=897.6s)]
*  Cook is out in Denver and joins me now to talk more about it. So, Kennedy, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=903.36s)]
*  how cold is it supposed to get there and how are residents preparing? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=908.4000000000001s)]
*  Hey, Vlad. Good morning to you. As of right now, we're standing at a whopping five degrees. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=912.1600000000001s)]
*  It is about eight o'clock. Excuse me. Mountain time here in Colorado. When we first got out here, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=920.4000000000001s)]
*  it was about one degree. So we've gotten up in temperature today. We're expected to see [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=927.2800000000001s)]
*  middle 40 temperatures here, but it is extremely cold in Colorado. We're actually coming off a [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=931.2800000000001s)]
*  stretch of a historic shelter in place. Shelters all across the metro area in the high country [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=936.5600000000001s)]
*  have been open for people to come get warm. It was open for basically the entire month of January. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=941.44s)]
*  We had a really nice first couple weeks here of February, but we are back to those cold temperatures. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=946.08s)]
*  And Kennedy, how are officials dealing with these back to back storms and what are they telling [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=952.32s)]
*  residents? Yeah, it's all about preparation here, prepping yourself, prepping your plants, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=956.16s)]
*  your animals. Well, we have been telling everybody here on CBS Colorado is if you don't have to be [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=964.08s)]
*  out in the cold, maybe just don't go out in the cold. But again, those cold weather shelters have [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=968.64s)]
*  been open throughout Colorado. Lots of opportunities at local rec centers, libraries, and plenty of [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=973.2s)]
*  places for people to go and check out to make sure that they're staying nice and warm. And those [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=978.96s)]
*  operations have been reopened after that historic stretch I was just telling you about. So there's [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=983.2800000000001s)]
*  resources in the community. But I think the note here as for myself, as I was just warming up here [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=987.36s)]
*  in my car, if you don't have to be outside, you probably don't need to be outside. Good advice. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=992.32s)]
*  Kennedy Cook, thank you very much. All right, let's bring in CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=996.88s)]
*  Grant Gilmore with the first look at the national forecast. Hey, Grant. Hey, Vlad, look, this winter [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1004.08s)]
*  has been relentless. Let me zoom out here. Let me show you what's going on across the country. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1009.5200000000001s)]
*  I'm going to put on the radar and then we'll put on those current temperatures that we have across [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1013.2800000000001s)]
*  the United States. Because if it's not a winter storm, it's that Arctic air that it's invading a [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1017.52s)]
*  good portion of the central United States. Seven degrees right now in Denver, but some places across [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1022.96s)]
*  the northern tier are dealing with temperatures 10 to 20 degrees below zero. And that's not even [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1028.8s)]
*  talking about the wind chill. We've got a departing storm system up to the northeast. And then you've [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1034.8s)]
*  got another atmospheric river event that is beginning to really inundate the west coast. Look [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1038.96s)]
*  at all the high elevation snow moving into the Sierra Nevada and portions into the higher [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1045.04s)]
*  elevations to the north. But then also you've got a lot of rain that will be moving over California [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1048.8799999999999s)]
*  over the next couple of days, especially in the southern California. We're really going to have [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1054.96s)]
*  to keep a close eye on the threat for some land and some mudslides. All of these winter storm [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1059.12s)]
*  warnings, you've got winter weather advisories, even some ice storm concerns as we make our way [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1064.6399999999999s)]
*  through the next 36 hours or so. Multiple impacts with this here. Heavy rainfall. Some places could [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1070.32s)]
*  get three to even up to nearly a foot of rainfall. Ten inches of snow or rain in some places with two [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1076.56s)]
*  to four feet of snow in the higher elevations. I mentioned the flooding concerns in southern [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1082.96s)]
*  California. That's going to be a legitimate thing to watch out for as we watch this heavy rainfall [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1088.24s)]
*  move into some of those burn scars from the fires as we saw just last month. Severe weather across [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1092.6399999999999s)]
*  the south as we go into the weekend. We've got an elevated risk for severe weather. We'll talk more [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1098.8799999999999s)]
*  about this, Vlad, because it's not just winter weather, but it's severe weather in February and [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1103.2s)]
*  that could mean some tornadoes. We'll talk more about that in just a bit. Back to you for now. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1107.28s)]
*  All right. Can't wait. Talk to you a little bit later, Grant. Thank you very much. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1111.28s)]
*  Just one day after we talked about consumer prices being higher, we learned wholesale prices also [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1115.12s)]
*  rose. So the producer price index or PPI jumped four-tenths of a percent. That is higher than [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1120.3999999999999s)]
*  expected and could be another indicator that the progress against inflation has stalled. So I want [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1125.2s)]
*  to bring in CBS News Money Watch correspondent Kelly O'Grady, who joins me now in Studio 55 to [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1130.88s)]
*  talk more about this. So what caused PPI to tick up? Yeah. So let's remember this is producer [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1135.28s)]
*  prices. And so this is the cost that producers pay when they're producing the goods that then [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1140.72s)]
*  they sell to us. So the two biggest ones were what's called travel accommodation services. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1145.1200000000001s)]
*  So basically that means the cost for your restaurants, your hotels, think about the [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1150.72s)]
*  hospitality sector that jumped 5.7% versus last month. So that's much higher than that. That [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1155.92s)]
*  overall 0.4% number. The other one, and this is such an important one, is diesel. That rose 10.2%. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1162.08s)]
*  And I always call diesel the canary in the coal mine when it comes to inflation, because think [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1170.48s)]
*  about it. Every diesel impacts different products that are made. It's also what trucks run on that [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1175.2s)]
*  transport everything. I do want to note the market isn't really reacting like we saw it with CPI [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1180.88s)]
*  yesterday, and that's because some of the earlier costs in the pipeline, so airfare, some medical [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1186.24s)]
*  ones as well, it sort of showed that maybe we might see relief for producer prices in the next [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1194.0s)]
*  few reports. So I don't want to ask you to predict, but and we talked about how yesterday these are [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1199.52s)]
*  indicators from when Biden was still president of the United States, right? These are coming in from [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1205.92s)]
*  from December and January, but I wonder what it's going to look like next month when we get these [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1210.64s)]
*  numbers. Yeah, so that's kind of, they're reading the tea leaves and they're saying it actually [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1216.0s)]
*  might come down a little bit. That being said, let's be honest, Vlad, yesterday we thought CPI, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1220.88s)]
*  based on all the economists predicting, was going to come in lower than expected, and it actually [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1225.8400000000001s)]
*  increased. So sometimes the reading of the tea leaves is not great. I think what's really important [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1230.64s)]
*  about the PPI though is that when this rises, that is the warning sign that we're going to see [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1234.8s)]
*  consumer prices rise. Because as it costs more for producers to produce, they pass those costs on to [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1240.48s)]
*  us. Exactly. And so that's why I was curious about what the CPI could look like, because my guess [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1248.24s)]
*  would be that prices would be higher. Exactly, exactly. You will see that cost get pushed down [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1253.2s)]
*  to us when we go to the grocery store or wherever, and just a little plug from the Money Watch team, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1258.72s)]
*  there is a tracker that you can use. It is cbsnews.com prices. So you can just sort of track [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1263.92s)]
*  those prices online. You can track the prices of household goods and the things that are essential [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1271.44s)]
*  to consumers. All right, let's talk about the president on True Social this morning, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1274.5600000000002s)]
*  talking about reciprocal tariffs, which are coming today. So which of the countries are going to be [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1280.4s)]
*  impacted by this? Okay, so big ones are going to be India. It's going to be Vietnam. China, of course. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1285.3600000000001s)]
*  We've already imposed tariffs on them under his administration and previous administrations. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1292.88s)]
*  There's also this question of the VAT with Europe. Oh, that's interesting. Yes, it's a tax that [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1297.52s)]
*  exports when they're coming from, let's say, the U.S. When they go to Europe, it's a tax that's paid. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1304.8000000000002s)]
*  It's not really a tariff. And so we're going to see whether that is something that the president— [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1310.64s)]
*  He's applying VATs here? No, so Europe applies a VAT. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1314.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you usually go to the airport and then you fill out the form. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1318.5600000000002s)]
*  Exactly. So that's one. But for example, in Europe, cars specifically, there's a 10% [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1322.8799999999999s)]
*  tax on American cars going over to Europe. It's only about 2.5% coming into the country. So you [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1330.08s)]
*  could see that specifically go up to match that 10%. Wow. All right. Yeah, this is going to be [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1335.6799999999998s)]
*  very interesting because on one hand, as you say, these tariffs, long-term may be a good play for [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1341.6s)]
*  the United States, but short-term, there's going to be some pain. And actually, the president did [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1346.8799999999999s)]
*  say that in a tweet, a few, whatever they're calling them now. What are the young people [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1350.72s)]
*  calling them? Exes? Posts? I don't know. I'm still in the tweet age. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1355.2s)]
*  Me too. Kelly, always great to have you here. Thank you very much. All right. President Trump's [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1358.8s)]
*  pick to lead the Department of Education is facing lawmakers as the future of the department is [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1364.48s)]
*  actually in limbo. We're going to talk about it. You're streaming CBS News 24-7. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1368.64s)]
*  Here's a look at some of the top stories we're following. You're looking at the moment a US [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1380.72s)]
*  Navy fighter jet crashed near downtown San Diego. The aircraft was flying in low visibility conditions [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1386.96s)]
*  near a crowded neighborhood before it came crashing down into the San Diego Bay. Both pilots safely [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1392.56s)]
*  ejected and parachuted into the water. They were rescued by some nearby fishermen. The US Navy is [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1398.16s)]
*  investigating the cause of the crash. A gas explosion at a mall in Taiwan has killed at [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1403.28s)]
*  least four people and injured dozens. Officials say the blast came from the food court on the [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1408.16s)]
*  12th floor. It sent debris and fragments raining down onto the streets below. The cause remains [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1413.0400000000002s)]
*  under investigation. And Elon Musk is now saying he will drop the $97 billion bid to take over [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1418.0800000000002s)]
*  OpenAI if it remains a nonprofit. Musk made the unsolicited offer earlier this week, leading a [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1424.72s)]
*  group of investors in purchasing the nonprofit assets that control the company. But in a new [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1430.5600000000002s)]
*  court filing, Musk claims he'll rescind the offer if OpenAI board is quote prepared to preserve the [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1435.04s)]
*  charity's mission. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman immediately rejected Musk's offer saying the company is not for sale. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1440.32s)]
*  All right, President Trump's nominee for Secretary of Education is on Capitol Hill this morning for [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1450.1599999999999s)]
*  a confirmation hearing. But former WWE executive Linda McMahon's appearance comes at a time when [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1454.24s)]
*  the president has called for the elimination of the department. So let's bring in CBS News White [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1460.08s)]
*  House reporter Willie James in a minute. Talk about it. So Willie James, the DOE has already come [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1464.48s)]
*  under attack for its support of several DEI initiatives. What else do we know about the [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1469.92s)]
*  president's criticism of the agency? And just for our viewers to understand, the president can say [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1474.4s)]
*  that he wants to get rid of the Department of Education, but only Congress can actually do away with it. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1479.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great point, Vlad. That's exactly right. Of course, the Department of Education was [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1486.72s)]
*  created during the Carter administration decades ago. And if the president wants to completely [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1491.12s)]
*  dismantle it, he will need Congress' buy-in. Now, there has been a bill introduced to do just that, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1496.9599999999998s)]
*  but nonetheless, President Trump has said that he wants to essentially eliminate the Department [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1502.8s)]
*  of Education. Just yesterday, he said, I'd like it to be closed immediately. I'm quoting him here. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1508.1599999999999s)]
*  He also said the Department of Education is a quote is a big con job. Now, we do know that Doge, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1513.1999999999998s)]
*  led by Elon Musk, has gone after the department to cut about a billion dollars in contracts, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1519.28s)]
*  some of those contracts related to a DEI. As you mentioned, in Trump, the president, rather, has [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1526.08s)]
*  really just blasted not only the Department of Education, but other government agencies as well. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1533.6s)]
*  But this is clearly a department that the president is keenly focused on. He mentioned as much during [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1539.84s)]
*  the campaign, and Linda McMahon would lead the department. But it's perhaps one of the jobs in [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1545.76s)]
*  Washington that you don't want, because it's one of the jobs that the president is seeking to [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1550.48s)]
*  eliminate. But still, nonetheless, the White House is seeking to confirm Linda McMahon as the [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1554.16s)]
*  secretary of education, and perhaps then will make those moves to come up with an executive order to [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1559.52s)]
*  dismantle it in some type of way. But as we both mentioned, he will need Congress' buy-in to [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1565.92s)]
*  completely eliminate the Department of Education blot. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1570.88s)]
*  William, James, we're just showing some images coming into us of Linda McMahon there testifying [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1573.7600000000002s)]
*  before the Senate. And I'm told that the stern and angry man with the furrowed brow behind her [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1581.44s)]
*  is a WWE wrestler, Triple H. So I expect to see some body slams. If she doesn't get [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1588.8000000000002s)]
*  confirmed, you can see her just tossing Chuck Grassley around the place like a rag doll, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1596.72s)]
*  because he's like 90. So let me ask you about this, Judge, William James, yesterday, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1602.56s)]
*  that rule that the president's buy-out offers for federal employees can now proceed. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1609.76s)]
*  What do we know about that? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1613.68s)]
*  Yeah, a federal judge essentially is allowing this to proceed, saying the unions that represented [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1616.08s)]
*  government workers didn't have the proper standing to sue in this case and to stop [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1623.04s)]
*  the buyout offer that the Trump administration has offered to millions of federal workers. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1628.8799999999999s)]
*  Now, we do know we had an updated number. We got that number from the White House this morning. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1634.0s)]
*  Some 75,000 workers have taken the federal government up on its buyout or deferred [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1638.8799999999999s)]
*  retirement or however you want to put it. This buyout offer, that will last until September. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1645.52s)]
*  Now, these government employees, they won't have to work. But it's also important to point out [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1650.48s)]
*  that funding for the government expires mid-next month. So the funding hasn't necessarily been [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1656.64s)]
*  appropriated to go towards the end of the fiscal year, which is when these terminations, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1662.24s)]
*  these deferred terminations were set to take place. But still nonetheless, the Trump administration [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1667.2s)]
*  is full steam ahead with reducing the size of the federal government, not only with those efforts [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1672.08s)]
*  focused partly on reducing spending with the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1677.6s)]
*  but also to cut the federal workforce. And in fact, some workers at the Department of Education, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1682.6399999999999s)]
*  a source familiar, have received those letters informing them that their positions have been [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1688.48s)]
*  eliminated. This is of course on top of those buyout offers that were offered to federal [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1693.9199999999998s)]
*  employees. All right. Willie James, thank you, Willie James. Let's turn now to the situation [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1699.36s)]
*  in the Middle East. This morning, Hamas says it will release the next group of Israeli hostages, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1706.24s)]
*  as planned this weekend. The militant group previously had threatened to delay the release, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1710.0s)]
*  accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire deal and threatening to bring the agreement [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1714.0s)]
*  crashing down. CBS News foreign correspondent Chris Livesey is following the very latest for [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1718.4s)]
*  us from Tel Aviv. So Chris, fast moving developments out of the region this morning. The question, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1722.8s)]
*  of course, is will Hamas react to President Trump's statement that they need to release [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1729.92s)]
*  all of the hostages this weekend? Apparently that's not happening. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1735.6s)]
*  You know, it's a very good question and one that I don't think anyone really knows the answer to. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1741.84s)]
*  But for now, they've said that they're going to at least release the three hostages that had been [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1746.8799999999999s)]
*  agreed to previously in this ceasefire. And if you'll remember, that ceasefire was pushed [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1752.08s)]
*  through by Donald Trump even before he had become president, even before he'd returned to the Oval [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1757.6s)]
*  Office. He tweeted out or posted on X that there would be hell to pay or all hell would break loose, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1763.68s)]
*  something along those lines, if the hostages weren't released by the time he came to office. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1769.76s)]
*  And so this stalemate of a situation, this deal that had been stuck since May, all of a sudden [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1774.0800000000002s)]
*  we started to see movement on it. That is until earlier this week when Hamas said no, because [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1779.52s)]
*  Israel allegedly had breached some of the terms of that agreement. Hamas said that Israel wasn't [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1785.1200000000001s)]
*  giving enough aid to Gaza and also wasn't allowing enough Gazans to return to their home. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1792.16s)]
*  So they said that effectively their terms, you know, the release of hostages was going to end [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1798.5600000000002s)]
*  this coming weekend. Trump again threatened that all hell would break loose if the hostages weren't [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1804.5600000000002s)]
*  released. So we're starting to see a pattern here. We're also starting to see Israel take a cue. We [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1810.72s)]
*  saw first Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeat that exact same language, then his defense [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1816.0s)]
*  minister repeated the same language. He's actually right now convening a meeting with [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1821.68s)]
*  the Southern Command. That's the military of Israel that's around and inside of Gaza as we [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1826.88s)]
*  speak. So we still don't have clarity from Israel exactly what they're going to do. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1833.1200000000001s)]
*  But for the time being, at least, Hamas says it's going to live up to its side of the bargain. Also [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1837.92s)]
*  Israel, according to our CBS Gaza team on the ground, they say that Israel has already brought [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1842.96s)]
*  in 150 trucks overnight and those trucks were packed with aid and they committed to bring in [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1848.16s)]
*  mobile housing units. So the signs seem to indicate that the deal is going to hold, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1853.44s)]
*  but we won't know until Saturday when Hamas is supposed to release the next three hostages. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1859.76s)]
*  And Chris, before I let you go, it's been a couple of days since President Trump talked about [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1864.96s)]
*  turning Gaza, the Gaza Strip, into nice beachfront property and even saying [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1869.68s)]
*  Palestinians would not have the right to be there. We're talking about two million people [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1874.64s)]
*  that would have to be displaced if the president were to actually move forward with his plans. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1880.08s)]
*  Any reaction, he talks about all hell breaking loose. When you look at the scenes across Gaza, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1884.96s)]
*  it seems as if hell has already broken loose. And yet we show images of Hamas fighters. Those [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1889.84s)]
*  images could have come from a year ago or five years ago. They're still there. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1895.84s)]
*  They are indeed still there. And that is a sticking point for Israel, for instance. There's [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1899.2s)]
*  no way that Israel is going to end this war, they say, so long as Hamas is still in charge. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1906.56s)]
*  The reaction on the ground is that, by and large, most Palestinians who we've spoken to vis-a-vis our [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1914.8s)]
*  Gaza team that's on the ground there, most people do not want to go nowhere. They want to stay in [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1921.8400000000001s)]
*  Gaza. They've told us that they're going to pitch tents, do whatever they can to stick around. But [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1927.92s)]
*  we don't get the impression from neither Israel or from the Trump administration that their [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1934.16s)]
*  opinion is being listened to. All right. Chris Lipsay for us live in Tel Aviv this evening for us. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1938.24s)]
*  Thank you, Chris. All right. Back to weather now. We have storms hitting both sides of the country. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1943.92s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Grant Gilmore with another look at the national [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1949.28s)]
*  forecast. Hey, Grant. Hey, Vlad. Look, it's crazy how active this pattern has been across the entire [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1953.2s)]
*  country. We just talked a moment ago about the active weather. One storm system exits to the [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1958.72s)]
*  east. Another storm system is rolling in from the west and then right in the middle of the United [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1964.16s)]
*  States. You've got some of the coldest air that we've seen this winter. Maybe not so much for the [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1968.24s)]
*  northern tier states, but still you've got 10 to 20 degrees below zero actual temperatures, even [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1973.1200000000001s)]
*  in portions of Colorado. You're talking about single digit temperatures right now. Denver [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1979.36s)]
*  at seven degrees. It's very cold, but the storm system just continued to move in. Let me pull up [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1983.84s)]
*  the northern hemisphere so you can really get a good look at this next atmospheric river that's [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1991.28s)]
*  moving into the west coast here. You've got all the specific moisture that's being concentrated [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=1996.9599999999998s)]
*  with that low pressure system that's moving ashore and will continue to move across not just the west, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2002.24s)]
*  but it'll move across the entire country as we head through the weekend. So a lot to track here [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2007.6s)]
*  as we make our way through the second half of the week into the weekend where again, it's not just [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2012.9599999999998s)]
*  winter weather, but it's also severe weather. We'll start with the atmospheric river inundating the [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2017.9199999999998s)]
*  west coast. You've got two to four feet of snow in the higher elevation. Some places could see [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2023.6s)]
*  between three to 10 inches of rain, so flooding obviously a concern, especially down towards the [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2028.48s)]
*  LA fire burn scars. And then you have severe weather on tap as we go into the weekend. This [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2034.96s)]
*  is the Storm Prediction Center's convective outlook for severe weather going into Saturday, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2040.24s)]
*  an enhanced risk for severe weather, damaging winds, tornado all in the card from Louisiana, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2044.8s)]
*  Mississippi into Alabama. Watch this here as we put the forecast into motion as we make our way [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2049.52s)]
*  through Saturday into Sunday. You've got severe weather to the south. You've got winter weather [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2055.12s)]
*  to the north. That moves to the east as we go into Sunday. And then here we go, another system [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2059.92s)]
*  moves into the west coast. This pattern looks to continue, Vlad, as we head into the second half [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2065.44s)]
*  of February. Back to you. All right, Grant, thank you. Coming up, a rare look inside one of [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2070.16s)]
*  El Salvador's most secure prisons, home to some of the country's most dangerous killers, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2074.8s)]
*  as the U.S. considers sending deportees to El Salvador. You're streaming CBS News 24-7. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2078.88s)]
*  All right, we're watching these three hearings on Capitol Hill. The full Senate is voting on RFK [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2083.6s)]
*  Jr.'s nomination to run HHS. Linda McMahon has her hearing for Education Secretary. And we are [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2092.88s)]
*  waiting to see if Cash Patel's nomination for FBI director will be advanced. We're going to obviously [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2098.08s)]
*  have a lot more on these hearings throughout the course of the day. So stick around for that. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2103.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, last week, El Salvador's president told Secretary of State Marco Rubio his country [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2106.96s)]
*  would incarcerate deportees from the United States. Well, this morning we are getting a rare [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2112.32s)]
*  look at the country's prison system. CBS News correspondent Lili Luciano traveled to El Salvador [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2116.56s)]
*  and got extraordinary access to a prison housing some of the country's most dangerous criminals. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2122.2400000000002s)]
*  Is it possible to get a tattoo like this if you're not a gang member? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2130.32s)]
*  No, you gotta kill. You gotta kill to get those tattoos. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2134.7200000000003s)]
*  How do you feel right now? Gotta recognize that what happened to us is like that titanic, that we were [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2142.7200000000003s)]
*  big and strong gangs, but we got hit with the iceberg. Are you gonna be here the rest of your life? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2153.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, the rest of my life. We murdered a lot of people and this is the consequence of what we did [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2159.92s)]
*  one day. How do you stay sane? How do you keep your head above water? Like try to act strongly [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2164.56s)]
*  in the day and cry in the nighttime. You cry at night? Yeah, because we know that we're not [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2172.08s)]
*  gonna get out of here. It's a maximum security prison. What was the gang that you were part of? MS-13. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2177.44s)]
*  And Lili Luciano joins us now. So, Lili, this is incredible access that you received to this [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2189.84s)]
*  prison. First of all, let's talk about why you wanted to do the story. Oh, Vlad, this story goes [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2194.64s)]
*  back so many years. For years, I covered, as you know, the border even before joining CBS News, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2200.0s)]
*  and I remember so many stories of people who had suffered the most brutal extortion, kidnapping, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2205.6s)]
*  torture by these gangs, and suddenly I stopped meeting Salvadorans at the border. I mean, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2211.92s)]
*  the numbers dropped significantly. So, I started looking into what was happening beyond the border, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2217.36s)]
*  of course, learned a lot about the crackdown on these gangs by Nayib Bukele, the president of El [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2221.92s)]
*  Salvador. And so, for over a year and a half, I've been asking for access, both to interview the [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2227.28s)]
*  president, which I haven't been able to do, but also to this prison, because it is notorious. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2232.8s)]
*  It is also kind of, you know, the way I see it, it was very difficult to be there. It's gonna take me [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2237.36s)]
*  a while to process what I saw, but there's something that's very interesting, and it's like the, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2243.1200000000003s)]
*  almost like the branding, not of the people, but of the whole system. Nayib Bukele now is telling [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2248.0s)]
*  the U.S. offered Marco Rubio, our secretary of state, the possibility of deporting and outsourcing [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2253.92s)]
*  our detention system for criminal immigrants and people who have a criminal record, but also even [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2261.36s)]
*  to U.S. citizens in our prison system. So, he's been very adamant to show this system to the world, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2267.6800000000003s)]
*  and being in there, you kind of get a really interesting look at the message that is being [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2274.96s)]
*  We were able to crack down on these gangs. We were able to solve the issue of organized crime [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2280.7999999999997s)]
*  that is usually controlled from prisons all throughout the region and throughout the world, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2286.56s)]
*  but at what cost? And that's something else that I'm looking into in this story that we're [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2291.3599999999997s)]
*  presenting tomorrow on The Evening News. So, the idea would be that migrants and undocumented [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2296.48s)]
*  immigrants here in the United States who have broken laws, who are criminals, right? We're [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2303.52s)]
*  talking about hardcore criminals. We're not talking about a mom and a child. That's the [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2307.04s)]
*  question that I have. That's the question. Bukele said people with convictions, including U.S. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2311.12s)]
*  citizens, of course there are legal issues with that. There are constitutional issues. Both Marco [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2315.36s)]
*  Rubio and President Trump have noted that. But when we look at what does it mean to break the law, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2319.92s)]
*  this prison, yes, it is filled with the most dangerous gang members, many of them, most of [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2326.96s)]
*  them, according to some experts, although the data is not transparent, is not available, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2333.28s)]
*  were imprisoned even before Bukele's crackdown, before his state of exception. We also looked into [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2337.44s)]
*  the state of exception. I did a patrol with their secretary of defense who is armed walking around [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2342.7200000000003s)]
*  the streets, and people come up and hug him and say, hey, thank you for what you've done, but at [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2349.44s)]
*  the same time you ask, wait, so who has been detained under this state of exception? And human [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2353.1200000000003s)]
*  rights organizations that used to help the people who were victimized by the gangs are now helping [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2358.24s)]
*  people who they say are being persecuted by the state. They tell you that the 84,000 people who [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2364.16s)]
*  have been detained under this state of exception that gives a lot of power to police and a few [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2369.68s)]
*  rights to people are mostly not the people that we see in Secote, but everyday people with very [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2374.3199999999997s)]
*  little evidence of any gang connection. Wow, powerful reporting, Lillia. You always do incredible [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2380.4799999999996s)]
*  reporting, but I think that this piece will have an impact on people's understanding of what [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2386.64s)]
*  President Trump is seeking to do and what some other world leaders, presidents of other countries [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2391.6s)]
*  have done and what that means just constitutionally speaking for their own citizens. Those collaborations [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2398.08s)]
*  between us and the region. Also, Bukele is trying to bring more investment into his country, which [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2403.36s)]
*  is a whole other conversation. Can't wait to see it. Thank you, Lillia, as always. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2408.72s)]
*  Folks, we're going to see much more of her reporting tomorrow night on the CBS Evening News, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2412.64s)]
*  so stick around for that. Meanwhile, for us, much more news ahead, you're streaming CBS News 24-7. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2416.16s)]
*  Taking you back now to Capitol Hill, where the Senate is voting on the confirmation of [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2425.92s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for Health and Human Services Secretary. It is one of three [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2429.6s)]
*  confirmation hearings that are happening on the Hill right now, and we're watching all three of [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2434.3199999999997s)]
*  them right here on CBS News 24-7. So let's bring back CBS News congressional correspondent, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2438.72s)]
*  Caitlin Huey-Burns. So what are you hearing, Caitlin? Hey, Vlad. Well, right now the Senate [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2443.12s)]
*  is voting on the confirmation, the full confirmation of RFK Jr. to lead Health and Human Services. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2448.7999999999997s)]
*  He is expected to be confirmed. We have seen some of the holdouts, like Lisa Murkowski, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2455.9199999999996s)]
*  that moderate Republican senator who we are always wondering which way she's going to go. She has [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2461.6s)]
*  said that she will vote for his confirmation. So we're watching that closely on the Senate floor [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2466.72s)]
*  to see if there are any Republicans that we don't know about who are going to vote against him. But [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2472.0s)]
*  at this point, he appears to be headed to full confirmation. Vlad, this is very significant [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2476.8799999999997s)]
*  because this was one of Trump's most controversial choices for his cabinet. You had several [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2482.8799999999997s)]
*  lawmakers, including Republicans, who had raised concerns about his positions, past statements, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2489.12s)]
*  questioning the efficacy of vaccines. Lisa Murkowski, Senator Cassidy, who we've talked [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2494.56s)]
*  about before, who had raised concerns about this, say that they have assurances from Kennedy that he [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2500.48s)]
*  is not going to discourage vaccination efforts. So they have kind of laid down the marker of Vlad [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2507.52s)]
*  to say, look, this is what he has promised us. And we are telling you, the American people, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2513.04s)]
*  that we are going to keep on him to make sure that happens. We'll see what happens there. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2517.44s)]
*  You also have a lot of other activity here on Capitol Hill when it comes to Trump's picks for [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2522.56s)]
*  his cabinet. Cash Patel, his choice to lead the FBI, is expected to come out of the committee vote. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2527.36s)]
*  That means the committee of jurisdiction over him is expected shortly to vote him. And you see that [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2535.2799999999997s)]
*  on your screen there. Vote him out of committee and on to full Senate confirmation there. Another [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2540.16s)]
*  one of the controversial picks. But so far, we haven't seen any Republican voice opposition [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2546.24s)]
*  to him. So that's significant. You also have here on Capitol Hill, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2550.88s)]
*  Lynda McMahon, Trump's choice to lead the Department of Education. She's just starting [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2554.1600000000003s)]
*  her confirmation hearing process. So it'll be a while before we see an actual confirmation for [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2559.52s)]
*  her. But this is significant because Elon Musk has already talked about slashing funds for the [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2564.96s)]
*  Education Department. And Trump has said on the campaign trail he wants to get rid of it altogether. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2569.52s)]
*  So we'll see what happens there. All right, Caitlin, breaking it all down for us on the hill. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2573.52s)]
*  Thank you as always, friend. Let's check in on those two powerful storm systems that are [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2578.48s)]
*  threatening both the East and West Coast. CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Grant [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2584.48s)]
*  Gilmore is back with the final look at the National Forecast Grant. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2587.6s)]
*  Hey, Vlad, I'll tell you what. The active weather pattern is going to continue. Like you said, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXttA9YdwVA&t=2592.72s)]
