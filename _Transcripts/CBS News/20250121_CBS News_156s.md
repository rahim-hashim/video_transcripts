# Senators receive affidavit with new allegations about Pete Hegseth
**CBS News:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro)
*  I want to bring in Torian Small from Capitol Hill because today, this afternoon, an affidavit [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=0.0s)]
*  was presented to the Senate Armed Services Committee regarding someone with information [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=6.68s)]
*  that she believed was pertinent to the pending confirmation of Pete Hegseth as this nation's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=11.44s)]
*  next defense secretary. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=17.32s)]
*  Torian, please let us know what you've learned. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=19.04s)]
*  Yeah, Major, that someone is Danielle Hegseth. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=21.52s)]
*  That's the former wife of Pete Hegseth's brother. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=24.78s)]
*  So this in-law coming forward with this information that she's purporting to be pretty damaging. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=29.02s)]
*  She and this affidavit laid out instances of her perceived or perception of abuse from [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=34.019999999999996s)]
*  him to his wife at the time, Samantha Hegseth, and also instances of public drunkenness. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=40.64s)]
*  She said in this, during the period of 2014 to 2016, she experienced some pretty significant [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=47.260000000000005s)]
*  incidents or was told about some significant incidents from her sister, his then wife, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=54.04s)]
*  now ex-wife. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=60.76s)]
*  Throughout this affidavit, she laid out exactly why she didn't believe that he is best fit [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  for this, and she said she also came to the FBI to give the same statement in confidentiality. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=66.88s)]
*  The question is, though, Major, why she's coming forward now with this information. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=73.2s)]
*  Well, two answers to that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=77.28s)]
*  The first one is, again, she went back already to the FBI to lay this out. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=78.9s)]
*  She had concerns about whether or not she could not only get a copy of her testimony, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=83.11999999999999s)]
*  but that would be made public. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=87.32s)]
*  The second answer is, this came as a response to a request from the top Democrat on the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=88.88s)]
*  Senate Armed Services Committee. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=94.56s)]
*  That's Jack Reed. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=96.78s)]
*  He had some pretty big concerns about this process moving forward and being fast-tracked [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=97.78s)]
*  by Republicans during his confirmation hearing, Pete Hegseth's confirmation hearing. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=103.39999999999999s)]
*  He said that he doesn't believe that the FBI did its due diligence and that this investigation [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=108.74000000000001s)]
*  was exhaustive in all these allegations and claims made to Hegseth. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=113.74000000000001s)]
*  Now, I should say that Hegseth's attorney did respond to this, saying that this is essentially [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=118.94000000000001s)]
*  a disgruntled ex-family member who has an ax to grind with Hegseth and the Hegseth family. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=124.30000000000001s)]
*  He said in part, quote, that Danielle is a far-left anti-Trump Democrat who was divorced [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=130.10000000000002s)]
*  from Mr. Hegseth's brother. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=136.44s)]
*  So again, he's maintaining that he did not do any of these things that she's claiming [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=138.64s)]
*  and is maintaining his innocence against any accusations of misconduct or abuse. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  Torian Small on Capitol Hill, thank you for that important update. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=152.11999999999998s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5IJ2g98ro&t=155.32s)]
