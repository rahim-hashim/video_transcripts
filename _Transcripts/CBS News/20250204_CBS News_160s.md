# What to expect from Trump meeting with Netanyahu as fragile Gaza ceasefire continues
**CBS News:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U)
*  For more on President Trump's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, I want to bring in CBS News foreign correspondent Chris Livesey [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=0.0s)]
*  Alright Chris [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=6.88s)]
*  So one of the things that I think will be very interesting is what Israel is especially looking to get out of this visit [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Given that this fragile ceasefire between the Israelis and Hamas is holding firm as of now [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=14.08s)]
*  but as you know Chris, there's been a [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=20.7s)]
*  What people are calling a fedpocalypse here in in the United States specifically in Washington as the Trump administration [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=24.64s)]
*  Looks to do things very very differently than has been done in years past and I wonder how that will play out [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=32.44s)]
*  diplomatically during this meeting [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=37.84s)]
*  Yeah, well it's indeed a very very fragile ceasefire [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=41.08s)]
*  I think the thing that the Netanyahu administration is trying to get out of this meeting more than anything else is pressure on [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=44.24s)]
*  Hamas to release [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  More of the of the hostages and to you know, keep this ceasefire going [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=52.76s)]
*  Remember that before Donald Trump even took office [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=58.16s)]
*  he came out with that threat to you know, all hell break loose if [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  If there weren't hostages released before he came into office and now here we are [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=66.48s)]
*  He's in office and we're seeing those hostages starting to come out in exchange for Palestinian prisoners now bear in mind [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  That took months and months of negotiations on the part of the Biden administration [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=78.96s)]
*  But it had also stalled for months and months [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=83.8s)]
*  So the Netanyahu team is trying to get as much as it possibly can out of that support [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=87.24s)]
*  from President Trump [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=94.32s)]
*  All right, so Hamas Chris as you know says that talks on negotiating the second phase of the ceasefire deal have now begun [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=97.36s)]
*  What are some of the hurdles that both sides are going to need to overcome to keep this deal going? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=105.8s)]
*  There are a lot of hurdles so just to name a few Hamas wants a permanent ceasefire [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=111.8s)]
*  They don't want the temporary pause that we're witnessing right now. They want guarantees that Israel won't restart military operations [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=116.8s)]
*  However, Israel doesn't want to agree to that unless Hamas is completely [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  Dismantled Israel also wants to keep security control [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=128.92s)]
*  Even if there's a ceasefire Israel wants to make sure Hamas doesn't rear me that means maintaining military oversight [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=131.92s)]
*  Which Hamas and its allies reject and finally who governs Gaza after the war? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=137.6s)]
*  There is still no clear plan for what happens next Israel definitely doesn't want Hamas in power [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=142.92s)]
*  But they also don't have an alternative government ready to take over [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=148.72s)]
*  All right, Chris live safe for us in Tel Aviv Chris, thank you very much appreciate it [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOzkkotW0U&t=155.12s)]
