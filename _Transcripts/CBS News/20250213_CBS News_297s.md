# Details on suspected Munich car ramming; Hegseth says U.S. hasn't betrayed Ukraine
**CBS News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ)
*  Police in Munich have arrested a suspect accused of driving into a union demonstration injuring dozens of people. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=0.0s)]
*  The suspected attack happened just hours before Vice President JD Vance arrived in Munich to discuss the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=7.0s)]
*  So I want to bring in CBS News foreign correspondent Holly Williams to talk a little bit more about this. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=13.0s)]
*  Holly, what do we know about this incident? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=17.0s)]
*  Good morning, Vlad. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=20.0s)]
*  Well, German police say that at least 28 people were injured, including some children, some people seriously, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=21.0s)]
*  after that man drove his car into a crowd at around 1030 this morning local time at a square near downtown Munich. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=27.0s)]
*  As you know, world leaders are gathering in Munich today ahead of a security conference tomorrow, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=34.0s)]
*  including Vice President JD Vance and Ukraine's President Vladimir Zelensky. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=40.0s)]
*  The police say that they fired a shot at the car and then detained the driver, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=44.0s)]
*  who they say is believed to be a 24-year-old asylum seeker from Afghanistan. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=49.0s)]
*  Now, the governor of that region, Bavaria, said that the incident is suspected to have been an attack. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=55.0s)]
*  The crowd was gathered there for a protest organized by a union. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=61.0s)]
*  Now, Germany goes to the polls for a national election in just over a week. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=65.0s)]
*  Immigration is already a key issue, and this incident will likely play into that at that national election. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=70.0s)]
*  Wow. All right. We'll be tracking that throughout the next couple of days, Holly. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=79.0s)]
*  Let's pivot to a discussion that we started yesterday about Ukraine. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=83.0s)]
*  As you know, President Trump spoke with both Vladimir Putin and President Zelensky of Ukraine this morning. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=87.0s)]
*  He posted that he feels that a deal can be reached to stop the war. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=93.0s)]
*  As you can imagine, there is mixed reaction to this. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=97.0s)]
*  First, I want to play, Holly, for you sound from the former ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=99.0s)]
*  Listen to what he had to say. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=105.0s)]
*  I think there is a real possibility. I think there is a real possibility. All sides want it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=106.0s)]
*  The Russians are hurting. They need to stop this war. They've got incredible economic problems. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=111.0s)]
*  The Ukrainians obviously want to stop this war, and Europeans do, and the United States does. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=117.0s)]
*  So, yes, I think there's a real possibility this war could end this year. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=122.0s)]
*  All right. So folks want the war to end. That's clear. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=125.0s)]
*  But Holly, this is a post from former National Security Advisor John Bolton, and it says in part, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=129.0s)]
*  I saw another post from Ambassador Bolton, Holly, where he said [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=134.0s)]
*  that the Kremlin is drinking vodka straight from the bottle. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=137.0s)]
*  After hearing that, he said, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=141.0s)]
*  loss of their territory and NATO security guarantees or membership. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=144.0s)]
*  By making these and other concessions before negotiations even started, Trump has effectively [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=148.12s)]
*  surrendered to Putin on Ukraine. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=152.76s)]
*  I saw another post from Ambassador Bolton Holly where he said that the Kremlin is drinking [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=155.24s)]
*  vodka straight from the bottle after hearing from President Trump yesterday. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=161.48s)]
*  What are you hearing from your sources on the ground about this? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=166.36s)]
*  Well, look, President Trump sounded very positive, didn't he, after that phone call with Putin [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=169.04s)]
*  The Kremlin said that the phone call lasted nearly one and a half hours. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  I think here's the problem for Ukrainians. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  What kind of ceasefire will Trump and Putin negotiate and will it actually bring a lasting [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=180.0s)]
*  peace to Ukraine? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=186.44s)]
*  I mean, yesterday, the Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegs, said that while the U.S. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  supports an independent Ukraine, it does not support NATO membership for Ukraine with all [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=191.92s)]
*  the security guarantees that that would bring. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=197.0s)]
*  In the U.S., he said, would not contribute soldiers to any international peacekeeping [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  force in Ukraine. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=203.64s)]
*  And he also said that returning Ukraine to its pre-2014 borders was, quote, unrealistic. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=205.0s)]
*  So as a result, some Ukrainians fear that a ceasefire negotiated by President Trump [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=211.44s)]
*  could involve handing over part of their country, part of their territory to Russia without [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  the security guarantees they want to stop Vladimir Putin reinvading, doing it all over [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=221.24s)]
*  again in a few years' time. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=227.18s)]
*  If that happened, it would be it would effectively be a huge victory for Vladimir Putin. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=229.12s)]
*  It would reward him for invading Ukraine and igniting a war that has killed hundreds of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=235.44s)]
*  not killed, but caused hundreds of thousands of casualties on both sides. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  Vlad. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=245.6s)]
*  Really quickly before you go, and I know this is happening in real time because the news [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=246.6s)]
*  is still just breaking. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=250.28s)]
*  But has there been any reaction from Brussels? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=252.56s)]
*  I've seen some statements from European leaders that anything that happens with regards to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=254.92s)]
*  ultimately a deal happening between Ukraine and Russia, the Europeans would have to be [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=259.96s)]
*  involved and be supportive of it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=264.2s)]
*  So what are you hearing from on that front? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=266.0s)]
*  So, look, the Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegs, had said yesterday that Europe needs to do [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=267.64s)]
*  more for European security. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  And we've heard the same thing from European defense ministers, that Europe should do more, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=273.88s)]
*  that Europe should step up its efforts. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=277.96s)]
*  But in an interview, a recent interview by Ukraine's President Vladimir Zelensky, he [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=280.76s)]
*  said that any security guarantees for Ukraine need to include the United States. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=285.2s)]
*  All right, Holly Williams, with that deep analysis for us this morning. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=292.44s)]
*  Holly, I appreciate you so much. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMADIfsK6CQ&t=296.8s)]
