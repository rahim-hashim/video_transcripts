# Trump says workers who don't reply to OPM email will eventually lose jobs
**CBS News:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU)
*  Welcome back. As federal workers try to work through what feels to them like a confusing atmosphere [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=0.0s)]
*  about job cuts and demands from the Department of Government Efficiency, otherwise known as DOGE, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=6.0s)]
*  the man wants to have to be sort of a co-captain of that agency. Well, yesterday he announced he's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=10.96s)]
*  running for governor of Ohio. Vivek Ramaswamy declared his candidacy yesterday. Very soon [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=16.72s)]
*  thereafter, both President Trump and Elon Musk endorsed Ramaswamy. Let's bring in our political [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=21.84s)]
*  panel. Eliza Acevedo, formerly served as director of communications for former second gentleman Doug [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=26.88s)]
*  Emhoff. Lance Trover, spokesperson for the 2024 presidential campaign of then governor, now interior [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=32.64s)]
*  secretary Doug Burgum. It's both great to have you both here. I want to play for you some sound [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=39.44s)]
*  from the Oval Office from just a little bit ago. President Trump making it clear that this email [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=44.4s)]
*  that went out about your five things I accomplished last week and the possible implications of it [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=49.28s)]
*  is not a brand new thing. They've been thinking about it for a while. Let's listen. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=55.04s)]
*  In some cases, they're not writing back. And if they don't write back, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=59.36s)]
*  they end up eventually losing their job. We give them extensions, but you know, that was something [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=64.0s)]
*  we thought about a long time ago. We give them extensions, but we'll see. We thought about a long [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=69.28s)]
*  time ago. So Lance, this looks like another effort to cull the federal workforce and at least be able [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=74.48s)]
*  to blame those in the federal workforce who don't respond for their own termination, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=81.36s)]
*  self-imposed termination, probably the president will describe it as. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=87.76s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, I think there have been a few missteps along the way, but if you look at the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=91.2s)]
*  broader effort of Doge, and we saw the Harvard poll that came out yesterday and we saw 72% of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=95.76s)]
*  the country is on board with the idea of Doge and something like this. So I don't think in terms of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=99.84s)]
*  like what's going on, we have a fun time discussing what's going on here in Washington. And it's a [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  little confusing for the federal workers. I think publicly, if we're looking at the broader [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=108.88s)]
*  spectrum of the American public, they're not really worried about the details and getting into it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=112.24s)]
*  They just like the fact to see that something is actually going on. We're getting the government [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=115.6s)]
*  reduced. Liza, the Republican governor of Virginia has said we need to do something about our federal [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=118.56s)]
*  workforce. He's put up a website to offer ideas about how to gussy up your resume, find job [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=127.36s)]
*  linkages. Other House Republicans have said words like there needs to be more compassion, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  needs to be more empathy, more order to pick up Lance's point of view. How do you evaluate [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=140.96s)]
*  the politics of this so far? Yes, there's a Harvard poll, but Lance, as you well know, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  there are other polls that are not as robustly thumbs up as the Harvard poll. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=150.08s)]
*  Well, I'll just call it like I see it. He's playing both sides of the fence. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=154.56s)]
*  That is to say the president. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=158.08s)]
*  The president and the governor of Virginia, the governor of Virginia went out and he said publicly, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=159.76s)]
*  well, there are going to be some losses. There are going to be some cuts that are made. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=164.8s)]
*  I support Elon Musk's efforts and I support Donald Trump's efforts. They need to continue [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  moving forward. Then he goes ahead and he launches this website. He is playing [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  both sides of the fence. Let me tell you something. I've spoken to federal employees inside the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  government right now. Morale is completely low. People are considering applying for new jobs [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=180.08s)]
*  because of the current situation that's taking place. You are seeing the reaction from [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=185.84s)]
*  individuals. You're seeing these Republican town halls. You're seeing people are showing up [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=190.56s)]
*  and they're furious. I read somewhere the other day that there was an IRS worker who voted for [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=194.48s)]
*  Donald Trump and now he's out of a job. So this is having real life implications on people. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=198.64s)]
*  And Lance, your former boss when he was a candidate, now he's the interior secretary. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  Have you had any conversations with him about the effect this easer is inhabiting [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=209.28s)]
*  on the interior department? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, no, I'm not going to talk about conversations I have with the interior secretary. I'll let him [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=214.32s)]
*  speak for himself when it comes to all that stuff. But on to your point about Glenn Lunkin, I mean, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=218.72s)]
*  he would also be criticized as the governor of that state if he weren't doing something [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=222.32s)]
*  to help out people who were getting, you know, let go as well. I just want to flag that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=225.92s)]
*  If he weren't doing it, the Democrats will be all over him for not doing anything. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=230.48s)]
*  What do you think, to your point a moment ago, Lance, about the bottom line trickle-down effects [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=234.16s)]
*  of this are politically? Because 80% of the federal workforce does not live in Washington, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=239.28s)]
*  D.C., Virginia or Maryland. There are about five million federal contractors who are not part of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  the federal workforce, but they're recipients of federal grant money in one way or another. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=250.72s)]
*  And they're distributed all over the country in Trump states and in Harris states. Do you think [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=255.76s)]
*  there are any potential downstream negative consequences of this government drawdown of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=260.48s)]
*  the federal workforce or contractors? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=265.92s)]
*  Yeah, look, you would call me crazy if I didn't sit here and say yes. Is there potential down [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=268.0s)]
*  the road for that to happen? Of course, that's the potential to happen. But if you're the Trump [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=272.56s)]
*  administration, you have to move fast and you have to move hard. You have to do what Elon Musk says. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=276.64s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to break things. But if we find things that shouldn't be broken, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=280.16s)]
*  we're going to fix them. And that's kind of how they're operating. But I don't see any other way [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=283.04s)]
*  for them to operate because the slower you go, the more this bureaucracy will slow them down even [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  further. The courts are going to decide a lot of this. And I think that's what the Trump they [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=291.92s)]
*  understand that. So I think for them, it's like they know they're not going to get everything, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=296.48s)]
*  but you've got to go hard and fast and get what you can get now and see how it shakes out in the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=300.32000000000005s)]
*  end. Liza, I am by several orders of magnitude the oldest person at this table. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  I remember reinventing government. I covered it when I covered Capitol Hill when Bill Clinton and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=310.16s)]
*  Vice President Gore were in charge of the federal bureaucracy. And over a six-year period, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=315.20000000000005s)]
*  lots of people associated with reinventing government would tell you they trim the federal [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=319.52000000000004s)]
*  workforce over six years by 600,000 employees. It can be done and done in a way that re-imagines [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  what is the necessary size of the federal workforce. If they can cut 600,000, why can't [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=332.96s)]
*  Trump cut 100,000? Oh, they can absolutely make cuts, right? But it's going, it's the way that you [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=340.23999999999995s)]
*  do it that matters. And it's about just, you know, do you send a notice to somebody and say in 24 [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=345.2s)]
*  hours, you're going to be laid off and not have a job anymore? Or do you go about it a different [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  way? Right? And I think, again, you're seeing people are getting very, very frustrated with [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=354.32s)]
*  exactly how the Trump administration is performing right now. And let me be very clear. The [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=358.48s)]
*  Republicans have a slim majority in the House. And I think they need to be very careful with the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=364.32s)]
*  actions that they're taking when it comes to the midterms. And to that point, Lance, one of the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=369.04s)]
*  things that those who remember that period of time will tell you is there was a process. They [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=373.12s)]
*  went to Congress and that's how this thing stuck. That's how the things that the Clinton administration [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=378.24s)]
*  set in motion actually lasted and weren't tripped up by legal challenges. Shouldn't the White House [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=382.56s)]
*  do that? Well, again, I mean, you make a good point. I mean, the House has a one seat majority. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=387.12s)]
*  But again, I think you have a very different view of presidential authority that Donald Trump has [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=391.52s)]
*  versus the Clinton administration. And so they're going to be- Much more expansive. Yeah, it [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=395.44s)]
*  absolutely is more expansive. And that's how Donald Trump has always been from his first [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=398.88s)]
*  term in office to where he is now. And I think he feels empowered to step forward because of [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=402.08s)]
*  his big win in November. Liza Acevedo, Lance Trovers, that's, you see your Lance, your Liza. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=406.4s)]
*  And we both work for Doug's. That's right. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=413.2s)]
*  Look, I can only take so much. I can only take so much. Great to have you Liza. Thanks very much. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=416.56s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioPGWYRUsjU&t=420.0s)]
