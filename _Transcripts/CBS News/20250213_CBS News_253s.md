# Latest news on Trump's reciprocal tariffs
**CBS News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ)
*  President Trump says he's going to announce so-called reciprocal tariffs on every country [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=0.0s)]
*  with duties placed on the U.S. If in his words, they charge us, we'll charge them. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=6.72s)]
*  That announcement is set to come right before a key meeting between President Trump and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Indian Prime Minister Modi, the leader of a country Trump calls, quote, the tariff king. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=17.44s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News Money Watch correspondent Kelly O'Grady. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  She joins us live. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=26.32s)]
*  Kelly, thank you for being here. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=27.32s)]
*  So go over this again. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=29.08s)]
*  What are reciprocal tariffs and how would they work? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  OK, so think of it as a tit for tat retaliation when it comes to tariffs. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=34.04s)]
*  Remember, a tariff is a tax that a company will pay when it's importing goods from another [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=41.64s)]
*  country. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=47.72s)]
*  So in this case, countries like India, like Vietnam, like Thailand, they put a tax on [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=48.72s)]
*  U.S. goods that are being imported into their country by companies in that country. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=55.68s)]
*  And so the reciprocal element here is President Trump is saying, well, if you're going to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=61.92s)]
*  tax the U.S. goods that are coming into your country, we are going to tax your goods that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=67.4s)]
*  are coming into our country. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=73.32s)]
*  So that's where that retaliation, the reciprocal aspect, it is a specific type of retaliation. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=75.5s)]
*  That means if you're taxing 10 percent, we're also going to tax 10 percent. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=82.56s)]
*  So it's kind of that evening out of things. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=86.64s)]
*  The countries that this is going to hit hardest would be countries like India, like Vietnam [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=88.96s)]
*  and a lot of developing nations, a lot of nations in Southeast Asia and Africa utilize [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  tariffs in order to protect their domestic industries. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=100.96s)]
*  So that's kind of basically what it is. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=104.97999999999999s)]
*  Sure, what it's going to mean is likely higher prices for us because that tax that a company [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=107.64s)]
*  would be paying often gets passed down to the consumer. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=112.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=115.48s)]
*  So this is a really important meeting between Trump and India's prime minister in just a [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=116.48s)]
*  few hours. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=119.74s)]
*  So what goods do we exchange with India and what might Trump's tariff threats mean for [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  trade? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=126.44s)]
*  You are absolutely right. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=129.32s)]
*  This is a critical meeting. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=130.32s)]
*  It's probably no surprise that this is being announced right now because we do know that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=132.04s)]
*  President Trump utilizes tariffs as a negotiating tactic. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  So our trade relationship with India for context, we are their biggest trading partner. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=140.6s)]
*  They are in our top 10. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=146.04s)]
*  So we are important to each other, but we are more important to India than they are [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=147.6s)]
*  to us. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=151.23999999999998s)]
*  The types of goods that we sell to India are pharmaceuticals, petroleum, the types of goods [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  we buy from India. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=157.32s)]
*  Think textiles, spices, a lot of pearls as well coming from there. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=158.83999999999997s)]
*  There is a trade deficit. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=164.48s)]
*  That means that we buy more goods from India than we sell to them in India's favor. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=166.23999999999998s)]
*  But yes, this is going to be a very important meeting. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=173.16s)]
*  India has already indicated that they will roll back some of those tariffs. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=175.56s)]
*  So I'm sure this is going to be something that the two presidents are talking about. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=178.83999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting to watch because during Trump's first administration, these two had [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=182.32s)]
*  a very warm relationship. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  So it'll be interesting to see what comes out of this particular meeting during this [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=187.83999999999997s)]
*  current administration. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=190.94s)]
*  There's new data on inflation, though, trickling in, switching gears. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=193.08s)]
*  The producer price index report. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  Tell our viewers, what is the PPI and what do we learn from this? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=199.72000000000003s)]
*  So this measures the prices, the costs that it costs producers in order to make the goods [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=205.52s)]
*  that we then go buy at the retail store, at the grocery store. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=212.32000000000002s)]
*  And so this is really important because when these prices rise, it trickles down to us [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=217.9s)]
*  the consumers eventually. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=222.94000000000003s)]
*  Remember, we also got an inflation reading yesterday, but it was the consumer prices index. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=224.38000000000002s)]
*  What is driving this? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=230.42000000000002s)]
*  Diesel fuel prices are up as our travel accommodation services. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=232.22000000000003s)]
*  So think businesses like restaurants, hotels, those types of things. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=237.82000000000002s)]
*  But yes, this came in hotter or higher than expected. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=242.5s)]
*  We like to use the word hotter in economics. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=246.06s)]
*  Certainly wasn't good news. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=249.02s)]
*  All right, Kelly O'Grady. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=250.02s)]
*  Thank you so much for that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pVsJezb3KQ&t=251.82s)]
