**CBS News:** [March 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I)
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says it's important that Ukraine's plight is heard and not forgotten. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=0.0s)]
*  He made those comments on social media today, a day after his explosive Oval Office meeting with President Donald Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=6.08s)]
*  What was supposed to be a show of diplomacy ended with what some are calling a debacle and without a rare minerals deal. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=14.88s)]
*  European leaders are rallying behind Zelensky and vowing unwavering support after his early White House exit following the contentious meeting. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=21.6s)]
*  President Trump said Zelensky can return to the White House when he's ready for peace. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=29.92s)]
*  Willie James Inman is in West Palm Beach with more. Willie, good morning. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=34.96s)]
*  Good morning to you, Dana. President Trump and President Zelensky were set to sign an agreement that would have given the U.S. access to rare earth minerals from Ukraine. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=41.92s)]
*  They were also preparing to discuss a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia. But now the path forward is unclear. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  What started out as a pleasant meeting at the White House ended in a tense war of words. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=60.72s)]
*  Right now you don't have your playing cards. You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. You're gambling with World War III. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=67.12s)]
*  And with the Ukrainian president being kicked out of the White House. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=76.08s)]
*  The meeting took a turn after Vice President J.D. Vance praised President Trump for working to bring a diplomatic end to the conflict. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=80.4s)]
*  And President Zelensky responded with a history lesson on how Russia violated previous agreements. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=87.6s)]
*  And we signed with him, me, like a new president in 2019. I signed with him the deal. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=93.84s)]
*  I signed with him, Macron and Merkel. We signed ceasefire. But after that he broken the ceasefire. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=101.6s)]
*  He killed our people and he didn't exchange prisoners. We signed the exchange of prisoners. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=109.68s)]
*  But he didn't do it. What kind of diplomacy, J.D., you are speaking about? What do you mean? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=115.52s)]
*  I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  Yes, but if you are not strong... [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=126.72s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=127.44s)]
*  Both Trump and Vance then accused Zelensky of being ungrateful. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=134.48s)]
*  But you don't have the cards. But once we sign that deal, you're in a much better position. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=138.96s)]
*  But you're not acting at all thankful. And that's not a nice thing. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=144.24s)]
*  A planned lunch and press conference was scrapped. President Trump posted on True Social saying [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=147.84s)]
*  Zelensky is not ready for peace if America is involved. In his own post, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  Zelensky thanked the president, Congress and Americans for their support. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=158.88s)]
*  They should have an immediate ceasefire. That was the other thing. He didn't want to do about [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=162.96s)]
*  ceasefire. A ceasefire could take place immediately. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=166.88s)]
*  Lawmakers, including Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, usually a fierce supporter of Ukraine, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=170.32s)]
*  blasted Zelensky. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=175.76s)]
*  We want to be helpful. What I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=177.6s)]
*  And I don't know if we can ever do business with Zelensky again. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  Democrats blamed Trump and Vance. With Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer posting, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=186.88s)]
*  Trump and Vance are doing Putin's dirty work. Senate Democrats will never stop [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=192.88s)]
*  fighting for freedom and democracy. When asked in a Fox News interview if he owed Trump an apology, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=197.44s)]
*  Zelensky said no and added, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=204.0s)]
*  This is not good for both sides anyway. And I will, I will very open, but I can't, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=206.4s)]
*  you know, change our Ukrainian attitude to Russia. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  U.S. assistance to Ukraine could now be in jeopardy following this contentious meeting. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=218.08s)]
*  President Trump has the authority to give nearly $4 billion in military assistance to Ukraine [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=224.88000000000002s)]
*  without congressional approval. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGa61g5lU8I&t=230.88000000000002s)]
