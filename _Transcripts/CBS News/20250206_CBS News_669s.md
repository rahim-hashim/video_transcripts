# Latest news on federal worker buyout proposal, Trump's shocking Gaza plans
**CBS News:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls)
*  And we start in Washington as federal workers inch closer to the White House deadline to accept a proposed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=0.0s)]
*  Resignation offer the Trump administration gave employees until tonight to make that decision [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  This comes as President Donald Trump continues to push for cutbacks within federal government agencies rather through his [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=13.52s)]
*  Department of government efficiency if workers accept the offer they would be excused from working [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=20.96s)]
*  But will continue to get paid at least [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=27.16s)]
*  40,000 workers have accepted the deal, but we expect that number to climb as we get closer to the deadline [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=30.28s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News White House reporter Olivia Rinaldi for more on this Olivia [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=37.08s)]
*  We know this deal has not been finalized and Congress warns these payouts are not even in the budget [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=42.44s)]
*  So what happens if workers do not resign by tonight? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  Amiga it's good to be with you time is really ticking for federal workers to decide whether or not they're gonna take that [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=52.16s)]
*  Proposed buyout we know the Office of Personnel Management gave them until this evening to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=58.279999999999994s)]
*  Make that decision as you mentioned we have reported that about 40,000 [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=64.24s)]
*  Federal workers have already taken that proposed buyout [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=69.44s)]
*  That's a drop in the bucket for about the two million federal workers that there are in the US government [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=73.0s)]
*  But it's still a very significant number [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=78.56s)]
*  We do expect that number to rise especially today as we know workers are getting emails that tonight is the final deadline to decide [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=81.0s)]
*  Whether or not they're going to take that proposed buyout [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=88.0s)]
*  But as you mentioned there's already legal challenges around it federal labor unions have been pushing back around the legality of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=90.0s)]
*  Even taking this proposed buyout and Congress has only funded the government through March 14th [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=97.76s)]
*  So Congress hasn't even agreed upon paying for some of these buyouts a lot of questions surrounding [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=104.16s)]
*  What this is actually gonna look like going forward as we're just hours away from when that deadline is set to take effect [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=110.08s)]
*  And President Trump is now back at the White House Olivia after speaking at the National Prayer Breakfast [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=116.24s)]
*  Breakfast rather on Capitol Hill earlier today. He announced two executive orders there. So what else came out from his remarks? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=122.28s)]
*  Another very notable thing that I found today from Trump's remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=129.36s)]
*  Was he made this announcement about air traffic control systems in the u.s. Specifically [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=133.68s)]
*  He said he's going to ask Congress to fund a new air traffic control system completely brand new [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=138.56s)]
*  And he would like that to be a single standalone bill take a listen to what he had to say specifically about that this morning [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=144.96s)]
*  I think what is going to happen is that the president has been asking Congress to fund a new air traffic control system [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=151.28000000000003s)]
*  And what's going to happen is we're all going to sit down and do a great [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=159.36s)]
*  Computerized system for our control towers [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=163.68s)]
*  Brand new not pieced together obsolete like it is land based [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  Trying to hook up a land based system to a satellite system [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=172.08s)]
*  We spent billions and billions of dollars trying to renovate an old broken system instead of just saying cut it loose [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=175.84s)]
*  And let's spend less money and build a great system [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=182.96s)]
*  Done by two or three companies very good company specialists. That's all it is [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=186.8s)]
*  Now he's not exactly wrong in saying that the air traffic control system [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=195.84s)]
*  Is outdated one source told me that in some of those towers across the country [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=199.36s)]
*  They still use floppy disks to update their information systems [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=203.68s)]
*  They also use these paper strips and that's how they decide which plane is flying when they kind of line them up [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=207.12s)]
*  So when he's talking about bringing this together and updating the system [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=212.72s)]
*  This is something that advocates in the airline industry have been pushing for for a very very long time [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=215.68s)]
*  But of course getting congress involved asking for senator john thune and senator chuck schumer [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  And speaker johnson to all get on the same page about what this looks like in a single standalone bill [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=226.56s)]
*  It's not going to be the easiest thing to get accomplished [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=231.68s)]
*  Yeah, definitely doesn't seem like it's going to be what else is on schedule for president trump today, olivia [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=234.24s)]
*  Well, he's also going to be meeting with some of those house republicans that I just mentioned including speaker johnson talking about something very similar [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=238.96s)]
*  But also different that they can't get on the same page about and that's the congressional budget. What are trump's top priorities? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  He's been meeting with these house republicans at mar-a-lago even before he took the oath of office [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=250.56s)]
*  Throughout january he was meeting with them now that he's in office has met with them several times about what the legislative priorities are for this white house [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=255.84s)]
*  And what they can actually do is they can actually get a lot of information from the president [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=261.12s)]
*  About what the legislative priorities are for this white house [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=264.56s)]
*  What they can actually accomplish with some of these bills that they would like to put forward [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=268.08000000000004s)]
*  We know that some members of the senate including lindsay graham are already moving forward [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=271.6s)]
*  With doing markup on some of the appropriations bills that they would like to see [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=275.52000000000004s)]
*  But it's still house republicans that trump is trying to get in line with and figure out what are the priorities [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=280.0s)]
*  What would they like to see in the next couple of months as he says he wants to see some legislation signed [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=284.24s)]
*  Within the next couple of months [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=289.04s)]
*  Okay, olivia rinaldi, thank you so much for your time today [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=291.44s)]
*  Turning now to our nation's capital and a look inside the room where israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu meets face to face [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=295.12s)]
*  With a group of bipartisan lawmakers up next on his list house speaker mike johnson all of this is happening [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=302.88s)]
*  While president trump continues to float a u.s. Takeover of the gaza strip [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=310.24s)]
*  He doubled down on that idea in this truth social post saying quote [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=315.12s)]
*  The gaza strip would be turned over to the united states by israel at the conclusion of fighting [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=320.0s)]
*  He went on to say the u.s. Would work with development teams from around the world to build one of the most spectacular [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  developments of its kind cbs news congressional reporter [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=334.06s)]
*  Torian small is live on the hill following all of this for us torian [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=337.52000000000004s)]
*  We know netanyahu is set to meet with speaker mike johnson today [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=341.52s)]
*  But do we know how that meeting with senate majority leader john flun went? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  So mugo thun or any of the bipartisan senators that was a part of that group [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=351.76s)]
*  Who met with netanyahu who have yet to comment on? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  Their discussions, but I will say though that democrats in that room are expected to press this [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=361.44s)]
*  israeli leader [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=367.84s)]
*  On exactly how trump's plan to occupy gaza would actually work now the white house has maintained that this will not take military force [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=369.2s)]
*  I will say though a reporter in the room during the photo spray [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  Asked outright whether or not it would require u.s troops for a plan like that to happen [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  Netanyahu answered succinctly with the no, so that's going to be something we're chasing throughout the day as we're hearing more [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  From senators coming out of that meeting muga [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=396.08s)]
*  All right. Well wait and see what we get from that and torian [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=398.56s)]
*  Let's talk about the senate now. They've been in session all night democrats [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=401.84000000000003s)]
*  They are keeping their promise of holding the floor in protest [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=405.36s)]
*  Of russell votes nomination to lead the office of management and budget. Is that still going on and when could we see vote? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=409.20000000000005s)]
*  Finally cross the finish line [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=416.88s)]
*  Yeah, mugo they're holding the line through a process known as a debate they could do up to 30 hours of debate [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=420.88s)]
*  Which is what we're seeing [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=428.0s)]
*  I recall the days when democrats did protest on the senate floor with pillows saying they would sleep overnight [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=429.2s)]
*  This is something that we've seen happen before but here though their real reservations is [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=435.6s)]
*  Kind of two-fold here one because they feel as trump's next budget chief [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=441.52s)]
*  he would give unfettered access vote would give unfettered access to the president to [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=445.36s)]
*  Dismantle in their mind the federal government as they see happening now [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=451.02s)]
*  And the second is because of his association with project 2025 that's the conservative manifesto by the heritage foundation [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=455.44s)]
*  They don't like his ties to that either and they feel that they shouldn't give access [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=462.88s)]
*  Or or grant the confirmation of someone who was previously connected to what democrats saw as a boogeyman during the presidential election cycle [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=467.2s)]
*  Well, I mentioned though. I should mention rather the fact that I haven't seen much republican pushback to votes nomination [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=475.76s)]
*  Considering the fact that republicans have the majority if four senators don't defect [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=482.5s)]
*  It's likely that we'll see him be confirmed sooner than later and as early as 7 p.m. Tonight [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=488.18s)]
*  Okay, and torian speaking of democrats some of them are expressing concern about elon musk and the department of government efficiency [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=494.9s)]
*  Here's an ex-post from senator chris van holland. He says quote hearing reports that musk's cronies are targeting the national [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=502.9s)]
*  Oceanic and atmospheric administration. So what more can you tell us about this? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=511.29999999999995s)]
*  Yes, so according to democrats on capitol hill and sources familiar to cbs news [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=518.5s)]
*  We're hearing that members of the department of government of efficiency or doge [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=524.8199999999999s)]
*  Entered the offices of noaa in maryland [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=530.1s)]
*  And then also their dc office here were told by former former employees of noaa [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=533.96s)]
*  That staff have been told they should expect up to 50 percent cuts in staffing or in headcount and around 30 percent in budget [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=541.64s)]
*  Cut slashes across the board. This is in line what we've been seeing so far from [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=549.4s)]
*  This government entity ran by elon musk [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=554.6800000000001s)]
*  The idea here is cuts across the board in order to get through those policy proposals that could be costly [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=558.0400000000001s)]
*  And they're looking at what they're calling efficiency or lack of efficiency in some of these departments [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=564.28s)]
*  But as you know as we've talked about from democrats before they feel that one elon shouldn't be attached to this and two [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=569.64s)]
*  That they're overreaching and when it comes to the purse that is a power that lies solely within congress not within [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=576.2s)]
*  The executive branch of the president [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=584.0400000000001s)]
*  Okay, torian, I also want to ask you here about lawmakers [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=586.1999999999999s)]
*  They're planning to introduce a bill today that will ban the deep seek app from government devices [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=589.56s)]
*  And they cite security concerns that the app could provide user information to china [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=595.0s)]
*  So just real quick remind us what deep seek is and this seems pretty similar to the whole tiktok situation [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=600.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, eerily similar in fact the congressman josh grotheimer who [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=608.4399999999999s)]
*  Authored the bill to ban tiktok which ultimately took effect [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=613.2399999999999s)]
*  signed into law by [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=618.52s)]
*  President biden at the time and then we saw tiktok go dark for 24 hours [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=619.8s)]
*  Is also behind legislation to ban this app. This is an ai chat bot similar to that of chat gbt [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=624.5999999999999s)]
*  The difference here though is that it's ran by and owned by a chinese-based company [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=632.04s)]
*  They don't like they being lawmakers don't like the fact that data connected to this could be fed directly to the chinese government [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=637.08s)]
*  Which is why they're having pause and they're going forward with this legislation [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=644.6s)]
*  I will also say though that other countries have taken the lead on banning this app in those countries including south korea [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=647.4s)]
*  So it wouldn't be the u.s taking a stand first [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=655.4s)]
*  But they're certainly look for that as looking at that as precedent for any action they take here on the hill [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=657.8s)]
*  Okay, that's a very important context to have there. Thank you so much tori and small for your time today [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3uoRDcYOls&t=662.84s)]
