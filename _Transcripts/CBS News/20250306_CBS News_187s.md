# House censures Rep. Al Green for disrupting Trump address to Congress
**CBS News:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw)
*  And we have some breaking news this hour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=0.0s)]
*  Congressman Al Green has just been censured by the House of Representatives. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=5.92s)]
*  Let's bring back congressional correspondent Nicole Killian, who's live for us at Capitol [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=9.96s)]
*  Hill this morning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=14.52s)]
*  Nicole, tell us more about what just happened. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=15.52s)]
*  Yeah, well, as you mentioned, Texas Congressman Al Green was censured by the House, 10 Democrats, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=17.52s)]
*  cross-party lines to support this censured measure. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  This is more or less a slap on the wrist for Congressman Green, who told reporters after [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=27.56s)]
*  leaving the House floor Tuesday night that he was willing to take whatever punishment [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=34.16s)]
*  he ultimately may receive. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=38.68s)]
*  Now we know that punishment being censured. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=41.16s)]
*  So it is a mark on his record, but obviously he still is part of the House of Representatives. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  So beyond just the stain of having censure on your record, if you will, there really [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=50.32s)]
*  is no further penalty beyond that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=56.6s)]
*  But what I will say in talking to Congressman Al Green just yesterday about this, you know, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=59.72s)]
*  I asked him if this was a planned protest on his part or if he just responded in the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=64.4s)]
*  moment. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=70.52000000000001s)]
*  And he told me it was pure spontaneity. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  He just felt that he needed to stand up, that he didn't agree with what the president was [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  saying. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=77.64s)]
*  And so that is how he wanted to express his disapproval. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=78.64s)]
*  Interestingly, I would note, Chanel, obviously the House is now in recess, but right after [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=82.0s)]
*  this censure vote took place, there were a number of members that surrounded Congressman [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  Al Green on the floor, some singing with him side by side. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=92.88s)]
*  But that moment then became contentious as the speaker adjourned the House. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=98.28s)]
*  And I'm told by one of our House producers that there has been some bickering between [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=103.96s)]
*  Republicans and Democrats about this demonstration by some House Democrats on the floor trying [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=108.48s)]
*  to show their support of Congressman Al Green. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=114.48s)]
*  So the drama continues. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=117.4s)]
*  Yeah, Nicole, and I just wonder what this says or means for what's acceptable on the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=119.36s)]
*  House floor in terms of tone and tenure during what is such a divisive time in American [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=124.36s)]
*  history. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  And obviously, you know, here on Capitol Hill, there is a sense and expectation of decorum. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  But as we know, our politics has become very polarized in this country. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  And here in Congress, it is no different. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=146.83999999999997s)]
*  And so emotions continue to be very raw and have been this way for some time now. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=150.04s)]
*  You know, I would say certainly we saw right after January 6th. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=156.92s)]
*  That was a very divisive moment for many lawmakers, a traumatic moment, but one that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=161.38s)]
*  did polarize lawmakers further. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=166.98s)]
*  And of course, now in light of the second Trump administration, that has also divided [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=169.06s)]
*  Republicans and Democrats a bit more. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=175.01999999999998s)]
*  And so that's why you're seeing kind of some of these emotions just coming out in full [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=177.68s)]
*  display. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=182.34s)]
*  A fiery moment for sure. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=183.5s)]
*  Nicole Kellyanne, thank you. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=184.66s)]
*  You bet. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KMzmGBfLTw&t=185.94s)]
