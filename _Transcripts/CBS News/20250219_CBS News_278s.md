# Trump slams Zelenskyy as U.S. envoy arrives in Ukraine after Russia peace talks
**CBS News:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo)
*  So right off the top, escalating tensions between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=0.0s)]
*  President Volodymyr Zelensky. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=5.44s)]
*  The two leaders sparring today, Mr. Zelensky accusing Donald Trump of living in a Russian [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=7.32s)]
*  disinformation space. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  He said that during a news conference in Kiev. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=14.52s)]
*  Just moments ago, Mr. Trump slammed Zelensky back in a lengthy social media post. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Trump saying in part, quote, a dictator without elections, Zelensky better move fast or he [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=21.84s)]
*  is not going to have a country left. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=27.48s)]
*  In the meantime, the president goes on to say we are successfully negotiating an end [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=29.8s)]
*  to the war with Russia. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  Something I'll admit only Trump and the Trump administration can do. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=35.56s)]
*  Close quote there from the president's social media. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=39.68s)]
*  So let's go live to CBS News White House reporter Aaron Navarro. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=42.800000000000004s)]
*  Aaron, the president posting this while the US has an envoy in place to have talks in [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=45.88s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  What are the implications overseas? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  Reid, that's right. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  Keith Kellogg is supposed to meet with President Zelensky in Kiev today. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=56.56s)]
*  And just to point out more of Trump's post where he called Zelensky a quote, moderate [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=60.92s)]
*  modestly successful comedian. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=65.92s)]
*  He really criticized the fact that Ukraine has received billions of dollars of aid from [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=68.28s)]
*  the United States. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=72.84s)]
*  And in recent weeks, Trump has questioned that saying what is the US getting in return [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=73.84s)]
*  for giving them that aid? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=78.88s)]
*  He also pointed to the fact that he believes that there should be an election to replace [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  Zelensky, citing low polling numbers for Zelensky, though some of the other polls show him hovering [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=85.72s)]
*  right around 50 percent. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=90.24s)]
*  Lately Trump has been critical of Zelensky and yesterday talking to reporters here in [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=93.6s)]
*  Florida, he seemed to put blame on Ukraine for not yet brokering a deal that would let [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=97.88s)]
*  them retain quote most of their land. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=102.64s)]
*  All of this notable too as Ukraine was kind of left off the table when it comes to Russian [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=105.6s)]
*  officials and US officials meeting in Saudi Arabia yesterday to talk about an end to this [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=112.68s)]
*  war. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=117.84s)]
*  Hi, Aaron. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=118.84s)]
*  So I want to switch gears here because a lot of people are talking about it today. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=119.84s)]
*  President Trump, Elon Musk, the two faced questions on the role of Mr. Musk's Department [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=122.92s)]
*  of Government Efficiency during a prerecorded interview with Sean Hannity last night. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=126.92s)]
*  Want to play that for our viewers to see a portion of it and then we'll talk about it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=131.88s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, the overall goal is to try to get a trillion dollars out of the deficit. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  If the deficit is not brought under control, America will go bankrupt. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=141.56s)]
*  This is a very important thing for people to understand. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=145.32s)]
*  True, true. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=147.28s)]
*  Yeah, we inherited. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=148.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=149.28s)]
*  And inflation is back. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=150.28s)]
*  I'm only here for two and a half weeks. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=151.28s)]
*  That was January. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=152.88s)]
*  You were there for a week. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=153.88s)]
*  Don't think of it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=154.88s)]
*  Inflation's back. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=155.88s)]
*  And they said, oh, Trump, in fact, I had nothing to do with it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=156.88s)]
*  These people have run the country. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  They spent money like nobody's ever spent. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=161.6s)]
*  So for those who have expressed that they don't really have a stomach for the power [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=165.28s)]
*  that Elon Musk has been granted by the president, the president sort of stuck his foot in the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=169.04s)]
*  door and said the buck stops with him. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=172.8s)]
*  Aaron. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=174.44s)]
*  Yeah, President Trump really portrayed Elon Musk as an enforcer of his some of his executive [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=177.16s)]
*  orders, such as eliminating the programs from certain federal agencies. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=182.08s)]
*  He pointed to Elon Musk and what he's doing with Doge and identifying potential cuts as [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=186.28s)]
*  the ones actually carrying out the spirit and mission of his executive orders. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=191.44s)]
*  Because I also thought it was notable how Elon Musk said, quote, some of those employees [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=195.96s)]
*  affiliated with Doge are paid by the federal government, are considered federal employees. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=200.68s)]
*  Hannity in their interview noted that Elon Musk himself is not paid for his work with [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=206.32s)]
*  Doge. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=210.4s)]
*  But the fact that he said some raises questions about who else may not be technically employed [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=211.4s)]
*  by the federal government, but are still working with or in Doge. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=216.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=220.36s)]
*  And what kind of access they have, that is being challenged in courts as well. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=221.36s)]
*  So the president in Miami today, not far from where you join us live. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=224.96s)]
*  What are the meetings about there in South Florida? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=229.08s)]
*  Yeah, President Trump left from here to Miami this morning. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=233.12s)]
*  This is a two day conference being ran by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, something [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=236.96s)]
*  that usually attended by presidents. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=240.56s)]
*  But Trump is going to be continuing his courting of the Saudis here and notable given his son, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=242.76000000000002s)]
*  Jared Kushner's investments in the country. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=248.36s)]
*  This is also notable because just yesterday Trump officials and Russian officials met [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=252.16s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia to talk about ending the Russian invasion in Ukraine. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=256.24s)]
*  You've heard Trump officials say that Saudi Arabia is a key partner as they're trying [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=260.16s)]
*  to negotiate and end to this war. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=265.4s)]
*  Certainly going to be watching to see if there's any further developments in Trump's conversations [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=267.96s)]
*  in Miami today. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=272.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=273.72s)]
*  We'll be watching and we know you'll have it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=274.72s)]
*  Aaron Navarro, thank you so much for that conversation. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwcMGHKYWCo&t=275.88s)]
