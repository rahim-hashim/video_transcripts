# Highlights from Tulsi Gabbard and Kash Patel's confirmation hearings
**CBS News:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE)
*  This is, I believe, a live look at Capitol Hill for you this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=0.0s)]
*  You got three of President Trump's more controversial nominees for top government positions being [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=2.92s)]
*  grilled yesterday during their confirmation hearings. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=7.8s)]
*  And that included Trump's pick for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=11.16s)]
*  to oversee national intelligence, and Cash Patel for FBI director. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=15.84s)]
*  All three defended past controversial statements. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=20.6s)]
*  It's not an enemy's list. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=24.92s)]
*  That is a total mischaracterization. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=26.48s)]
*  I want to make certain that in no way does Russia get a pass in either your mind or your heart. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=28.88s)]
*  I'm offended by the question. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  If you show me data, I will be the first person to assure the American people that they need [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=38.76s)]
*  to take those vaccines. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=45.8s)]
*  For more on the hearings, I'm joined by CBS News congressional correspondent, Caitlin [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=48.44s)]
*  Huey-Burns. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=51.44s)]
*  Caitlin, good morning to you. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=52.44s)]
*  I want to start by speaking about Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  She seemed to dodge questions about the man accused of being the largest intelligence [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=56.72s)]
*  leaker in U.S. history. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=61.08s)]
*  Let's quickly play that clip for our viewers. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=63.2s)]
*  Is Edward Snowden a traitor to the United States of America? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=65.92s)]
*  That is not a hard question to answer when the stakes are this high. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=71.52s)]
*  Senator, as someone who has served in uniform. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=77.12s)]
*  Yes or no, is Edward Snowden a traitor to the United States of America? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=80.72s)]
*  As someone who has worn our uniform. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=88.32s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=92.32s)]
*  How is Gabbard's response or non-response likely to impact her prospects? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=93.32s)]
*  Yeah, that was such an interesting exchange, Errol. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=98.32s)]
*  And she was also pressed by some Republicans on that same question. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=101.92s)]
*  A conservative Republican was asking the same question. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=107.68s)]
*  Yes or no, do you believe that Snowden was a traitor? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=110.84s)]
*  And what was significant here is that she dodged the question saying, well, he broke [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=114.44s)]
*  the law. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=118.72s)]
*  And then she eventually said that what came of this, though, was an exposure of what she [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  called unconstitutional practices that were later reformed. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  What's significant about this, two things to keep in mind. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, as director of national intelligence, this is a huge issue. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=133.96s)]
*  Second, she really doesn't have any wiggle room here. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=138.4s)]
*  If just one Republican on that committee votes against her in the committee, that will sink [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=142.60000000000002s)]
*  her chances. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=148.12s)]
*  She's unlikely to be able to move forward after that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=149.12s)]
*  So it was just telling to see not only Democrats that you saw Michael Bennett there, but also [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=153.36s)]
*  Republicans have those same concerns. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=157.36s)]
*  And some of them coming out of the committee weren't exactly persuaded by her answers. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=159.92s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=165.0s)]
*  And I'm curious what stood out to you from Cash Patel's hearing as well. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=166.0s)]
*  I saw some Democrats pressing him on Trump's pardoning of January 6th defendants. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Errol, I think that was the biggest moment of that hearing. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=175.64s)]
*  He actually broke with Trump and said that he doesn't agree about those pardons for those [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=180.0s)]
*  who assaulted police officers. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=185.64s)]
*  Remember, Patel is up to lead the FBI. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=187.84s)]
*  He would be the nation's top cop, essentially. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=190.24s)]
*  And so that was a telling moment, especially for Patel, Errol, because he is a Trump loyalist [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=193.8s)]
*  through and through. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=199.36s)]
*  He has been by his side, a top ally and a real firebrand. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=200.72s)]
*  Some controversial positions, but he's also pledged to reform the FBI. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  That's something especially appealing to Trump and the Republican Party base at this point. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  So to see that break there was notable. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  However, he really stuck to his alignment with the president. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=217.44s)]
*  For example, he refused to disavow Trump's false claims about the 2020 election, for example. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=222.16s)]
*  Patel has pretty much unified support from Republicans. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  He is very likely to get through. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=233.16s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, though, as I mentioned, faces that steeper climb. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=235.36s)]
*  All right, we'll continue to watch closely. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  CHP, thanks so much. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  Have a great weekend. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  You too, Errol. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llL9ikCVeFE&t=242.48000000000002s)]
