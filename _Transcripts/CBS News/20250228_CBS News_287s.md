# Trump meeting with Zelenskyy after calling him a dictator
**CBS News:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ)
*  About an hour away from the highly anticipated meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Zelensky and President Donald Trump, the leaders are expected to sign a deal to grant U.S. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=3.7s)]
*  access to Ukraine's rare minerals. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=8.44s)]
*  It's the first time they will face each other since a string of comments by Trump calling [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=10.84s)]
*  Zelensky a dictator. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  He also blamed him for a war that he actually didn't start because Vladimir Putin actually [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=17.04s)]
*  started it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=20.72s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Natalie Brand is live from the White House to break down what we [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=21.72s)]
*  can expect from this morning's meeting. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=25.32s)]
*  Natalie, you have a preview for us. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=28.76s)]
*  Good morning, Vlad. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and it was just a week ago that we were talking about this escalating public feud [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  between President Trump and Ukraine's President Zelensky. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  As you noted, the president here in the United States has blamed Ukraine for a prolonged [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=41.24s)]
*  war following Russia's invasion three years ago. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=47.24s)]
*  And yesterday, notably, the president ahead of this meeting tried to walk back a bit that [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=51.8s)]
*  dictator comment, questioning whether he said it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=56.96s)]
*  So that's where we start going into this meeting. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=61.08s)]
*  Of course, the Trump administration is pushing for a ceasefire peace deal between Russia [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=64.52s)]
*  and Ukraine, Ukraine for its part, of course, pushing for security guarantees to protect [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=70.5s)]
*  its its sovereignty and its land. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=76.0s)]
*  And it's very unclear at this point what that ultimate deal could look like. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=79.48s)]
*  Really, what's at stake today is this other agreement pertaining to rare earth minerals [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=84.4s)]
*  and trying to develop a partnership between the United States and Ukraine on that front. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=90.76s)]
*  Of course, we are talking about critical assets that are in everything from electronics to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=96.4s)]
*  military equipment, fighter jets. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=103.88s)]
*  So this is critical. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=106.4s)]
*  The White House believes for national security and the economy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=108.72s)]
*  So let's talk about that minerals deal. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=113.22s)]
*  What more can you tell me about that and why the U.S. is pursuing it? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=115.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=118.94s)]
*  Well, right now, China dominates the market when it comes to production and also processing [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=119.94s)]
*  of rare earth minerals. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=126.64s)]
*  It's estimated about 90 percent of the processing comes from China. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=128.18s)]
*  So the U.S., even going back to the Biden administration, has been trying to look for [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=131.9s)]
*  ways to bolster its own supply chain and diversify to try to reduce the reliance on China. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=135.98s)]
*  I talked to an expert from the Center for Strategic and International Studies about [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=143.38s)]
*  the strategy by the Trump administration. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=149.17999999999998s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=151.54s)]
*  The big challenge is that we only have about one point five percent of the world's rare [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=152.73999999999998s)]
*  earth. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=158.38s)]
*  So we source a lot of them from abroad. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=159.38s)]
*  The final agreement is essentially an establishment of a fund. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=160.7s)]
*  And the fund takes 50 percent of the revenue generated by future mineral assets and puts [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=165.06s)]
*  them into a fund that can be used to fund investment in Ukraine. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=172.78s)]
*  And Graceland Basker in there, she says what's important to note is mining takes time. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  It could take up to 20 years to develop a mine and then even determine whether it's [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=184.26000000000002s)]
*  fruitful and yields benefits. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=191.18s)]
*  So we still have a long way to go. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=193.26s)]
*  And obviously, another big question for private sector investment in this endeavor would be [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=194.98s)]
*  security and stability in the region. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=200.72s)]
*  Let me ask you something about this federal judge that has ruled that the mass firings [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=205.54s)]
*  by the administration of these probationary government workers is likely illegal. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=210.44s)]
*  So this is really kind of an interesting development here, Natalie. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=217.38s)]
*  Explain that to our audience. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=221.57999999999998s)]
*  A major development in a court ruling late last night out of San Francisco. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=223.02s)]
*  And it was a ruling from the bench. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=229.22000000000003s)]
*  So what we are still waiting to see is the details of this court order. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=231.34s)]
*  But we know that the judge in Northern California, the federal judge, as you noted, he ruled [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=236.34s)]
*  that the mass firings of these probationary employees was likely illegal. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=242.66000000000003s)]
*  And he granted some temporary relief. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=247.94s)]
*  But it really remains to be seen what that means for the probationary employees who were [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=251.26s)]
*  already terminated, the thousands of them. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=256.36s)]
*  I spoke to someone from one of the unions involved in filing this suit, and he said [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=259.28s)]
*  they're still eagerly awaiting the details of this, trying to sort through what it means [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=264.24s)]
*  in practice moving forward. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=269.38s)]
*  And also important to note that this was just the first phase of this. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=271.5s)]
*  There's another hearing scheduled next month to further hear this case. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=274.68s)]
*  So hopefully more details on the implications very soon. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=279.64s)]
*  All right, Natalie, always great to have you. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=284.36s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gy3-ewTrxQ&t=285.64s)]
