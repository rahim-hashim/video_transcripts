# More than 60 million facing severe weather threats across southern U.S.
**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y)
*  At this moment, more than 60 million Americans across the South are under this severe storm threat. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=0.0s)]
*  You've got a massive system sweeping all the way from Texas to the Atlantic, and it's expected to bring damaging winds and those ever dangerous tornadoes. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=6.0s)]
*  CBS News senior weather correspondent Rob Marciano is following all the latest for us from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=15.0s)]
*  Rob, it doesn't look too treacherous where you are now, but how bad will things get today? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=21.0s)]
*  Well, we're ahead of it right now, but it's already been bad in Dallas and North Texas with hundreds of thousands of people without power. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=28.0s)]
*  You showed that line across the border in Marshall County, Oklahoma. They've got 16 homes and two businesses there on Main Street damaged. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=35.0s)]
*  And Ada, Oklahoma, just southeast of Oklahoma City, reports of damage there with collapsed homes and businesses and even people potentially trapped. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=43.0s)]
*  So this is a dynamic system that's having some great impacts for life and property already this morning, and it's all moving off towards the east. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=52.0s)]
*  And we'll be getting it, I think, a little bit later on today. And if anything, Errol, it's going to be strengthening it as it does so. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=61.0s)]
*  And one of the things about this region of the country, you've got major transit arteries. I'm thinking of the I-10, for example. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=68.0s)]
*  So what can folks in the South expect over the next 24 to 48 hours? Because they'll be in the thick of it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=74.0s)]
*  They will be. Well, this line that's gone through Oklahoma and Texas is about to cross the Sabine and get into Arkansas and Louisiana. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=82.0s)]
*  And as it does so, it's starting. You see the winds kind of in my face here. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=91.0s)]
*  The south winds and southwest winds are beginning to pick up off the Gulf of Mexico, and that's going to increase. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=95.0s)]
*  That's kind of the lower level winds that kind of feed into spinning the air in the atmosphere. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=100.0s)]
*  And because of that, we think that some of these storms are going to have some rotation. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=105.0s)]
*  The potential for tornado is going to increase from Shreveport to Monroe, down here to Baton Rouge, down I-10 through New Orleans and Gulfport, Biloxi, potentially all the way to Mobile as we go through the later afternoons and evening hours tonight. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=110.0s)]
*  And then continuing overnight into Georgia and then the Carolinas tomorrow. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=124.0s)]
*  I think there'll be a similar threat there. All the while, the backside of this thing has got blizzard warnings up. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=128.0s)]
*  And we're looking for several inches of snow to fall in places like Omaha, Nebraska, and winds blowing 40, 50, maybe 60 miles an hour. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=134.0s)]
*  So even if you don't get a severe storm or a tornado coming to your area, this storm is going to be so big and expansive. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=141.0s)]
*  There's going to be some potentially wind damage for millions of Americans across especially the southeastern quadrant of the country. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=149.0s)]
*  Wow. A cold snap after this windy slap. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=155.0s)]
*  Rob Marciano, you and the crew stay safe. We appreciate your reporting. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=159.0s)]
*  Let's cross now to CBS News. Philadelphia meteorologist Grant Gilmore with a look at your national forecast. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=163.0s)]
*  And I see you've got it in highlight there, Grant. What should people expect? It looks to be quite dangerous. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=168.0s)]
*  Errol, the activity has really started to ramp up pretty much over the last couple of hours. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=176.0s)]
*  You heard Rob talking about an ongoing tornado warning taking right towards Shreveport right now. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=181.0s)]
*  All along that line, though, you've got severe winds in excess of 58 miles. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=185.0s)]
*  We've already seen some severe thunderstorm damage because of these severe storms moving through. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=190.0s)]
*  And we expect more as we go throughout the day. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=195.0s)]
*  You see that enhanced risk stretching from southern Arkansas, northern Louisiana, all the way along the northern Gulf states into the panhandle of Florida. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=197.0s)]
*  So that's today into the day tomorrow, though the threat continues. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=204.0s)]
*  But the focus is going to be on northern Louisiana into southern Mississippi and southwestern Alabama today for that threat for some strong tornadoes EF2 or stronger. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=207.0s)]
*  And then there's that severe threat extending through the Carolinas all the way up into the northeast as we go into the day tomorrow. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=217.0s)]
*  Like Rob said, this is a massive storm system with the winter side to the north that could drop up to 15 inches of snow before the system clears off the coast. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=223.0s)]
*  As we go into the second half of the week. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=233.0s)]
*  Back to you, Errol. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=235.0s)]
*  Wow, wow, wow. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=236.0s)]
*  Just have your battery powered radios ready just in case. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=237.0s)]
*  Grant Gilmore, thank you very much. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=240.0s)]
*  We'll see you again soon. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmg6PclQt-Y&t=242.0s)]
