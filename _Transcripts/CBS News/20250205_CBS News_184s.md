# At least 10 killed in mass shooting in Sweden
**CBS News:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs)
*  Right now we're following developments in Sweden where officials are trying to establish a motive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=0.0s)]
*  in what the country's prime minister calls the worst mass shooting in that country's history. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=4.88s)]
*  At least 10 people were killed in yesterday's attack at an adult education center. This is [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=10.4s)]
*  more than 100 miles west of Stockholm. Police say the gunman was also killed. For more on this, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  I'm joined by CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams in our London bureau. Holly, this is [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=21.36s)]
*  extremely rare for Sweden. What more do we know about what happened? Good morning, Errol. Well, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=26.0s)]
*  the attack occurred in the middle of the day around 12.30, as you said, at an adult education [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=32.24s)]
*  center in the town of Orebro, which is a small place, only has a population of around 100,000 [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=38.56s)]
*  people. That center helps adults study for high school diplomas, learn vocational skills and learn [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=44.24s)]
*  the Swedish language. And many of the students there were immigrants. The police say that along [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=50.4s)]
*  with those killed, six people were injured, including five who had surgery for gunshot wounds. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=56.4s)]
*  Yesterday they said that two of them were being treated in intensive care. And the police also [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=62.8s)]
*  say that there is evidence to suggest that the attacker shot himself. Now, the police say they [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=67.52s)]
*  have no evidence at this point of any ideological motive. They do say that the man appears to have [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=73.12s)]
*  acted alone. He had never been convicted of a crime and he was not known to the police [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=79.12s)]
*  until this incident. They still, they say they're still trying to figure out why he did this. In [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  fact, a day after the attack, we really know remarkably little about the attacker and what [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=91.36s)]
*  his motives were. According to Swedish media reports, which we can't independently confirm [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=97.28s)]
*  at this point, the attacker was aged around 35. He was unemployed. He was a recluse with little [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=102.24s)]
*  contact with his family and he did have a hunting license to own and use a gun. And Holly, it's just [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=109.28s)]
*  extremely, as unusual as it would be anywhere, extremely unusual in Sweden. How uncommon is this? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=117.52s)]
*  Well, look, you know, Europe has much lower rates of gun crime than the U.S. and much lower rates [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  of gun ownership. To give you some context on that, in a 2019 U.S. study found that the firearm [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=130.16s)]
*  homicide rate in the U.S. was 22 times higher than Europe as a whole. And when it comes to gun [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=138.16s)]
*  ownership, the U.S. has about 120 guns owned per 100 people, whereas in Sweden they have only about [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=145.28s)]
*  23 guns owned per 100 people. That is quite high, though, by European standards. And you must have [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=152.4s)]
*  a weapon license to own a gun. However, Sweden, which has a population of around 10 million people, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=160.0s)]
*  has had the highest per capita gun violence in the European Union in recent years. A lot of those [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=165.84s)]
*  incidents have been attributed to gang violence and shootings like this in schools remain extremely [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=172.4s)]
*  rare. Just a horrific tragedy. I know you'll continue to gather details. Holly, thank you. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNCMlBifaVs&t=179.2s)]
