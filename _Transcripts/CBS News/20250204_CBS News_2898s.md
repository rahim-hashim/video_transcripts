# Trump says U.S. will "take over the Gaza Strip" in presser with Netanyahu
**CBS News:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E)
*  All right, everybody, President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=0.0s)]
*  are holding a press conference at the White House. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=3.36s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=5.24s)]
*  That's a lot of press. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=6.24s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=12.16s)]
*  You bring them out. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=13.16s)]
*  You really bring them out. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=14.96s)]
*  Today I'm delighted to welcome Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu back to the White [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=17.68s)]
*  House. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=23.0s)]
*  It's a wonderful feeling and a wonderful event. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=24.0s)]
*  We had fantastic talks. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  And thank you very much with your staff. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=30.52s)]
*  He's the first foreign head of state to visit during our administration. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=34.0s)]
*  And Bibi, I want to say it's an honor to have you with us. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=38.04s)]
*  Over the past four years, the U.S. and the Israeli alliance has been tested more than [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  any time in history. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=49.8s)]
*  The bonds of friendship and affection between the American and Israeli people have endured [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=53.26s)]
*  for generations, and they are absolutely unbreakable. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=58.42s)]
*  They are unbreakable. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=61.660000000000004s)]
*  I'm confident that under our leadership, the cherished alliance between our two countries [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=64.18s)]
*  will soon be stronger than ever. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=69.06s)]
*  We had a great relationship. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=71.3s)]
*  We had great victories together four years ago. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=73.3s)]
*  Not so many victories over the past four years, however. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=76.74000000000001s)]
*  In my first term, Prime Minister and I forged a tremendously successful partnership that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=80.7s)]
*  brought peace and stability to the Middle East like it hadn't seen in decades. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=85.94s)]
*  Together we defeated ISIS. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=92.58s)]
*  We ended the disastrous Iran nuclear deal — one of the worst deals ever made, by the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=93.98s)]
*  way — and imposed the toughest ever sanctions on the Iranian regime. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=98.18s)]
*  We starved Hamas and Iran's other terrorist proxies, and we starved them like they had [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=104.06s)]
*  never seen before. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=111.10000000000001s)]
*  Resources and support disappeared for them. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=112.42s)]
*  I recognized Israel's capital, opened the American embassy in Jerusalem, and got it [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=116.10000000000001s)]
*  built, by the way. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=121.74000000000001s)]
*  Built it, too. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=123.22s)]
*  Just not only designated it, but got it built at a price that nobody's seen for 40 years. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=124.22s)]
*  We got it built. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=131.54s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=132.54s)]
*  It's a Jerusalem stone right from nearby, and it's something that's very special. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=133.62s)]
*  And recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights — something that they talked [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=139.22s)]
*  about for 70 years, and they weren't able to get it, and I got it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=144.94s)]
*  And with the historic Abraham Accords, something that was really an achievement that was, I [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=150.18s)]
*  think, going to become more and more important because we achieved the most significant Middle [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=156.18s)]
*  East peace agreements in half a century. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=160.98000000000002s)]
*  But the Abraham Accords in particular — and I really believe that many countries will [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=164.18s)]
*  soon be joining this amazing peace and economic development transaction. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=167.9s)]
*  It really is a big economic development transaction. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=173.34s)]
*  I think we're going to have a lot of people signing up very quickly. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=178.02s)]
*  Unfortunately, for four years, nobody signed up. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=180.54000000000002s)]
*  Nobody did anything for four years except in the negative. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=182.98000000000002s)]
*  Unfortunately, the weakness and incompetence of those years — those past four years, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=186.9s)]
*  the grave damage around the globe that was done, including in the Middle East, grave [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=192.7s)]
*  damage all over the globe. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=197.98s)]
*  The horrors of October 7th would never have happened if I were president. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=200.38s)]
*  The Ukraine and Russia disaster would never have happened if I were president. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=206.01999999999998s)]
*  Over the past 16 months, Israel has endured a sustained, aggressive, and murderous assault [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=211.85999999999999s)]
*  on every front, but they fought back bravely. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=218.14s)]
*  You see that and you know that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=221.01999999999998s)]
*  What we have witnessed is an all-out attack on the very existence of a Jewish state in [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=222.42s)]
*  the Jewish homeland. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=228.82s)]
*  The Israelis have stood strong and united in the face of an enemy that has kidnapped, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=231.0s)]
*  tortured, raped, and slaughtered innocent men, women, children, and even little babies. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=236.82s)]
*  I want to salute the Israeli people for meeting this trial with courage and determination [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=243.45999999999998s)]
*  and unflinching resolve. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=249.45999999999998s)]
*  They have been strong. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=251.38s)]
*  In our meetings today, the Prime Minister and I focused on the future, discussing how [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=253.82s)]
*  we can work together to ensure Hamas is eliminated and ultimately restore peace to a very troubled [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=258.53999999999996s)]
*  region. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=265.98s)]
*  It's been troubled, but what's happened in the last four years has not been good. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=266.98s)]
*  I want to thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for working closely with my transition team, the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=272.42s)]
*  special envoy Steve Witkoff, who's here somewhere. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=277.62s)]
*  Steve, stand up, Steve, please. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=282.02000000000004s)]
*  What a job you've done. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=284.70000000000005s)]

*  Social Security Advisor Mike Waltz, thank you Mike for working so well with us. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=291.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=296.54s)]
*  We have in addition Marco Rubio, who is on the phone right now listening to every single [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=298.78000000000003s)]
*  word that we say, and he's going to be great. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=306.54s)]

*  And Caroline's been doing a great job. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=314.54s)]
*  She's really probably talked about more than anybody here. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=318.06s)]
*  She's done a fantastic job. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=322.7s)]
*  And thank you very much, Caroline. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=323.7s)]
*  We're proud of you. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=324.7s)]
*  But we'll only be satisfied when all of these problems are solved and we have the team to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=326.26s)]
*  solve them and that's going to happen. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=332.05999999999995s)]
*  And it's going to happen, I think, very quickly. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=334.82s)]
*  I also strongly believe that the Gaza Strip, which has been a symbol of death and destruction [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=337.09999999999997s)]
*  for so many decades and so bad for the people anywhere near it, and especially those who [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=342.14s)]
*  live there and frankly, who's been really very unlucky. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=348.06s)]
*  It's been very unlucky. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=352.06s)]
*  It's been an unlucky place for a long time. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=353.06s)]
*  Being in its presence just has not been good and it should not go through a process of [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=356.1s)]
*  rebuilding and occupation by the same people that have really stood there and fought for [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=361.98s)]
*  it and lived there and died there and lived a miserable existence there. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=368.78s)]
*  Instead, we should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts and there [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=375.78000000000003s)]
*  are many of them that want to do this and build various domains that will ultimately [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=381.14000000000004s)]
*  be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=386.58000000000004s)]
*  and frankly, bad luck. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=393.54s)]
*  This can be paid for by neighboring countries of great wealth. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=396.18s)]
*  It could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=399.70000000000005s)]
*  It could be numerous sites or it could be one large site, but the people will be able [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=404.34s)]
*  to live in comfort and peace and we'll make sure something really spectacular is done. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=408.9s)]
*  They're going to have peace. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=416.09999999999997s)]
*  They're not going to be shot at and killed and destroyed like this civilization of wonderful [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=417.09999999999997s)]
*  people has had to endure. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=425.34s)]
*  The only reason the Palestinians want to go back to Gaza is they have no alternative. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=428.06s)]
*  It's right now a demolition site. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=434.9s)]
*  This is just a demolition site. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=436.54s)]
*  Virtually every building is down. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=438.58s)]
*  They're living under fallen concrete that's very dangerous and very precarious. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=440.94s)]
*  They instead can occupy all of a beautiful area with homes and safety and they can live [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=446.94s)]
*  peace and harmony instead of having to go back and do it again. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=454.32s)]
*  The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=458.15999999999997s)]
*  We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=463.44s)]
*  other weapons on the site. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=468.64s)]
*  Level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=470.96s)]
*  Level it out. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=475.02s)]
*  Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=476.02s)]
*  the people of the area. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=482.52s)]
*  Do a real job. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=483.76s)]
*  Do something different. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=485.68s)]
*  Just can't go back. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=486.68s)]
*  If you go back, it's going to end up the same way it has for 100 years. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=487.68s)]
*  I'm hopeful that this ceasefire could be the beginning of a larger and more enduring [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=492.28s)]
*  peace that will end the bloodshed and killing once and for all. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=496.8s)]
*  With the same goal in mind, my administration has been moving quickly to restore trust in [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=501.12s)]
*  the alliance and rebuild American strength throughout the region. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=506.15999999999997s)]
*  We've really done that. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=509.96s)]
*  We're a respected nation again. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=510.96s)]
*  A lot's happened in the last couple of weeks. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=512.96s)]
*  We are actually a very respected nation again. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=515.56s)]
*  I ended the last administration's de facto arms embargo on over $1 billion in military [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=520.0s)]
*  assistance for Israel. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=526.3199999999999s)]
*  And I'm also pleased to announce that this afternoon the United States withdrew from [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=527.96s)]
*  the anti-Semitic UN Human Rights Council and ended all of the support for the UN Relief [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=532.6s)]
*  and Works Agency, which funneled money to Hamas and which was very disloyal to humanity. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=538.4399999999999s)]
*  Today I also took action to restore a maximum pressure policy on the Iranian regime. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=544.9599999999999s)]
*  And we were once again enforced the most aggressive possible sanctions, drive Iranian oil exports [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=550.9599999999999s)]
*  to zero, and diminish the regime's capacity to fund terror throughout the region and throughout [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=556.4399999999999s)]
*  the world. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=562.4399999999999s)]
*  We had no threat when I left office. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=564.28s)]
*  Iran was not able to sell oil. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=567.72s)]
*  Nobody was buying oil because I said, don't buy it. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=573.28s)]
*  If you buy it, you're not doing any business with the United States. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=575.6800000000001s)]
*  And Hamas was not being funded. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=578.6800000000001s)]
*  Hezbollah was not being funded. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=580.28s)]
*  Nobody was being funded. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=582.96s)]
*  That would never have been on October 7th. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=583.96s)]
*  Two weeks ago I once again designated the Houthis as a terrorist organization. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=587.12s)]
*  They're trying to destroy world shipping lanes and that's not going to happen. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=593.36s)]
*  And over the weekend I ordered airstrikes against senior ISIS leaders hiding in the [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=598.52s)]
*  caves of Somalia and took them out. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=602.76s)]
*  Here in America we've begun the process of deporting foreign terrorists. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=606.4s)]
*  Jihadists and Hamas sympathizers from our soil just as we have people that are extremely [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=610.08s)]
*  evil and we're sending them out of our country. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=617.0s)]
*  They came from jails. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=620.08s)]
*  They came from mental institutions and insane asylums and they were dumped into our country. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=621.8s)]
*  Their gang members, we're getting them out at numbers that nobody can actually believe. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=626.3599999999999s)]
*  And every single country is taking those people back. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=632.64s)]
*  They said they would never take them back and they're all taking them back and they're [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=636.4399999999999s)]
*  taking them back very gladly. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=639.7199999999999s)]
*  And I recently signed an executive order combating the vile wave of anti-Semitism that we've [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=642.28s)]
*  seen in the aftermath of the October 7th attacks. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=647.86s)]
*  Together America and Israel will renew the optimism that shines so brightly just four [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=652.66s)]
*  years ago. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=657.3s)]
*  It was really a bright, beautiful light. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=658.3s)]
*  We will restore calm and stability to the region and expand prosperity, opportunity, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=661.3s)]
*  and hope to our nations and for all people of the Middle East, including the Arab and [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=665.9s)]
*  Muslim nations. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=671.46s)]
*  Very important. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=672.78s)]
*  We want the Arab and Muslim nations to have peace and have tranquility and have great [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=673.78s)]
*  lives. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=680.86s)]
*  I'd like to now invite Prime Minister Netanyahu to say a few words and we'll take some questions [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=681.86s)]
*  afterwards. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=689.5799999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=690.5799999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=693.14s)]
*  I'm honored that you invited me to be the first foreign leader to visit the White House [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=695.62s)]
*  in your second term. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=701.6800000000001s)]
*  This is a testament to your friendship and support for the Jewish state and the Jewish [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=703.96s)]
*  people. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=709.36s)]
*  I've said this before. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=710.36s)]
*  I'll say it again. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=714.32s)]
*  You are the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=715.94s)]
*  That's why the people of Israel have such enormous respect for you. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=726.2s)]
*  In your first term, you recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=730.68s)]
*  You moved the American embassy there. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=735.72s)]
*  You recognized Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=738.28s)]
*  You withdrew from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=741.68s)]
*  I remember we spoke about it. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=745.08s)]
*  You said, this is the worst deal I've ever seen. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=746.72s)]
*  I'm elected. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=750.24s)]
*  I'm walking out of it. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=751.24s)]
*  That's exactly what you did. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=752.24s)]
*  I think it speaks loudly for just common sense, just looking at things and seeing them as [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=754.6s)]
*  they are. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=761.08s)]
*  Of course, you also brokered the groundbreaking Abraham Accords in which Israel made peace [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=762.08s)]
*  with four Arab states. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=768.16s)]
*  We did this in four months. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=769.8s)]
*  Nothing happened for a quarter of a century, but in four months, we were able, working [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=771.8s)]
*  together under your leadership, to have four historic peace accords. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=776.64s)]
*  Now, in the first days of your second term, you picked up right where you left off. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=782.12s)]
*  Your leadership helped bring our hostages home, among them American citizens. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=790.28s)]
*  You freed up munitions that had been withheld from Israel in the midst of a seven-front [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=795.64s)]
*  war for our existence. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=805.2s)]
*  And you just freed it. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=807.64s)]
*  You ended unjust sanctions against law-abiding Israeli citizens. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=809.64s)]
*  You boldly confronted the scourge of anti-Semitism. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=814.6999999999999s)]
*  You stopped funding, as you just said, international organizations like UNRWA that support and [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=819.92s)]
*  fund terrorists. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=826.48s)]
*  And today, you renewed the maximum pressure campaign against Iran. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=828.56s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, all this in just two weeks. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=833.84s)]
*  Can we imagine where we'll be in four years? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=838.88s)]
*  I can. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=842.96s)]
*  I know you can, Mr. President. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=843.96s)]
*  For our part, we in Israel have been pretty busy, too. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=847.68s)]
*  Since the horrendous October 7th attack, we've been fighting our common enemies and changing [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=852.72s)]
*  the face of the Middle East. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=858.76s)]
*  On that infamous day, Hamas monsters savagely murdered 1,200 innocent people, including [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=861.44s)]
*  more than 40 Americans. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=870.8000000000001s)]
*  They beheaded men. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=873.5600000000001s)]
*  They raped women. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=875.24s)]
*  They burned babies alive. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=877.1600000000001s)]
*  And they took 251 people hostage to the dungeons of Gaza. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=880.12s)]
*  And after this worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust, Iran and its henchmen in the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=886.4s)]
*  Middle East were absolutely ecstatic. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=893.3199999999999s)]
*  Aniya praised the massacre. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=897.04s)]
*  Sinwar said that Israel was finished. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=899.12s)]
*  Nasrallah boasted that Israel was, here's what he said, as feeble as a spider's web. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=902.84s)]
*  Well, Mr. President, Aniya is gone. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=909.76s)]
*  Sinwar is gone. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=914.72s)]
*  Nasrallah is gone. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=917.04s)]
*  We've devastated Hamas. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=919.24s)]
*  We decimated Hezbollah. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=921.16s)]
*  We destroyed Assad's remaining armaments. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=923.24s)]
*  And we crippled Iran's air defenses. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=926.68s)]
*  And in doing this, we've defeated some of America's worst enemies. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=929.84s)]
*  We took out terrorists who were wanted for decades for shedding rivers of American blood, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=935.72s)]
*  including the blood of 241 Marines murdered in Beirut. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=943.28s)]
*  We accomplished all this with the indomitable spirit of our people and the boundless courage [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=948.64s)]
*  of our soldiers. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=955.24s)]
*  The Bible says that the people of Israel shall rise like lions, and boy did we rise. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=957.5600000000001s)]
*  Today, the roar of the Lion of Judah is heard loudly throughout the Middle East. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=965.12s)]
*  Israel has never been stronger, and the Iran terror axis has never been weaker. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=971.48s)]
*  But as we discussed, Mr. President, to secure our future and bring peace to our region, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=977.64s)]
*  we have to finish the job. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=985.24s)]
*  In Gaza, Israel has three goals. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=987.76s)]
*  Destroy Hamas' military and governing capabilities, secure the release of all of our hostages, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=990.6s)]
*  and ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=996.88s)]
*  I believe, Mr. President, that your willingness to puncture conventional thinking, thinking [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1002.0s)]
*  that has failed time and time and time again, your willingness to think outside the box [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1008.4399999999999s)]
*  with fresh ideas, will help us achieve all these goals. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1014.56s)]
*  And I've seen you do this many times. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1019.06s)]
*  You cut to the chase. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1021.98s)]
*  You see things others refuse to see. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1024.38s)]
*  You say things others refuse to say. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1028.8000000000002s)]
*  And after the jaws drop, people scratch their heads, and they say, you know, he's right. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1031.7s)]
*  And this is the kind of thinking that enabled us to bring the Abraham Accords. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1040.22s)]
*  This is the kind of thinking that will reshape the Middle East and bring peace. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1045.5400000000002s)]
*  We also see eye to eye on Iran. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1051.26s)]
*  That's the same Iran. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1057.6s)]
*  They try to kill us both. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1059.14s)]
*  They try to kill you, Mr. President. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1061.6s)]
*  They try through their proxies to kill me. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1064.42s)]
*  We're both committed to rolling back Iran's aggression in the region and ensuring that [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1068.04s)]
*  Iran never develops a nuclear weapon. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1073.06s)]
*  Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, Israel will end the war by winning the war. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1077.52s)]
*  Israel's victory will be America's victory. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1085.8799999999999s)]
*  We will not only win the war, working together, we will win the peace. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1089.04s)]
*  With your leadership, Mr. President, and our partnership, I believe that we will forge [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1095.52s)]
*  a brilliant future for our region and bring our great alliance to even greater heights. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1100.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1107.76s)]

*  JD Vance, everybody. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1111.76s)]
*  JD, please, Vice President, stand up. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1112.76s)]
*  He's been doing a good job. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1117.84s)]
*  He's been working very hard on all things, but this in particular. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1118.84s)]
*  We'll take some questions, please. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1124.52s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1126.4799999999998s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1128.32s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1129.32s)]
*  Mr. President, can a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia be achieved without the acknowledgement [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1131.28s)]
*  of a Palestinian state? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1137.3999999999999s)]
*  That question is for you, too, Mr. Prime Minister. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1138.3999999999999s)]
*  And Mr. President, given what you've said about Gaza, did the U.S. send troops to help [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1141.28s)]
*  secure the security vacuum? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1145.6799999999998s)]
*  So Saudi Arabia is going to be very helpful, and they have been very helpful. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1149.12s)]
*  They want peace in the Middle East. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1152.6s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1153.9199999999998s)]
*  We know their leader and their leaders very well. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1156.48s)]
*  They're wonderful people, and they want peace in the Middle East. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1159.3200000000002s)]
*  As far as Gaza is concerned, we'll do what is necessary. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1162.6000000000001s)]
*  If it's necessary, we'll do that. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1165.96s)]
*  We're going to take over that peace, and we're going to develop it, create thousands and [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1168.0800000000002s)]
*  thousands of jobs, and it'll be something that the entire Middle East can be very proud [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1172.48s)]
*  of. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1177.3600000000001s)]
*  But everybody feels that continuing the same process has gone on forever, over and over [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1178.52s)]
*  again, and then it starts, and then the killing starts, and all of the other problems start, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1185.72s)]
*  and you end up in the same place, and we don't want to see that happen. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1191.92s)]
*  So by the United States, with its stability and strength, owning it, especially the strength [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1196.4s)]
*  that we're developing and developed over the last fairly short period of time, I would [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1201.1200000000001s)]
*  say really since the election, I think we'll be a great keeper of something that is very, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1205.0800000000002s)]
*  very strong, very powerful, and very, very good for the area, not just for Israel, for [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1212.44s)]
*  the entire Middle East. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1216.48s)]
*  It's very important, and we'll again have thousands of jobs, and there'll be jobs for [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1217.48s)]
*  everyone, not for a specific group of people, but for everybody. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1222.12s)]
*  Okay? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1226.6399999999999s)]
*  Please. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1227.6399999999999s)]
*  I think peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia is not only feasible. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1228.6399999999999s)]
*  I think it's going to happen. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1235.12s)]
*  I think if we had another half a year in your first term, it would have already happened. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1236.44s)]
*  True. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1243.1200000000001s)]
*  Many, many more, I agree, many more nations. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1244.1200000000001s)]
*  I think you can't prejudge and pre-guess how we'll achieve it, but I'm committed to achieving [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1246.32s)]
*  it, and I know the president is committed to achieving it, and I think the Saudi leadership [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1253.8400000000001s)]
*  is interested to achieve it. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1257.96s)]
*  So we'll give it a good shot, and I think we'll succeed. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1260.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, please, go ahead. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1263.92s)]
*  Mr. President, did you hear from Prime Minister Niyah al-Khattab, guaranteeing that ceasefire [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1266.92s)]
*  will hold, including about phase two, and planning for a new government? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1272.88s)]
*  Why are you refusing to send the national commission to investigate the dangers of ceasefire? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1277.88s)]
*  Well, I can't tell you whether or not the ceasefire will hold. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1283.88s)]
*  We've done, I think, a very masterful job. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1286.96s)]
*  We weren't helped very much by the Biden administration, I can tell you that. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1291.28s)]
*  But we've gotten quite a few hostages out. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1296.08s)]
*  We're going to get more out. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1299.36s)]
*  But we're dealing with very complex people, and we are going to see whether or not it [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1301.36s)]
*  holds. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1306.04s)]
*  We certainly want to have more come out. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1307.04s)]
*  They've come out damaged in many ways, damaged, very damaged people. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1309.0s)]
*  But they're going to get better, and they're going to be strong, and they're going to have [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1314.84s)]
*  a good life, and we hope to get as many as possible out. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1317.84s)]
*  Whether or not it holds, I don't know. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1321.28s)]
*  We hope it holds. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1322.6s)]
*  We hope it holds. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1323.96s)]
*  I think that the appropriate time, which I think will enable us to really investigate [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1326.96s)]
*  what happens, what were the causes of the failures by an independent commission that [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1333.36s)]
*  will be accepted by the majority of the people? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1339.76s)]
*  We don't want it accepted by one half of the people and not the other. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1344.28s)]
*  I think we should have it, and we should find out exactly what happened. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1348.4s)]
*  I'm insisting on it. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1352.64s)]
*  And believe me, it will surprise a lot of people when it happens. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1354.88s)]
*  Kelly, Kelly, go ahead. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1358.5600000000002s)]
*  You are outlining something that is really quite striking tonight. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1362.5600000000002s)]
*  You are talking about... [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1365.7600000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1369.7600000000002s)]
*  You are talking tonight about the United States taking over a sovereign territory. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1371.6000000000001s)]
*  What authority would allow you to do that? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1376.64s)]
*  Are you talking about a permanent occupation there, redevelopment? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1378.64s)]
*  Do you see this idea as a way to expand the boundaries of Israel and to have a longer [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1384.32s)]
*  peace, even though the Israeli people know how important that land is to you and your [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1390.24s)]
*  citizens, just as the space is inherited by the Palestinians as well? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1396.48s)]
*  I do see a long-term ownership position, and I see it bringing great stability to that [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1402.6399999999999s)]
*  part of the Middle East and maybe the entire Middle East. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1409.68s)]
*  And everybody I've spoken to, this was not a decision made lightly. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1412.96s)]
*  Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1416.96s)]
*  developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent in a [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1422.24s)]
*  really magnificent area that nobody would know. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1427.52s)]
*  Nobody can look because all they see is death and destruction and rubble and demolished [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1429.68s)]
*  buildings falling all over. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1435.92s)]
*  It's just a terrible sight. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1437.3600000000001s)]
*  I've studied it. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1440.4s)]
*  I've studied this very closely over a lot of months, and I've seen it from every different [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1441.44s)]
*  angle. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1447.28s)]
*  And it's a very, very dangerous place to be. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1448.16s)]
*  And it's only going to get worse. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1450.72s)]
*  And I think this is an idea that's gotten tremendous. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1453.04s)]
*  And I'm talking about from the highest level of leadership, gotten tremendous praise. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1456.4s)]
*  And if the United States can help to bring stability and peace in the Middle East, we'll [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1461.3600000000001s)]
*  do that. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1465.76s)]
*  I mentioned again tonight our three goals. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1470.24s)]
*  And the third goal is to make sure that Gaza never poses a threat to Israel again. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1474.8s)]
*  President Trump is taking it to a much higher level. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1480.8799999999999s)]
*  He sees a different future for that piece of land that has been the focus of so much [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1484.08s)]
*  terrorism, so many attacks against us, so many trials and so many tribulations. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1492.32s)]
*  He has a different idea. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1500.6399999999999s)]
*  And I think it's worth paying attention to this. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1502.7199999999998s)]
*  We're talking about it. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1505.84s)]
*  He's exploring it with his people, with his staff. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1507.9199999999998s)]
*  I think it's something that could change history. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1511.12s)]
*  And it's worthwhile really pursuing this avenue. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1514.0s)]
*  Yeah, please go ahead. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1517.52s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1519.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1520.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1522.48s)]
*  So, before rebuilding Gaza again, obviously, take out all the hostages. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1524.48s)]
*  And one of them is Rodan Alexander, an American soldier who is alive. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1530.48s)]
*  How will you be sure that you will take out all the hostages and then rebuild? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1534.48s)]
*  It's very hard to get all the hostages. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1542.48s)]
*  The word is all. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1544.16s)]
*  And we're working very hard. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1545.36s)]
*  So far, it's been moving along fairly rapidly, pretty much on schedule. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1547.36s)]
*  I'd love to have them all out at one time, but we're taking them out. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1553.4399999999998s)]
*  And tomorrow, more are being released. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1557.12s)]
*  And over the days, more. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1559.28s)]
*  And then we're going to a phase two. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1560.4799999999998s)]
*  But we'd like to get all of the hostages. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1563.12s)]
*  And if we don't, it will just make us somewhat more violent, I will tell you that, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1565.1999999999998s)]
*  because they would have broken their word. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1572.56s)]
*  Mr. Witkoff and his entire group have been working 24 hours around the clock. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1574.64s)]
*  And they want them out. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1581.2800000000002s)]
*  And promises have been made to them. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1582.4s)]
*  And we'll see whether or not those promises will be kept. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1585.0400000000002s)]
*  But we want all the hostages. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1588.4s)]
*  That's right. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1589.8400000000001s)]
*  How much time do you think it will take? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1590.3200000000002s)]
*  Come on. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1591.92s)]
*  Do you support, Mr. President, do you support Israeli sovereignty in Judean Samaria areas [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1592.42s)]
*  which many believe is biblical homeland of the Jewish people? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1599.0400000000002s)]
*  Well, we're discussing that with many of your representatives. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1602.88s)]
*  You represented very well. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1606.5600000000002s)]
*  And people do like the idea, but we haven't taken a position on it yet. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1608.48s)]
*  But we will be making an announcement, probably, on that very specific topic [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1613.7600000000002s)]
*  over the next four weeks. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1619.68s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1624.8000000000002s)]
*  Please. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1625.5200000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much, Mr. President. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1626.1s)]
*  So you just said that you think all the Palestinians should be relocated to other countries. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1628.18s)]
*  Does that mean that you do not support a two-state solution? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1637.62s)]
*  It doesn't mean anything about a two-state or one state or any other state. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1641.46s)]
*  It means that we want to have, we want to give people a chance at life. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1646.1s)]
*  They have never had a chance at life because the Gaza Strip has been [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1650.26s)]
*  a hellhole for people living there. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1654.02s)]
*  It's been horrible. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1655.94s)]
*  Hamas has made it so bad, so bad, so dangerous, so unfair to people. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1657.46s)]
*  And by doing what I'm recommending that we do, it's a very strong recommendation, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1664.82s)]
*  but it is a strong recommendation. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1669.3799999999999s)]
*  By doing that, we think we're going to bring perhaps great peace to long beyond this area. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1671.1399999999999s)]
*  And I have to stress, this is not for Israel. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1676.8999999999999s)]
*  This is for everybody in the Middle East, Arabs, Muslims. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1680.5s)]
*  This is for everybody. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1683.38s)]
*  This would be where they can partake in terms of jobs and living and all of the other benefits. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1684.42s)]
*  And I think it's very important. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1690.66s)]
*  It just doesn't work the other way. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1692.1s)]
*  You know, you can't keep trying. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1693.62s)]
*  They just has been going along for so many decades. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1695.46s)]
*  You can't even count. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1699.06s)]
*  You just can't keep doing. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1700.26s)]
*  You have to learn from history. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1701.7s)]
*  You can't keep doing the same mistake over and over again. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1702.74s)]
*  Gaza is a hellhole right now. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1707.22s)]
*  It was before the bombing started, frankly. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1709.54s)]
*  And we're going to give people a chance to live in a beautiful community that's safe and secure. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1712.42s)]
*  And I think you're going to see tremendous, a tremendous outflowing of support. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1718.26s)]
*  I can tell you I spoke to other leaders of countries in the Middle East and they love the idea. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1724.18s)]
*  They say it would really bring stability and what we need is stability. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1729.7s)]
*  Yes, sir, please. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1733.46s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1735.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1737.22s)]
*  Are you still committed to imposing sanctions on the ICC despite the move being stalled in the [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1738.52s)]
*  Senate? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1744.3600000000001s)]
*  And please, a question for the Prime Minister as well. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1744.8600000000001s)]
*  The President has been very clear about his desire to achieve a deal with Saudi Arabia. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1747.4s)]
*  How do you settle this if Israel is required to renew the war against Hamas in the future? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1752.2s)]
*  Go ahead, baby. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1758.68s)]
*  I think everybody understands that just as the President fought and defeated al-Qaeda, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1761.56s)]
*  and ISIS, that we can't leave Hamas there because Hamas will continue the battle to [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1768.28s)]
*  destroy Israel. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1774.44s)]
*  They'll do, you know, when in this temporary ceasefire, one of their leaders comes out, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1775.56s)]
*  you know what he says? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1781.32s)]
*  We're going to do October 7th again, except we'll do it bigger. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1783.08s)]
*  So obviously, you can't talk about peace neither with Hamas or in the Middle East if this, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1788.6000000000001s)]
*  you know, toxic, murderous organization is left standing. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1796.12s)]
*  Anymore that you could make peace in Europe after World War II if the Nazi regime was left [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1801.0s)]
*  standing and the Nazi army was left standing. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1806.6s)]
*  You want a different future? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1809.3999999999999s)]
*  You got to knock out the people who want to destroy you and destroy peace. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1810.6s)]
*  That's what we're going to do. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1814.28s)]
*  I think that will also bring usher in, actually, the peace with Saudi Arabia and with others, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1816.04s)]
*  and I think there'll be others too. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1822.04s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1823.8s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1824.6s)]
*  President, I'm from Afghanistan. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1825.56s)]
*  My name is Miss Gaisi Ferevia, Afghan support woman, as I expectation from you. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1826.6799999999998s)]
*  Do you have any plan to change Afghanistan situation? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1831.3999999999999s)]
*  Are you able to recognize Taliban? [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1834.36s)]
*  Because I'm an Afghan journalist, Afghan support woman. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1837.0s)]
*  Any comment about Afghanistan? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1840.44s)]
*  What's your future plan for Afghan people, especially Afghan? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1842.04s)]
*  I have a little hard time understanding you. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1845.24s)]
*  Where are you from? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1848.2s)]
*  Afghanistan. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1848.84s)]
*  Actually, it's a beautiful voice and a beautiful accent. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1851.24s)]
*  The only problem is I can't understand a word you're saying. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1854.68s)]
*  But I just say this. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1858.28s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1860.36s)]
*  Live in peace. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1861.24s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1862.36s)]
*  That's okay. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1867.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1868.44s)]
*  You said earlier today it was tough for you to implement these sanctions on Iran, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1871.0s)]
*  but you did indicate that you were willing to negotiate with them. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1876.6s)]
*  What would that look like, and are you in conversations with them? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1879.3999999999999s)]
*  To say to the Prime Minister? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1883.32s)]
*  I hated doing it. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1884.52s)]
*  I want Iran to be peaceful and successful. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1886.36s)]
*  I hated doing it. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1889.96s)]
*  I did it once before, and we brought them down to a level where they were unable to [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1891.3999999999999s)]
*  give any money. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1896.36s)]
*  They had to survive themselves, and they had no money. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1897.08s)]
*  They were essentially broke. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1900.1999999999998s)]
*  And they had no money for, as I said, Hezbollah. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1903.24s)]
*  They had no money for Hamas. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1906.04s)]
*  They had no money for any form of terror. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1907.48s)]
*  The 28, if you call it, the 28 sites of terror, they had no money for any of it. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1909.72s)]
*  They had to do their own and focus on their own well-being. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1916.68s)]
*  And I hated to do it then, and I hate to do it just as much now. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1920.92s)]
*  And I say this, and I say this to Iran, who is listening very intently. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1925.8s)]
*  I would love to be able to make a great deal, a deal where you can get on with your lives, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1930.44s)]
*  and you'll do wonderfully. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1935.96s)]
*  You'll do wonderfully. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1938.44s)]
*  Incredible people, industrious, beautiful, just an unbelievable group of people in Iran. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1939.4s)]
*  And I know them well. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1946.8400000000001s)]
*  I have many friends from Iran and many friends that are Americans from Iran, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1947.64s)]
*  and they're very proud of Iran. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1953.8s)]
*  But I hated to do it, just so you understand. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1955.88s)]
*  And I hope we're going to be able to do something so that it doesn't end up in [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1959.0s)]
*  a very catastrophic situation. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1962.92s)]
*  I don't want to see that happen. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1965.64s)]
*  I really want to see peace, and I hope that we're able to do that. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1969.24s)]
*  They cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1972.2s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1973.8000000000002s)]
*  I'm not putting restrictions. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1975.16s)]
*  I'm not—they cannot have—one thing, they cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1976.76s)]
*  And if I think that they will have a nuclear weapon, despite what I just said, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1981.72s)]
*  I think that's going to be very unfortunate for them. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1987.0800000000002s)]
*  If, on the other hand, they can convince us that they won't—and I hope they can. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1989.64s)]
*  It's very easy to do. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1993.4s)]
*  It's actually very easy to do. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1994.52s)]
*  I think they're going to have an unbelievable future. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1996.76s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=1999.56s)]
*  Sir, go ahead. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2000.12s)]
*  Q Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2001.24s)]
*  You just laid out your plan for Gaza. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2003.56s)]
*  THE PRESIDENT Yes. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2005.96s)]
*  Q Can you lay out your plan for Ukraine and also— [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2006.44s)]
*  THE PRESIDENT For Ukraine? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2010.04s)]
*  Q For Ukraine, yes. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2011.16s)]
*  You consider yourself a strong leader. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2012.76s)]
*  You blamed your predecessor for letting Russia to take over Ukraine. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2015.56s)]
*  Will you demand from Putin to get out of Ukraine, from the sovereign territory of Ukraine? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2020.92s)]
*  THE PRESIDENT So we're dealing right now on the subject. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2026.2s)]
*  I don't want to spend a lot of time because we're here for another reason. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2028.8400000000001s)]
*  But we are having very good talks, very constructive talks on Ukraine. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2031.24s)]
*  And we are talking to the Russians. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2036.3600000000001s)]
*  We're talking to the Ukrainian leadership. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2038.68s)]
*  It would have never happened. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2042.2s)]
*  That would have never happened. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2043.48s)]
*  It should have never happened. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2044.68s)]
*  I get reports every week the number of soldiers, mostly soldiers now, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2046.52s)]
*  the cities have been largely demolished. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2050.44s)]
*  You talk about a very sad sight to see. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2053.16s)]
*  We talk Gaza. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2057.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, many of these cities look as bad as Gaza and worse, what's happened to them. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2058.04s)]
*  And I want to see that end. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2063.88s)]
*  And I want to see it end for one simple reason, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2065.88s)]
*  the life of young people being absolutely obliterated on both sides. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2068.28s)]
*  You probably have 700,000 Ukrainian soldiers dead, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2072.92s)]
*  800,000 maybe more Russian soldiers dead. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2077.0s)]
*  It's very flat land. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2081.0s)]
*  And the only thing that's going to stop a bullet is a human body. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2082.28s)]
*  In this case, usually soldiers. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2086.36s)]
*  And the numbers are staggering when you hear the real numbers in Ukraine, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2088.84s)]
*  what the numbers are. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2092.52s)]
*  And this doesn't include the cities that have been demolished [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2093.8s)]
*  and all of the people that were killed. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2096.52s)]
*  So I want to see it stopped. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2099.16s)]
*  We're having very good talks and I think we're going to get it. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2100.44s)]
*  I think something will be, hopefully dramatically, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2102.76s)]
*  it will rise above everything. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2107.24s)]
*  You have to, you can't let this continue. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2110.52s)]
*  This is an absolute slaughter that's taking place on the beautiful farmlands of Ukraine [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2113.3199999999997s)]
*  and we have to stop it. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2120.12s)]
*  We can't let this continue. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2121.3199999999997s)]
*  It's a human tragedy and we're going to try very hard to stop it. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2122.6s)]
*  Yeah, please go ahead, sir. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2132.04s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2133.3199999999997s)]
*  Mr. President, what's your view about the [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2133.7999999999997s)]
*  Obama's role in all the regional changes you want to do? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2141.3199999999997s)]
*  And the question of the climate, sir, what's your view on President Trump wanting to reach [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2145.16s)]
*  a deal with Iran and not a much more active ministry stands for? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2149.9599999999996s)]
*  Go ahead, baby. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2154.6s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2155.3199999999997s)]
*  I think the president just said something that I think is the [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2156.52s)]
*  pivot of everything that we're talking about. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2161.3199999999997s)]
*  He said Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and we fully agree with that. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2163.56s)]
*  If this goal can be achieved by a maximum pressure campaign, so be it. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2169.0s)]
*  But I think the most important thing is to focus on the goal, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2174.3599999999997s)]
*  which the president just did and I fully agree with him. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2178.52s)]
*  Well, I said it and he said it very well. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2185.9599999999996s)]
*  It's a campaign of pressure to see if we can get something done. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2187.88s)]
*  He doesn't want to do what some people think will automatically happen because they're very [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2194.36s)]
*  difficult people to deal with, as you know. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2198.76s)]
*  But if we could solve this problem without [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2201.96s)]
*  warfare, without all of the things that you've been witnessing over the last [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2205.48s)]
*  number of years, it would be I think it would be a tremendous thing. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2209.8s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2214.6s)]
*  Do you have any plans to visit Israel? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2218.36s)]
*  To visit where? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2221.2400000000002s)]
*  Israel. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2222.28s)]
*  And Gaza. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2223.0s)]
*  Well, I love Israel. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2223.88s)]
*  I will visit there and I'll visit Gaza and I'll visit Saudi Arabia [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2225.7200000000003s)]
*  and I'll visit other places all over the Middle East. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2229.88s)]
*  The Middle East is an incredible place, so vibrant. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2232.6s)]
*  So it's just one of the really beautiful places with great people. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2235.0s)]
*  And I think a lot of bad leadership has taken place in the Middle East. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2242.28s)]
*  That's allowed this to happen. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2246.76s)]
*  It's just terrible. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2248.28s)]
*  And that includes on the American side, by the way. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2249.0800000000004s)]
*  We should have never gone in there a long time ago, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2251.6400000000003s)]
*  spent trillions of dollars and created so much death. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2254.84s)]
*  So it includes Americans. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2258.92s)]
*  But yeah, I'll be visiting a lot of different places in the Middle East. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2260.6000000000004s)]
*  I've been invited everywhere, but I will be visiting some. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2265.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2268.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2269.0800000000004s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2272.1200000000003s)]
*  Caitlin, go ahead. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2272.92s)]
*  Thank you so much, President Trump. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2273.8s)]
*  Caitlin, go ahead. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2275.16s)]
*  Just to follow up on what you were saying there. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2275.96s)]
*  Say it. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2277.3199999999997s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2278.04s)]
*  Just to follow up on what you were saying about the Gazans leaving Gaza, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2278.52s)]
*  going to other countries. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2282.12s)]
*  One, where exactly are you suggesting that they should go? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2283.16s)]
*  And two, are you saying they should return after it's rebuilt? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2286.12s)]
*  And if not, who do you envision living there? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2289.0s)]
*  I envision the world, people living there, the world's people. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2292.2s)]
*  I think you'll make that into an international, unbelievable place. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2297.56s)]
*  I think the potential and the Gaza Strip is unbelievable. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2302.6s)]
*  And I think the entire world, representatives from all over the world will be there. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2306.44s)]
*  And they'll live there. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2311.56s)]
*  Palestinians also. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2312.68s)]
*  Palestinians will live there. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2313.7999999999997s)]
*  Many people will live there. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2315.24s)]
*  But they've tried the other and they've tried it for decades and decades and decades. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2317.0s)]
*  It's not going to work. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2322.44s)]
*  It didn't work. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2323.4s)]
*  It will never work. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2324.12s)]
*  You have to learn from history. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2327.64s)]
*  History just can't let it keep repeating itself. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2329.24s)]
*  We have an opportunity to do something that could be phenomenal. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2333.0s)]
*  And I don't want to be cute. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2337.9599999999996s)]
*  I don't want to be a wise guy. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2339.4799999999996s)]
*  But the Riviera of the Middle East, this could be something that could be so magnificent. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2340.7599999999998s)]
*  But more importantly than that is the people that have been absolutely destroyed, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2347.24s)]
*  that live there now, can live in peace in a much better situation. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2352.3599999999997s)]
*  Because they're living in hell and those people will now be able to live in peace. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2357.08s)]
*  We'll make sure that it's done world class. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2361.4s)]
*  It'll be wonderful for the people. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2363.72s)]
*  Palestinians, Palestinians, mostly we're talking about. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2365.72s)]
*  And I have a feeling that despite them saying no, I have a feeling that the king in Jordan [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2369.4s)]
*  and that the general president, but that the general in Egypt will open their hearts [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2375.16s)]
*  and will give us the kind of land that we need to get this done. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2381.72s)]
*  And people can live in harmony and in peace. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2385.72s)]

*  President Trump says he wants the U.S. to take over the Gaza Strip and redevelop it [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2413.72s)]
*  once Palestinians are settled elsewhere. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2418.28s)]
*  The president saying that he didn't want to be cute, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2421.64s)]
*  but that it could be called the Riviera of the Middle East. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2423.88s)]
*  He envisions people living there after it's redeveloped and says he has a feeling that [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2426.12s)]
*  even though the leaders of Jordan and Egypt has said they do not want to take in Palestinian [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2430.84s)]
*  refugees, that they will open their hearts and give us the land that we need to get this done [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2435.16s)]
*  and people can live in harmony. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2439.56s)]
*  And in response, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that he believes this idea would change [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2440.84s)]
*  history and is worthwhile to pursue. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2444.76s)]
*  Netanyahu also said that Israel and the U.S. were on the same page with Iran and both committed [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2447.6400000000003s)]
*  to holding back Iran's aggression in the region. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2452.04s)]
*  Netanyahu said Israel will end the war by winning the war and that Israel's victory [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2454.84s)]
*  will be America's victory. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2458.92s)]
*  Now, Netanyahu told Trump that he is the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2461.2400000000002s)]
*  speaking to President Trump being very complimentary during his remarks. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2467.48s)]
*  And also interestingly saying that one of the goals of Israel was to ensure that Gaza [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2472.12s)]
*  never poses a threat to Israel. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2476.92s)]
*  Not saying Hamas, but saying Gaza. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2479.56s)]
*  Let's go ahead and go to CBS News senior White House correspondent, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2481.64s)]
*  Ouija Jang, who was inside the room during that press conference. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2483.96s)]
*  She joins us now. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2486.6s)]
*  Ouija, quite a lot of news involving the president saying the U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2487.32s)]
*  He was asked many logistics and many specifics about this, whether the U.S. would send troops [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2494.36s)]
*  to take over a sovereign territory. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2499.2400000000002s)]
*  What answers did we get about how this would work? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2501.56s)]
*  And is this something that we've heard before from the president? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2504.12s)]
*  Lindsay, this is not something that we have heard before in terms of the U.S. occupation [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2509.2400000000002s)]
*  of the Gaza Strip. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2514.84s)]
*  And to answer your question about what details you provided, I think he actually begged much [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2515.96s)]
*  more questions than any concrete answers about the logistics of how this would work, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2522.28s)]
*  the legality of how this would work, the cost. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2528.2000000000003s)]
*  And even though he talked at length about this beautiful rebuilding that he envisions, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2531.8s)]
*  there are a lot of issues that have to be addressed before even getting there. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2538.6000000000004s)]
*  Take us through those issues, Ouija. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2543.2400000000002s)]
*  He did say that he thought it should be a—well, he did say that there would be a world population [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2544.1200000000003s)]
*  that lived there. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2551.96s)]
*  But right now, Lindsay, let's remember that there are two million-some Palestinians that [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2552.52s)]
*  live there who do not want to leave because that is their home. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2559.48s)]
*  And they have made it very clear that they are not interested in vacating the Gaza Strip. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2563.7200000000003s)]
*  There's also the issue of where they would go if they were displaced. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2569.8s)]
*  And Egypt and Jordan have made abundantly clear that they are not going to take those [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2575.2400000000002s)]
*  displaced refugees, even though President Trump reiterated tonight that he believes [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2581.4s)]
*  they ultimately will. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2586.36s)]
*  He has also said that other countries have offered to take them in. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2587.96s)]
*  So, you know, that is two big questions, where they would go in the meantime of this rebuilding. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2592.52s)]
*  And how do you force Palestinians out if they do not want to leave? [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2598.2000000000003s)]
*  And so I think it's really important, Lindsay, to point out that that—the rebuilding of [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2605.08s)]
*  Gaza at all is phase three of the ceasefire deal that was signed in the Biden administration, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2610.44s)]
*  and that it is now up to the Trump administration to carry out. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2618.36s)]
*  But first, we have to get to phase two, which involves the release of all the male hostages, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2621.56s)]
*  as well as the complete withdrawal of IDF forces from Gaza. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2627.8s)]
*  And that's, I think, what has been missing from the conversation here, because that is [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2633.8s)]
*  a critical part to ending the war. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2638.52s)]
*  And you can't really talk about rebuilding Gaza until the war there is over. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2641.64s)]
*  And so it is a bit of a distraction from the issue at hand, which is where do negotiations [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2647.08s)]
*  stand on that phase two, on the war coming to a permanent ceasefire? [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2653.88s)]
*  And so far, we don't have answers about under what conditions Israel would be willing to [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2659.56s)]
*  do that. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2665.0s)]
*  In fact, they are still negotiating those terms for phase two and phase three, but certainly [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2665.72s)]
*  big headlines coming out because President Trump made such a remarkable suggestion that [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2671.3199999999997s)]
*  the U.S. would occupy and control Gaza. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2678.52s)]
*  Lindsay? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2682.8399999999997s)]
*  Weijia, you did mention the ceasefire. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2683.3199999999997s)]
*  The president said, we will see whether it holds. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2685.0s)]
*  We hope it holds. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2687.08s)]
*  And the prime minister saying we can't leave Hamas there because Hamas will continue to [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2688.12s)]
*  battle Israel. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2691.8799999999997s)]
*  Does that leave you to believe that Israel is not finished on the battlefield? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2692.68s)]
*  Yes, I think that Prime Minister Netanyahu has made that very clear as well, because [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2700.52s)]
*  he says he has three very clear objectives, which is to get all the hostages back, reunited [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2706.12s)]
*  with their families, all the hostages returned. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2712.2799999999997s)]
*  He said number two is eliminating Hamas and number three is ensuring that this never happens [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2714.7599999999998s)]
*  again. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2720.04s)]
*  And so that position from Netanyahu has not changed. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2720.92s)]
*  He has said time and time again that militarily the war will end when Israel is able to declare [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2723.88s)]
*  victory. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2730.84s)]
*  And under the previous administration, the problem was that the definition of a victory [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2731.7200000000003s)]
*  was depending on who you asked. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2737.0s)]
*  And so for Netanyahu, it is never wavered. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2739.88s)]
*  And the problem is how do you eliminate all of Hamas? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2743.88s)]
*  And if you cannot ensure that all of Hamas down to the very last general, the very last [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2748.36s)]
*  soldier is eliminated considering the way that they embed with civilians, then how does [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2753.6400000000003s)]
*  the war actually come to an end? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2758.92s)]
*  And these are questions that Netanyahu did not answer because we, again, we didn't really [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2761.1600000000003s)]
*  talk about the nitty gritty of where negotiations stand for any kind of permanent ceasefire. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2765.8s)]
*  And so they are getting a little bit ahead of themselves here, Lindsay, talking about [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2771.88s)]
*  the future of Gaza when there is still very much an ongoing war there and we don't know [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2775.7999999999997s)]
*  when the current ceasefire could end. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2781.24s)]
*  And we, Joe, of course, we know and we here at CBS have covered and will continue to cover [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2784.6s)]
*  everything that is coming out of this Trump White House, including USAID funding and the [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2789.64s)]
*  organization essentially screeching to a halt while the Trump administration overhauls it. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2794.6s)]
*  The Department of Education coming into question and whether that will be either overhauled [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2798.7599999999998s)]
*  or gotten rid of entirely. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2803.0s)]
*  The DOJ asking for a list of FBI employee IDs of agents who worked on January 6 cases, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2804.36s)]
*  cabinet confirmations on Capitol Hill. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2810.84s)]
*  But taking all of that holistically, do you expect that what we heard tonight will now [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2812.92s)]
*  dominate headlines tomorrow and in the coming days ahead because of just the magnitude of [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2817.6400000000003s)]
*  what the president is suggesting? [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2821.7200000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2825.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, Lindsay, I guess in short, you're saying that we are a very busy White House team and [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2827.56s)]
*  there are things coming from every angle on the domestic front, on the international front. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2832.36s)]
*  And, you know, part of the strategy has always been to, quote, flood the zone and to make sure [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2838.04s)]
*  that there is this much going on as the president lays out his agenda and his goals. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2844.92s)]
*  But there is a lot to get to, Lindsay. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2852.84s)]
*  And, you know, not to mention the brand new reporting that our colleague, Camila Montoya [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2855.8s)]
*  Goya, has just broke tonight that ICE detention facilities are running out of space to handle [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2861.0s)]
*  the detained migrants, so much so that they have had to release nearly 200 detained migrants this [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2869.8s)]
*  week alone because they don't have any more beds. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2876.76s)]
*  So, of course, we know that the mass deportations is at the top of the president's priority list [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2879.4s)]
*  when it comes to domestic policy. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2884.92s)]
*  And that's another story that we will be reporting out in the days to come, Lindsay. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2887.0s)]
*  We're judging. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2892.44s)]
*  We appreciate your hard work and everybody else in your unit. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2893.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRtXTXJgm3E&t=2895.96s)]
