# Israel's security cabinet approves Gaza ceasefire deal
**CBS News:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4)
*  But first, we are following breaking news out of Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=0.0s)]
*  The country's security cabinet moments ago approved the ceasefire, hostage release and [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=3.04s)]
*  prisoner release deal with Hamas in Gaza. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=8.14s)]
*  This is significant. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=10.98s)]
*  Following the latest for us from Tel Aviv is CBS News' senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=12.6s)]
*  Palmer. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=16.38s)]
*  Liz, help us understand why this is such an important moment in getting us closer to the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=17.38s)]
*  first hostage release Sunday. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=22.52s)]
*  Well, it means an end to the bombing of Gaza and the misery of 2.2 million people and, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=27.0s)]
*  of course, the misery of 98 hostages and their families who are imprisoned in the Gaza Strip [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=34.96s)]
*  under those bombs at the same time. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=42.24s)]
*  It's very welcome news because so many people have suffered so very much in the 15 months [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=45.2s)]
*  since Hamas started this war by invading Israel. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  There was a ceasefire previously in November of 2023 that quickly fell apart. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  Give us a sense from the people you've been speaking with of how much optimism there is [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=63.64s)]
*  that this time this will hold. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=68.16s)]
*  It depends who you speak to. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=72.12s)]
*  I think that the country is a year more exhausted. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=77.64s)]
*  The Gazans are, you know, they've been crushed. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=83.08s)]
*  Most of them are living in temporary housing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=87.76s)]
*  I think the desperation for a deal really runs deep and also into the violence. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=89.88s)]
*  There's also the Trump factor. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=97.4s)]
*  Several people have told me that they think this ceasefire is going to hold because President [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=99.68s)]
*  Trump has made it clear that he doesn't want this war anymore and he's made it very clear [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=105.24s)]
*  to Benjamin Netanyahu that he doesn't want the fighting to start again and he'd better [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  make sure it doesn't. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=114.0s)]
*  Now I know all the details are still coming together, but what do we know about the Palestinian [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  prisoners held by Israel who are also meant to be released as part of this overall deal? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  Think of it this way. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=126.68s)]
*  Roughly speaking, 30 Palestinian prisoners will be released for every Israeli hostage [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=132.32s)]
*  if that hostage is civilian. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=138.36s)]
*  If it's a military, 50 Palestinian prisoners will be released for the military hostages. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=139.84s)]
*  They're not coming out in this first batch, by the way. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=147.96s)]
*  That'll be later on. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=150.60000000000002s)]
*  Overall, about 1,700 Palestinian prisoners are due to be released between now and six [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=152.84s)]
*  weeks down the road. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=159.84s)]
*  That is mid-February. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=160.84s)]
*  All right, Elizabeth Palmer with us. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=161.84s)]
*  Joining us from Tel Aviv with the latest on the steps toward peace in the region. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  Elizabeth, thank you. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POxM82UhvL4&t=170.36s)]
