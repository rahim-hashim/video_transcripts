# Trump administration pauses military aid to Ukraine
**CBS News:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXH49NQbw_c)
*  We have some breaking news. CBS News has confirmed the Trump administration is pausing all military [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXH49NQbw_c&t=0.0s)]
*  aid to Ukraine. Pentagon reporter Eleanor Watson joins us now. Eleanor, what do we know? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXH49NQbw_c&t=10.92s)]
*  The White House official confirmed to CBS that the president is pausing and reviewing all [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXH49NQbw_c&t=17.96s)]
*  aid to Ukraine to ensure that it is contributing to a solution. Now, this comes after the skirmish, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXH49NQbw_c&t=24.4s)]
*  for lack of a better word, in the Oval Office on Friday between President Trump and President [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXH49NQbw_c&t=32.48s)]
*  Zelensky. Now, the Trump administration had not promised any new military aid to Ukraine, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXH49NQbw_c&t=38.12s)]
*  but what it had not stopped was what was in the pipeline committed by the Biden administration. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXH49NQbw_c&t=44.36s)]
*  The Biden administration, as we know, had committed about $66 billion worth of equipment from current [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXH49NQbw_c&t=49.64s)]
*  Defense Department stocks and in contracts for defense industry to make weapons for Ukraine. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXH49NQbw_c&t=56.08s)]
*  This pause now stops all of that. There have been shipments to Ukraine since the Trump [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXH49NQbw_c&t=61.64s)]
*  administration came to office because not everything that Biden's administration committed [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXH49NQbw_c&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  can make it over there quickly, like vehicles. Vehicles sometimes may take months to get over [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXH49NQbw_c&t=73.64s)]
*  to Ukraine. What the Trump administration had been doing was just letting that go, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXH49NQbw_c&t=80.56s)]
*  letting that go to Ukraine without committing anything more. Now, it appears that the Trump [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXH49NQbw_c&t=84.72s)]
*  administration has stopped all aid from flowing to Ukraine. As you saw this news coming in, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXH49NQbw_c&t=90.72s)]
*  what significance did it bring up for you? This is a clear message to Ukraine that the Trump [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXH49NQbw_c&t=95.6s)]
*  administration is moving the line just a little bit more to try and get Ukraine to the negotiating [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXH49NQbw_c&t=105.16s)]
*  table, to get Ukraine to agree with some of what President Trump is saying for peace. The passive [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXH49NQbw_c&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  flow of aid had not been touched. We're more than a month into the Trump administration, and for all [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXH49NQbw_c&t=117.08s)]
*  the criticism President Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance gave the Biden administration during [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXH49NQbw_c&t=123.4s)]
*  the campaign, they had not touched what was flowing already to Ukraine when they got into office. Now, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXH49NQbw_c&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  that has changed and remains to be seen how quickly that will affect the Ukrainians on the battlefield. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXH49NQbw_c&t=134.8s)]
