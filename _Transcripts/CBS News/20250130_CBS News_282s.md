# Pilot reacts to D.C. plane crash
**CBS News:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4)
*  Let's bring in Captain Mike Cofield for more on this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=0.0s)]
*  He has a principle for coast to coast strategies [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=3.34s)]
*  and a retired veteran of the airline industry [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=5.46s)]
*  with more than 30 years of commercial experience. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  Captain, thank you for being with us [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=10.58s)]
*  on such a somber day for our country. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=12.44s)]
*  What is your initial reaction [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  and early assessment based on what we know? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=16.4s)]
*  Well, first of all, thoughts and prayers [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=20.64s)]
*  go out to those families. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=22.06s)]
*  I spent 31 years with United flying over 22,000 hours. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=23.5s)]
*  One thing that I thought of initially [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=29.06s)]
*  as I looked at my wife and my kids, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=32.26s)]
*  my grandkids today was that it was really important [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=34.06s)]
*  when I said hello, when I said goodbye. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=38.14s)]
*  Those crews, every day when they go to work [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=40.7s)]
*  and when they come home, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=43.34s)]
*  their families are impacted dramatically. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=45.54s)]
*  And it kind of came back home to us [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=48.54s)]
*  and especially as we run our current airline KM cargo. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=51.78s)]
*  The helicopter was where it was supposed to be [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=57.78s)]
*  in terms of the route. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=62.980000000000004s)]
*  I think there is some conversation relative to the fact [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=65.78s)]
*  that there were aircraft lining up to land to the north [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=68.58s)]
*  and as they do, unruly one zero. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=74.14s)]
*  Some of the regional jets have an opportunity [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=78.34s)]
*  given to them as long as traffic available [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=80.86s)]
*  to do a half circle route into runway three three. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=83.22s)]
*  It's done with smaller aircraft, our regional jets [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=86.86s)]
*  and I don't believe that the helicopter [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=90.62s)]
*  or the airliner saw either each other at all. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=94.14s)]
*  And you just mentioned to what the president has spoken of. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=100.42s)]
*  I think they're gonna go back and look at ATC training. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=104.3s)]
*  When those red lights are on, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=108.42s)]
*  that's actually an alert [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=109.66s)]
*  that the controller is seeing on his screen. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=111.30000000000001s)]
*  But he's also looking out the window of the cab or the tower. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=113.58s)]
*  Now, I think they used to be, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=118.38000000000001s)]
*  you would go to Oklahoma city to the training center [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=121.62s)]
*  and you'd spend four months, five months [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=123.78s)]
*  in training in Oklahoma city. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=126.66000000000001s)]
*  And then you would go to a facility like, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=128.26s)]
*  to give you an example, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=131.26s)]
*  maybe Leesburg or a smaller Knoxville, Tennessee. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=132.1s)]
*  You go to a smaller airport [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=137.18s)]
*  and then get trained to be qualified at a larger facility. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=139.46s)]
*  That's not what's been occurred over the last few years. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=143.5s)]
*  What's happened is they've shortened the time [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=146.26000000000002s)]
*  in Oklahoma city and they've actually demanded [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=148.58s)]
*  or made training available at the local facility [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=152.26000000000002s)]
*  where a senior ATC person within do training on the job, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=155.70000000000002s)]
*  so to speak. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  I've always thought that, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=161.78s)]
*  especially over the last 10 years or so, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=163.18s)]
*  that that's really not a very good plan, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=165.10000000000002s)]
*  that they ought to go back to the original plan. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=167.34s)]
*  Captain, it's been six years [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=169.46s)]
*  since the last sort of collision like this happened. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=170.70000000000002s)]
*  How rare is something like this? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=173.46s)]
*  Well, in the United States, it's almost, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=176.42000000000002s)]
*  it almost never happens. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=179.3s)]
*  I mean, if you think about, you know, 31 years, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=180.4s)]
*  I mean, there's only a handful of opportunities, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  times that something like this happened. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=186.82s)]
*  Now, overseas, you know, you had the Korean incident [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=188.5s)]
*  just eight weeks ago, but domestic travel [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=191.86s)]
*  in the United States is incredibly safe. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=195.26s)]
*  Professional aviators, you know, professional maintenance, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=197.78s)]
*  no shortcuts, safety's first, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=201.54s)]
*  and no questions to the captain if it's not safe. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=204.86s)]
*  So I think those are things that are true. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=208.18s)]
*  I just don't think that, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=211.54s)]
*  and one of the things I'm gonna communicate back [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=213.46s)]
*  to the NTSB and especially to Senator Jerry Moran [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=216.36s)]
*  and an aside to that is that he is the new chairman [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=220.14s)]
*  of the Commerce Aviation Subcommittee, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=223.38s)]
*  and he is from Kansas. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=226.66s)]
*  And he's also the most knowledgeable aviation expert [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=228.42000000000002s)]
*  in the United States Congress. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=232.06s)]
*  I mean, he's, and he's got a heart that's unbelievable. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=233.26s)]
*  So that's good news. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=235.74s)]
*  And the history of Kansas relative to aviation, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=237.62s)]
*  my dad, B-29 was made in Kansas. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=240.34s)]
*  Aviation is ingrained in that region. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=246.18s)]
*  So I think there are some good things [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=249.48000000000002s)]
*  that are gonna come out of this. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=252.5s)]
*  We hope that the president chooses [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=253.7s)]
*  and encourages the chair of the board of the NTSB [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=255.66s)]
*  to handle this in the GO team. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=260.34s)]
*  I don't know what they've decided yet this morning, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=262.02s)]
*  this afternoon, but it's my hope [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=264.42s)]
*  that the chairman takes over this [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=266.22s)]
*  since DCA is owned by the federal government [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=268.3s)]
*  and Congress is responsible. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=271.5s)]
*  All right, well, Captain Mike Koval, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=273.26s)]
*  we have to leave it there today, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=274.3s)]
*  but hopefully we can have you back on [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=275.38s)]
*  to discuss this tragedy. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=276.98s)]
*  Thank you for your time, sir. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=278.1s)]
*  Sure, thank you so much. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBn9MqTnqN4&t=279.98s)]
