Video Description: While President Trump insists he won't touch Medicaid, his agenda in Congress tells a very different story. The House is set to vote on a spending plan that could cut Medicaid funding by hundreds of billions of dollars to offset Trump's proposed tax cuts. New Mexico Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham joins "America Decides" to discuss how the potential cuts could impact healthcare in her state.

# Gov. Lujan Grisham sounds alarm on Medicaid cuts in House GOP budget plan
**CBS News:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg)
*  Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=0.0s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=2.84s)]
*  I want you to... [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=3.84s)]
*  You don't have to. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=4.84s)]
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=5.84s)]
*  If you're listening carefully, you just heard President Trump say Medicaid is not going [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=6.84s)]
*  to be touched. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=11.8s)]
*  However, the House Republicans have a plan, which the president has endorsed, that would [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=12.8s)]
*  cut some $880 billion from Medicaid over the next 10 years. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=17.48s)]
*  This is partial cost savings to finance an extension of the existing Trump tax cuts. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=23.82s)]
*  New Mexico Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham joins me now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=30.3s)]
*  Governor, it's great to see you. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=33.42s)]
*  I mentioned the top line number, $880 billion over 10 years. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=34.78s)]
*  Looking at the data, New Mexico is the largest recipient state for Medicaid assistance. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=38.94s)]
*  33% of your population, as I understand it, receives either Medicaid or CHIP subsidies. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=44.94s)]
*  What do these cuts look like to you, Governor? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=52.52s)]
*  Well, it means that more than 800,000 New Mexicans would be under or uninsured completely, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  so we ripped those health care benefits. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=63.88s)]
*  For viewers, CHIP is the Children's Health Insurance Program. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=66.52000000000001s)]
*  That's 313,000 New Mexicans. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=69.80000000000001s)]
*  But here's really the issue that I think far too many Americans and maybe some New Mexicans [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=73.80000000000001s)]
*  are unaware of. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=80.14s)]
*  This cut is actually a health care tariff to everybody else. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=81.76s)]
*  That means your insurance premiums go up. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=85.52s)]
*  That means your copays go up. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=87.96s)]
*  That means Medicare covers less. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=90.06s)]
*  That means your prescription drug costs go up. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=92.36s)]
*  That means nobody has primary care docs, because all of this health care investment is all [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=94.98s)]
*  connected. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=101.12s)]
*  We're already losing hundreds of rural hospitals every year. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=102.12s)]
*  Nursing homes are closing. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=107.12s)]
*  Assisted livings are closing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=108.72s)]
*  We're on waiting lists with disabilities for care. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=110.4s)]
*  It's all connected. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=113.84s)]
*  This is devastating to America's health care system, and I hope that Republicans in Congress, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  frankly, come to their senses. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=124.44000000000001s)]
*  It is another example where President Trump says one thing and then does exactly the opposite. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=127.12s)]
*  He's not reducing costs. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=135.56s)]
*  He's increasing costs, and people will die and just be sicker. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=138.12s)]
*  And for the wealthiest country in the world, how sad is it that this is the place that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=143.56s)]
*  we would go to try to finance tax cuts? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=148.32s)]
*  And, Governor, if I hear you correctly, what you're saying is if these reductions in the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=151.28s)]
*  growth of Medicaid go through, it will be a cost shifting to those who are not involved [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  in Medicaid at all. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=161.08s)]
*  Walk me through that, exactly what you mean by that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=162.08s)]
*  Well, because Medicaid and Medicare pay, are the largest payers together. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=164.8s)]
*  Medicare's the largest payer. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  That's how hospitals stay afloat. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=171.48000000000002s)]
*  So if you lose all that money in a practice, or surgeons lose all that, or clinics lose [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=173.84s)]
*  all that, or independent practices, because that's no longer available, you can't keep [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=180.96s)]
*  your doors open unless you cover that with making premiums and copays for everybody else [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=186.7s)]
*  go up. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=196.5s)]
*  So I don't think enough people are talking about that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=198.22s)]
*  This absolutely would be the most expensive tariff, and it would go directly to Americans. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=201.39999999999998s)]
*  Companies would have to pay more for their employees. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=209.33999999999997s)]
*  All businesses would not be able to offer health insurance as a benefit, and more practices [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=212.18s)]
*  in America will close. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=218.22s)]
*  By 2030, already, with all of this money going in, we're going to have 5,000. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=220.46s)]
*  That's going to be the shortage for OBGYNs. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=227.5s)]
*  In rural America, we don't have obstetrics. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=230.74s)]
*  You have to drive hundreds of miles to see an obstetrician. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=234.44s)]
*  Think about what that does to most Americans all across the country. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=239.42000000000002s)]
*  It literally rips a healthcare rug right out from underneath their feet. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=245.34s)]
*  Governor, as you know, in your state, the Medicaid reimbursement or the budget ratio [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=251.66s)]
*  is 83 percent, as I saw recent data, from the federal government, 17 percent from New [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=258.22s)]
*  Mexico. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=263.98s)]
*  Other states are 21, 25, some up to 30 percent. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=265.5s)]
*  Why is the ratio so out of balance? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=269.18s)]
*  Question one. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=271.38s)]
*  And question two, if these cuts do come, could your state budget fill up some of that gap? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=272.38s)]
*  Well, my state budget is also quite heavy on the Medicaid side, and part of that is [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=276.78000000000003s)]
*  because, which is a little wonky. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=283.26s)]
*  So, one part isn't. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=285.58s)]
*  Part one, New Mexico has a deeper poverty rate than most states, and some of the other [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=287.7s)]
*  high-poverty states did not elect to provide healthcare to their citizens. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=294.24s)]
*  We did. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=299.52s)]
*  And most other states aren't encouraging more healthcare delivery. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=301.2s)]
*  The healthier you are, the more access you have, the lower costs become. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=306.26s)]
*  So what we've been doing here is investing heavily. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=312.48s)]
*  So I build clinics. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  I pay for all of the upfront costs. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=317.24s)]
*  And we've increased our Medicaid rate. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=321.68s)]
*  So that's the wonky part. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=326.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=328.2s)]
*  That means the federal government also pays down a higher share here. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=329.2s)]
*  Why would we do that? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=332.16s)]
*  Well, Medicare pays the lowest rates in New Mexico, which is where you have a little bit [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=333.16s)]
*  of movement in healthcare financing. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=340.46000000000004s)]
*  If you don't get a high enough Medicare rate, you lose money on private insurance and on [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=343.52s)]
*  which means nobody can afford to be in business. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=349.12s)]
*  That's an old rate problem done in the 60s. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=352.32000000000005s)]
*  Maybe you and I can talk about that another time. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=355.8s)]
*  That's 30 minutes at least. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=358.24s)]
*  But we were penalized, I think, thinking that New Mexico is never going to grow in population, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=360.28000000000003s)]
*  or I don't know what the thinking was. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=365.92s)]
*  But in any event, you have to make it up in Medicaid, and we do. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=367.96000000000004s)]
*  That means the state also pays much more in those rates. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  And I don't think that 70% average is exactly right, and it might account for some of the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=377.32s)]
*  other direct general fund. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=382.48s)]
*  But basically, it's a 25-75 split. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  So the federal government pays the lion's share. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=389.0s)]
*  And that's part of their commitment to invest in a healthcare system that benefits everybody [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=394.08s)]
*  else. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=400.32s)]
*  One other thing I want to talk to you about, Governor, is the Department of Government [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=401.32s)]
*  efficiency cuts to the federal workforce. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=404.76s)]
*  I saw two different figures for New Mexico, about 23,000 federal employees and 29,000 [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  federal employees. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=412.48s)]
*  Nevertheless, there have been cuts already to the Forest Service and the Park Service. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=413.48s)]
*  What's happening in New Mexico? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=418.08s)]
*  Well, I think you're seeing that happen all over the country. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=419.56s)]
*  There is a lot of confusion and fear. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=423.92s)]
*  One of our parks, Carlsbad Caverns, which is a national park, is operating with 50% [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=429.36s)]
*  less staff. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=434.92s)]
*  We've gotten commitments from some cabinet secretaries that that's going to get fixed. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=435.92s)]
*  But let's also talk about why, again, New Mexico has so many federal employees. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=440.12s)]
*  Well, we run two of the five national defense labs. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=444.84000000000003s)]
*  That means that the nuclear weapons research, maintenance programs, and all of those efforts [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=451.68s)]
*  all happen here. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=458.72s)]
*  These are not the employees that you want not coming to work every day. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=461.36s)]
*  I think this whole thing with a wrecking ball, employees, Medicaid, these huge shifts in [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=466.96000000000004s)]
*  what you're trying to accomplish in terms or in the name of efficiency are actually [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=474.2s)]
*  very risky and very problematic. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=479.92s)]
*  This is a state that invented nuclear medicine. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=484.56s)]
*  This is the state that figured out nuclear weapons industry. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=487.48s)]
*  This is a state where these federal workers have an incredibly important international [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  footprint. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=498.08000000000004s)]
*  And to just say 50% of you should go home is reckless. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=499.48s)]
*  So we're seeing it play out in people needing uninsurance benefits, their spouses trying [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1f7Wm2VkSg&t=504.32000000000005s)]
