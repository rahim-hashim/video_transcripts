# Former USAID official reacts to agency overhaul
**CBS News:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk)
*  As we've been reporting, there's been a major shakeup within the government organization [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=0.0s)]
*  that oversees foreign aid, and it's raising questions about its future. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=4.32s)]
*  U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News Monday the U.S. Agency for International Development, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=7.92s)]
*  or USAID, would be absorbed by the State Department as part of President Trump and Elon Musk's [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  efforts to overhaul the federal government. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Musk has accused the USAID specifically of being politically partisan and supporting [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=19.72s)]
*  anti-American causes, and the president said it was run by, quote, radicals. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=23.96s)]
*  But what exactly is the agency and what is its purpose? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=29.2s)]
*  President John F. Kennedy established USAID in 1961 to improve the administration of U.S. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=32.2s)]
*  economic assistance. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=37.12s)]
*  It oversees humanitarian, development, and security programs in more than 120 countries. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=38.72s)]
*  Some of those programs include disaster relief and fighting food insecurity and disease. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=43.96s)]
*  The agency manages more than $40 billion in funding, which makes up less than 1 percent [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=48.36s)]
*  of the federal budget. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=53.1s)]
*  USAID also employs around 10,000 workers worldwide. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  For more, let's bring in Dr. Atul Gawande. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  He's a surgeon and former head of global health at USAID. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=60.08s)]
*  Dr., thanks for being here. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=62.92s)]
*  What is your response to this overhaul, and what are you hearing from your former colleagues? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=64.64s)]
*  Well, it's not an overhaul. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  It's a destruction, and you have to understand that. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=70.72s)]
*  It started a week ago with the so-called pause in funding. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=72.92s)]
*  This shut down all activities, lifesaving health work, disaster relief, and so on. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=76.8s)]
*  It's like, as a surgeon, I know you can't stop an operation midway through the operation [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  and say, we'll be back in 90 days. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=87.12s)]
*  And that's what we've done. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=89.56s)]
*  I oversaw the goal of health work, and you're talking about 20 million people in the global [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=91.36s)]
*  HIV program that has reduced HIV around the world. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  They are going without medication that keeps them alive. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=100.64s)]
*  You're talking about disease outbreaks that are not being stopped, like bird flu, where [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=103.88s)]
*  monitoring has been turned off for 49 countries. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=109.48s)]
*  There is a great deal of harm being done. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=112.96s)]
*  And this change to take away the independent status is just a nail in the coffin after [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=116.88s)]
*  a purge of personnel that has decimated the agency. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  At the beginning of our show, we had Weijia Jiang say that the White House is sending out [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=128.2s)]
*  a fact sheet on some of the reasons why they're doing this, and they point to allocations [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  for gender reassignment surgery or transhealth care in some of these nations that they're [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=136.2s)]
*  opposed to. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=141.4s)]
*  Millions of dollars being spent, which our Ed O'Keefe does recognize and point out that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=142.4s)]
*  it is a small part of the budget. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=146.04000000000002s)]
*  Do you have any reaction to that in terms of the president saying that this is run by [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=148.0s)]
*  radical people and Secretary of State Rubio, who says that the whole point of USAID is [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  to further national interest? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=157.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=160.0s)]
*  I mean, the people doing this work have been compared by Musk to being worms and being [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=161.0s)]
*  called radical leftists. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=166.52s)]
*  And what we're talking about are disaster relief workers. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=169.88s)]
*  We're talking about health workers and people who are doing good and protecting America [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=172.76s)]
*  around the world. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=178.32s)]
*  And it's dangerous for the country to denigrate this. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=179.32s)]
*  You know, it's our most it's our largest civilian operational capacity for advancing our work [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=183.36s)]
*  for the U.S. abroad. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=190.12s)]
*  And I'll just say around the you know, every administration goes through an overhaul that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=192.86s)]
*  says they want to change policy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=198.4s)]
*  They want to change some direction. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=200.2s)]
*  But you don't decimate and demolish the institution in the process. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  There was no need to have closed out all of its functions, which is harming people. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=208.16s)]
*  You know, this is an agency that touches hundreds of millions of people around the world, and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=214.92s)]
*  the damage is accumulating by the day. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=219.0s)]
*  You reshared a post by Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware who said, quote, eliminating [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  and undercutting America's role in international assistance makes Americans less safe. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=226.88s)]
*  How so? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=231.28s)]
*  Well, it's a gift to Russia and China, who actually are cheering the work of Doge, the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=232.28s)]
*  government efficiency work where it's not efficiency to destroy capacity. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=241.4s)]
*  You know, we're talking about world class expertise. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=249.0s)]
*  For example, the malaria program, two thirds have been fired and the activity shut down. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=252.44000000000003s)]
*  It includes one of the global experts in malaria for us. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=260.68s)]
*  How does that make us safer? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=265.40000000000003s)]
*  How does that make us stronger? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  Dr. Ajul Gawande, thank you for your time. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=268.48s)]
*  We hope you'll come back. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=272.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRGQ6qaFuwk&t=273.0s)]
