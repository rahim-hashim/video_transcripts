*  is sweeping through the South, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=5.76s)]
*  that's or bringing dangerous cold [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=7.68s)]
*  and potentially record breaking [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=9.48s)]
*  snowfall to states that rarely [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  see this kind of harsh winter weather. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  The cold snap is also impacting [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=15.72s)]
*  travelers and according to FlightAware, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=17.98s)]
*  there are more than 400 flights [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=20.04s)]
*  delayed and over 350 canceled [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=22.12s)]

*  canceled so far today. CBS News reporter [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=32.08s)]
*  Katie Weiss joins us now live from [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=34.2s)]
*  New Orleans Katie. You don't see [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=36.6s)]
*  this very often. Even a flurry [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=38.52s)]
*  is rare where you're standing. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=40.4s)]
*  Now the city is under a blizzard [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  morning looks like you're standing [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=44.32s)]
*  in the middle of the blizzard. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=46.08s)]
*  What's it like where you're standing? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=48.08s)]
*  Yes, Liz, I gotta say as someone who [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=52.64s)]
*  grew up here in the Gulf Coast region, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=55.24s)]
*  it's not any ordinary day. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=58.12s)]
*  That is for sure. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  You know, we we know that the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=61.32s)]
*  Lake Charles area is under a blizzard [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=63.72s)]
*  warning for the first time ever in history, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=66.28s)]
*  so certainly an historic event this [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=69.16s)]
*  afternoon in New Orleans in the Bayou [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=71.36s)]
*  State and for many southern areas [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=73.92s)]
*  across the Gulf Coast. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=76.08s)]
*  We also know that just minutes ago [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=77.52s)]
*  a city councilman Councilman Walker [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=80.1s)]
*  just posted on X that the New Orleans [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=82.47999999999999s)]
*  airport has shut down that the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=86.56s)]
*  front entrance doors are closed [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=88.56s)]
*  to the airport at this hour. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=90.4s)]
*  That's pretty impressive to hear. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  So some huge travel impacts to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=94.36s)]
*  many people across the region, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=96.28s)]
*  whether they're flying or trying to drive around. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=98.16s)]
*  I saw some drivers on the roads [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  just a little bit ago, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  driving very slowly and cautiously. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=104.44s)]
*  But here at at this rooftop area [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  where I'm set up, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=110.92s)]
*  I've been talking with some of my neighbors [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  and some folks who live here who [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=114.52s)]
*  have been sheltering in place, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  heeding the warnings to not get out on the roads. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=117.72s)]
*  And I'm going to bring some of those folks in here. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=121.0s)]
*  Now we have Ian and Daisha Spooner. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=123.36s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=126.0s)]
*  How are you guys enjoying this [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=127.16s)]
*  very unusual weather event? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=129.24s)]
*  It's like winter wonderland. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=131.2s)]
*  My wife just mentioned snow. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=133.2s)]
*  So I love that snow. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=135.0s)]
*  This is pretty. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=139.84s)]
*  This is pretty awesome. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=140.44s)]
*  I'm being born and raised in Louisiana. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, can count on one hand how many times it snowed [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=143.88s)]
*  and it's never snowed like this. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=146.84s)]
*  Never like this. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=147.88s)]
*  This is unprecedented for sure. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=148.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  Are you what are you going to be doing anything [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=151.92s)]
*  to commence or celebrate this this historic day? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=153.68s)]
*  Eating some good food, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=157.68s)]
*  maybe make a pot of gumbo, something like that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=159.32s)]
*  Yeah, that sounds about right. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=161.6s)]
*  Good New Orleans way to celebrate the winter weather. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=163.28s)]
*  And here I have my other neighbor [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=165.76s)]
*  who is in law school right now. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=167.28s)]
*  We have Josh Buxbaum. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=168.96s)]
*  Josh, what do you think about this? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=170.2s)]
*  I think I saw you actually making a snow angel earlier. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=171.68s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=175.24s)]
*  When in Rome, right? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=176.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  Had to do it, but it's just been so much fun. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  Never get to experience this here. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=181.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=183.44s)]
*  Have you ever, you said you grew up in Houston. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=184.28s)]
*  Have you ever seen anything quite like this? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=185.84s)]
*  I was in Austin during the big storm in 2021. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=188.08s)]
*  So this is my second time seeing big snow in the area, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=192.28s)]
*  but first time here in New Orleans. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=195.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  Pretty impressive. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=199.32s)]
*  Any advice for people who might be watching [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=200.24s)]
*  in the South right now? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=203.0s)]
*  Just enjoy it and don't take it too seriously. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=205.4s)]
*  It's snow, it's good times, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=208.92s)]
*  and we're not in the Northeast, so we can enjoy it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=211.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=213.72s)]
*  And that's a very good point. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=214.56s)]
*  We're not in the Northeast. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=216.04s)]
*  We have a lot of snowfall accumulation [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=217.76s)]
*  that this region just isn't used to. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=220.92s)]
*  And so there are city leaders [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=223.16s)]
*  don't really have the kind of infrastructure [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=225.28s)]
*  to be able to handle snowfall like this. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=228.12s)]
*  So certainly an unusual day, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=230.8s)]
*  whether you're trying to stay safe or stay warm. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=234.24s)]
*  But you gotta love the people in New Orleans there, Katie. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=238.12s)]
*  They always have a way to look at the bright side of things. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=240.4s)]
*  That couple you interviewed, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=243.44s)]
*  they're gonna make a big old pot of gumbo. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=244.52s)]
*  They're just gonna ride it out. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=246.28s)]
*  So that's a good attitude to have, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  because what else are you gonna do? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=248.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, New Orleans is known for being a party. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=253.76s)]
*  It's not going to be a party [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=256.28s)]
*  that maybe is out on Bourbon Street this day. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=257.88s)]
*  But yeah, a pot of gumbo is a great way to stay warm. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  I love that attitude. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  All right, Katie Weiss joining us live [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=266.23999999999995s)]
*  from a very snowy New Orleans. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=268.08s)]
*  It is so bizarre, Jess, to see her standing there [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=270.35999999999996s)]
*  with the snow just dumping down. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  You're thinking, oh, she must be in Idaho or something. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=275.52s)]
*  And you know, she just made the comment too. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  She's like, maybe not a party out on Bourbon Street. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=279.28s)]
*  They're gonna party on Bourbon Street. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=281.0s)]
*  You know that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=282.55999999999995s)]
*  Please, wear your snow jacket. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=283.4s)]
*  I love how they call it snow-la. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=286.32s)]
*  Snow-la. Snow-la. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=287.64s)]
*  Yeah, you know, and it's a fun approach [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=289.08s)]
*  to what's really going on throughout that region, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=290.52000000000004s)]
*  because I mean, from Houston all the way [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=292.24s)]
*  over into the Carolinas today, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=293.8s)]
*  we are seeing snow in the forecast for us, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVGHUkbxjU&t=295.0s)]
