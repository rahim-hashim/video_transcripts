# Macron joins G7 call from the White House
**CBS News:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0)
*  Back here in the United States, French President Emmanuel Macron left just the White House [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=0.0s)]
*  just moments ago after joining the G7 summit by phone. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=5.4s)]
*  Macron is set to head back to the United States, the White House rather, later this afternoon [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=9.48s)]
*  for a meeting with President Trump. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=14.52s)]
*  We know France released a statement ahead of that visit expressing its goal to end Russian [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=16.76s)]
*  aggression against Ukraine. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=23.04s)]
*  The palace said in part, quote, he is traveling to Washington with this goal in mind, sharing [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=25.24s)]
*  this desire to end the conflict while making every effort to maintain our support for Ukraine, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=31.4s)]
*  strengthen European security and ensure Ukraine is fully involved in these efforts, and also [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=37.76s)]
*  to ensure that Ukraine's interests, which are ours as well, are fully taken into account. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=43.56s)]
*  Now just last week, European allies held an emergency meeting to discuss how the union [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=49.36s)]
*  will respond to the war in Ukraine without the continued support of the United States. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=55.84s)]
*  The Trump administration made it clear it has plans to limit spending to NATO and will [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=61.64s)]
*  not put troops on the ground in Ukraine for peacekeeping efforts. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=66.64s)]
*  CBS News Chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes is joining us now. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=70.64s)]
*  For more on this, Nancy, thanks for being here on a Monday. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=74.84s)]
*  What's on the table today for these two? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=78.48s)]
*  Hey, Mugo, good to see you. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=83.04s)]
*  So that phone call that you just referenced between President Trump and Emmanuel Macron [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  and the G7 leaders just wrapped up a short time ago. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=90.64s)]
*  It lasted about two hours. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=94.08000000000001s)]
*  We're awaiting a readout from White House officials. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=95.68s)]
*  But President Macron, because he's here, came to the White House pretty early this morning [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=100.84s)]
*  and was with President Trump in the Oval Office as they conducted that call. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=104.8s)]
*  And it was heavily focused on Ukraine. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=110.24s)]
*  We know that in particular because a lot of Western leaders are actually in Ukraine today, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=112.4s)]
*  participated in the call from Ukraine. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=118.24s)]
*  Justin Trudeau, for example, of Canada. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=120.24s)]
*  Canada is one of the G7 nations. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=122.8s)]
*  He is in Ukraine to mark the three-year anniversary of the Russian invasion. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=124.56s)]
*  And so it's likely that Ukraine was the dominant topic of discussion. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=129.2s)]
*  As Macron was leaving the White House to go back across the street to Blair House, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=134.16s)]
*  he spoke very briefly to reporters. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=138.64s)]
*  He said it was a perfect phone call, perhaps adopting some of President Trump's rhetoric [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=140.72s)]
*  because he is here at the White House today. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=146.48s)]
*  He said he got a great welcome, very, very friendly from President Trump, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  despite the fact that they are at odds at the moment about how to try to bring an end [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=153.2s)]
*  to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=158.8s)]
*  And then a couple hours from now, Macron is going to come back across the street from [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  Blair House, go back into the Oval Office to meet one-on-one with President Trump. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=166.4s)]
*  And then after that, they are going to be taking questions from reporters. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=170.96s)]
*  So it'll be a really important opportunity to get a sense of whether having these two men meet [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=174.88s)]
*  face-to-face perhaps has brought them a little closer together on the issue of Ukraine, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=182.72s)]
*  because right now President Trump does appear to be at odds with most European allies [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=188.64s)]
*  when it comes to the conflict there. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=193.2s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  And all of this comes as the U.S. continues to push Ukraine to sign a minerals deal. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=195.92s)]
*  President Zelensky says progress has been made. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=200.88s)]
*  Can you walk us through what's going on here? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=203.83999999999997s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=207.6s)]
*  So Ukraine is blessed with significant stores of raw materials, things like graphite and lithium [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  that are used to make all kinds of batteries. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=216.24s)]
*  It's got deposits of all kinds of rare earth minerals that are used to make everything [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=219.12s)]
*  from weaponry to electronics. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=224.16s)]
*  And the U.S. would love to have more access to those rare earth materials because it would [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  enable the U.S. to rely less heavily on China. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=232.08s)]
*  But some of the initial offers that were made by the Trump administration were fairly extreme, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=235.52s)]
*  demanding, for example, a 50-50 revenue sharing operation with Ukraine. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=241.92s)]
*  And Zelensky said basically that would mean handing his country over to the Americans. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=250.0s)]
*  But now the two sides have been talking and it appears that the terms have become a little [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  less aggressive because now Ukrainian officials say they actually think they are nearing an [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=263.12s)]
*  agreement and could have something ready to be signed quite soon. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=268.56s)]
*  Okay. Looks like some progress there. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  Nancy Cordes from the White House, thank you so much as always for your reporting. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXf4-KgYf0&t=274.72s)]
