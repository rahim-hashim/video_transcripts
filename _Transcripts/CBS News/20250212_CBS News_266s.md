# Inflation hotter than expected in January, consumer price index shows
**CBS News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc)
*  All right, we want to start, though, with the latest inflation data that's coming into [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=0.0s)]
*  the CBS News broadcast center, and it came in much hotter than expected. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=4.12s)]
*  The consumer price index rose by half a percent in January and is up 3 percent over the last [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=8.16s)]
*  year. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=14.56s)]
*  The CPI, of course, is the key gauge the Federal Reserve weighs on making decisions on interest [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=15.56s)]
*  rates. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=18.98s)]
*  And you can see the markets are not liking it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=19.98s)]
*  The Dow is down already 300 points, and it's just the beginning of the morning. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=21.92s)]
*  Meanwhile, this morning, President Trump posted on his True Social account that interest rates [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=25.28s)]
*  should be lowered, which could go hand in hand with those upcoming tariffs, adding let's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=29.42s)]
*  rock and roll America. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=34.82s)]
*  CBS News Money Watch correspondent Kelly O'Grade is here with me in Studio 55. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=37.42s)]
*  Good to see you, Kelly. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=41.18s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=42.18s)]
*  Inflation rising 3 percent. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=43.18s)]
*  Numbers not looking good. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=46.34s)]
*  The price of food is up. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=47.34s)]
*  The price of manufacturing is up. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=48.44s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=51.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=52.5s)]
*  So the fact that we hit 3 percent, I feel like this was kind of that psychological barrier [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=53.5s)]
*  of, okay, we are getting further and further away from the Fed's 2 percent target. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=57.699999999999996s)]
*  We actually thought we were going to see a little bit of easing, so that's why you're [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=61.98s)]
*  seeing the markets react so voluntarily to this news. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=65.32s)]
*  The increases came from food, shelter, and energy. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=71.3s)]
*  I mean, these are the need to have, not the nice to have. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=73.66s)]
*  The one highlight, because I always like to come with a little bit of good news, is that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=77.22s)]
*  rent prices are increasing slower than they were. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=80.94s)]
*  So that's good for renters out there. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=84.5s)]
*  You might start to see a little bit of relief if you're renewing any time soon. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=86.06s)]
*  But I know you always ask me this question. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=90.10000000000001s)]
*  What does this mean for interest rates? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=91.94s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=93.42s)]
*  Even more certain than I was last week. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=94.42s)]
*  We are not going to get cut. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=95.78s)]
*  And so that goes against what the president is looking for. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=96.9s)]
*  So, right. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=99.10000000000001s)]
*  So the president suggesting on his true social, he's seen the same numbers, probably not liking [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=100.10000000000001s)]
*  it because what he campaigned on is bringing inflation down. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=103.66s)]
*  What you heard, people who were voting for Donald Trump saying during the campaign is [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=106.82000000000001s)]
*  that they were worried about inflation. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=110.66s)]
*  Although it had been down since June of last year. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=113.46s)]
*  Before that, President Biden had dealt with some high inflationary pressures. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=116.62s)]
*  They were voting for Donald Trump to bring inflation down. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=119.7s)]
*  It's rising. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=122.62s)]
*  The president wants a rate cut. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=123.62s)]
*  Probably not going to get it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=124.62s)]
*  Definitely not going to get it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=125.62s)]
*  What's tough about this is, yes, he just took office. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=127.86s)]
*  This was the January CPI. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=130.26s)]
*  So a lot of this data is actually from before him taking office. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=132.18s)]
*  And it does take a while. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=136.18s)]
*  He's going to say that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=137.18s)]
*  You know he's going to say. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=138.18s)]
*  It's not me. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=139.18s)]
*  It's the other guy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=140.18s)]
*  He is going to be right in some respects. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=141.22s)]
*  And it is hard to bring prices down immediately. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=142.5s)]
*  That was something that he promised to do. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=144.82s)]
*  But it's just simply not the way the economy works. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=146.14000000000001s)]
*  But yes, we were already expecting to get only two rate cuts from the Federal Reserve [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=149.26000000000002s)]
*  this year. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=153.54000000000002s)]
*  I was just listening to the Bank of America CEO speak moments ago. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=154.54000000000002s)]
*  His modeling says that we may get none. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=158.10000000000002s)]
*  And so Vlad, you add on these potential for tariffs, which could raise prices. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=160.54000000000002s)]
*  That's where you start to get into territory where we're already seeing price growth continue [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=166.02s)]
*  to go up. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=170.34s)]
*  You add on policies that could increase that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=171.34s)]
*  That's where you start to get into rate hike territory if things run away. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=174.78s)]
*  So Kelly, could if the president really wanted to bring interest rate, if he really wanted [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=178.26000000000002s)]
*  to bring inflation down, could he say, you know what, I'm putting a pause on these tariffs? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=183.22s)]
*  In other words, the question will be that I would have and I'm not an economist, but [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=186.66000000000003s)]
*  what can he do now? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=190.82000000000002s)]
*  OK, these numbers are from January. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=192.02s)]
*  You can blame President Biden. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=194.06s)]
*  But what can I do now to ensure that inflation doesn't continue to rise? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=195.54000000000002s)]
*  And if an economist says don't put these tariffs in the place, should he consider that? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=198.78s)]
*  So yes and no, right? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=203.06s)]
*  Because the idea is long term that it could bring prices down if you have better trade [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=205.46s)]
*  relationships with folks because of these tariffs. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=210.94s)]
*  I think the most immediate thing that he suggested would be to focus on energy, because we did [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=213.54000000000002s)]
*  see energy prices ticking up. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=218.98000000000002s)]
*  And if you have more oil flowing into the system, more supply, same demand, you would [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=221.22s)]
*  see prices go down. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=226.3s)]
*  That's it's a tough thing because some of the other producers, like a Saudi Arabia, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=227.9s)]
*  could decide to not produce as much. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=232.42s)]
*  And then it's a supply and demand thing. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=234.3s)]
*  So he doesn't have control over bringing prices down solely himself. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=236.18s)]
*  And he, of course, as we like to point out, doesn't have control over monetary policy. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=240.34s)]
*  That's the Fed, although the president likes to suggest that he does. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=244.1s)]
*  The Fed is not beholden to any political party or office. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=247.34s)]
*  So we'll see how that plays out. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=250.26s)]
*  But I think your prediction is spot on, Kelly. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=251.74s)]
*  Always great to have you in Studio 55. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=253.7s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=255.5s)]
*  Did you like my little walk there? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=256.18s)]
*  I did. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=257.38s)]
*  It was a lovely little L. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=257.85999999999996s)]
*  Thought it was a J. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=261.17999999999995s)]
*  But OK, I'll go with the L. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=262.29999999999995s)]
*  I'll take the L. Kelly, great to have you. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=263.73999999999995s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPaiY1qmodc&t=265.34s)]
