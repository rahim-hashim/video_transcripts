# Netanyahu accuses Hamas of backtracking on parts of ceasefire agreement
**CBS News:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw)
*  Good morning everyone. It is 7am Thursday January 16th and I'm Errol Barnett. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=0.0s)]
*  Right now we're following breaking news. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Hamas of backtracking on some elements of the ceasefire deal announced yesterday. In [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=10.84s)]
*  a statement Netanyahu claimed Hamas was trying to quote extort last minute concessions and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=16.88s)]
*  said his security cabinet which still needs to approve this deal will not convene until [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=22.32s)]
*  mediators confirm Hamas has accepted all elements of the agreement. CBS News foreign correspondent [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=27.2s)]
*  Remy Anosentio is following these developments for us from Tel Aviv today. Remy what can [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=32.76s)]
*  you tell us about this apparent hold up to implementing the significant deal? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=37.28s)]
*  Errol, yes good morning and this news will no doubt be frustrating if not disheartening [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=42.92s)]
*  for so many here in Israel hoping for their loved ones hostages to be released but also [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  in Gaza for the end to this war after now more than 467 days since October 7th of 2023. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=55.4s)]
*  Now walking you through the incidents that have happened we first got word this morning [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=62.28s)]
*  that the cabinet meeting for approval of this deal was delayed. We didn't get any reason [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=68.44s)]
*  as to why but then shortly thereafter the office of Israel's prime minister released [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=73.56s)]
*  a statement saying that Hamas quote had reneged on parts of this deal and their claim at least [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=78.66s)]
*  is to get to extort to extract last minute concessions. Israeli media are now reporting [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=84.24s)]
*  that this has to do with which Palestinian detainees may be released as part of this [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=90.72s)]
*  deal in exchange for Israeli hostages. Apparently the initial agreement was that Israel and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=97.56s)]
*  Hamas did agree that some of these detainees of which there were about 11,000 some of these [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=104.16s)]
*  detainees would be off limits but now it's reported that Hamas wants some kind of if [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=109.68s)]
*  you'll say veto power some kind of final say ostensibly this could mean that they might [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=115.48s)]
*  want higher value detainees to be released potentially potentially past leaders and potential [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=121.36000000000001s)]
*  really future leaders of Hamas but Hamas did come out with a statement just now saying [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  that they are still committed to this deal. No one is saying that this deal has been totally [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=131.84s)]
*  derailed. Talks still do continue. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=136.08s)]
*  There was so much optimism around this on Wednesday, Remy, but also that sense of caution [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=138.52s)]
*  when it came to which Palestinians Israel would release. If this does move through, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=143.6s)]
*  how will it play out? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=150.74s)]
*  Sure. Let's say, let's hope that they get through this part of this impasse. Then here [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=153.74s)]
*  in Israel, it would go through a wider and wider circle of approval. First, it would [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=161.4s)]
*  go to the security cabinet, the war cabinet made up of five ministers. Some of those are [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=167.42s)]
*  far right ministers. One of them we know is against this deal. The national security minister [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=172.5s)]
*  in Amar Ben Gavir. If it survives that and it is expected to, then it would go to the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=178.0s)]
*  full cabinet of which there are about three dozen ministers. If it survives that again [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=183.33999999999997s)]
*  expected to it would then go to the parliament. Israel's Knesset made up of 120 members. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=188.17999999999998s)]
*  So off of that, we would then move ahead to phase one. There are three phases. Phase one would potentially [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=194.08s)]
*  start this Sunday and we could see the release of three, perhaps four female hostages. Now [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=199.56s)]
*  it's unclear what this holdup we're talking about this morning might do, might influence, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=205.84s)]
*  might impact that dateline, that timeline. But from what we understand, the first hostages [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=210.72s)]
*  could be released this Sunday. In exchange, Palestinian detainees potentially by the dozens [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=216.64s)]
*  per each hostage would then be released. Israel's military would move from population centers [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=222.8s)]
*  in the central part of the Gaza Strip towards the perimeters and then potentially aid would [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=229.12s)]
*  be surged into Gaza. But again, we have to get through this first impasse that we've [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=234.4s)]
*  been reporting on whether Hamas and Israel can agree to which Palestinian prisoners might [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=238.12s)]
*  be released. And then it would go to an agreement here in the political realm of Israel and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=244.52s)]
*  then to implementation. I know you'll continue to report on this with updates throughout [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=252.04000000000002s)]
*  the day. Ramey, viewers should stay close for your reporting. Thank you very much. For [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=255.88000000000002s)]
*  more on the U.S. involvement of this deal, let's speak now with CBS News White House [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=259.96000000000004s)]
*  reporter Willie James Inman. Willie, what can you tell us about the joint efforts made [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=263.52s)]
*  by both the Biden and Trump teams to get this far and negotiate this ceasefire deal? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=267.3s)]
*  Hey there, Errol. Well, the details of this negotiation really come down to how closely [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=273.2s)]
*  both teams, the Biden team and the incoming Trump team, worked together behind the scenes [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=280.18s)]
*  to make sure this deal came to fruition. And essentially that meant that President Biden's [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=284.74s)]
*  envoy Brett McGurk to the Middle East worked in tandem with Steve Witkoff. That's the incoming [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=289.90000000000003s)]
*  Middle East envoy that President-elect Trump has appointed for his team. And John Kirby, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=295.78000000000003s)]
*  the National Security Council spokesperson, spoke about this yesterday on America Decides. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=300.7s)]
*  We approach these negotiations as one team. Once President-elect Trump won the election, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=307.21999999999997s)]
*  the president directed us, our team, to reach out to them to make sure that they were fully [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=312.14s)]
*  informed and were coordinated with and involved. And Mr. Witkoff was involved in discussions [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=317.02s)]
*  in the region, in Doha and in Tel Aviv, because we know, the president knew, that it was going [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=323.53999999999996s)]
*  to be up to Mr. Witkoff and the Trump team to implement this. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=329.41999999999996s)]
*  Now, this is important for the two teams to work together because perhaps Hamas could exploit any [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=331.94s)]
*  differences between the Trump and Biden team. So they are presenting a united front here and [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=339.78000000000003s)]
*  making sure that they're on the same page, thus coming to this agreement. But as Remy mentioned, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=345.22s)]
*  this agreement really is just volatile and it really could fall apart. But the hope is [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=350.74s)]
*  that it stays together and those hostages are released, Errol. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=355.78000000000003s)]
*  And Willie, last night, I had the pleasure of being part of our team coverage of President Biden's [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=358.65999999999997s)]
*  farewell address to the nation. He touted accomplishments, but also offered a stern warning. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=362.74s)]
*  Let's listen to that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=369.41999999999996s)]
*  Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=371.53999999999996s)]
*  literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=377.94s)]
*  He detailed that for a number of minutes. What's the significance of that piece of Biden's [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=383.21999999999997s)]
*  outgoing message? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=387.78s)]
*  Yeah, it really is significant. And I was watching your report along with our colleagues late last [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=389.53999999999996s)]
*  night at President Biden taking a pretty big chunk of his speech to talk about the threat of [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=395.02s)]
*  unchecked fact checking, essentially on social media without naming names. He didn't name Mark [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=401.17999999999995s)]
*  Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos or any of the other billionaires, specifically Elon Musk, who have [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=407.38s)]
*  really just grown closer to President-elect Trump. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=413.54s)]
*  But he talked about this decentralized, essentially, or centralized, I should say, oligarchy [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=417.86s)]
*  of tech billionaires controlling information in America. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=424.94s)]
*  He also talked about fact checking on social media. He pushed back against that. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=428.78000000000003s)]
*  That is something that he has come out and enforced and talked about within an exit interviews [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=432.78000000000003s)]
*  in recent days about misinformation spreading rampant in America and how the U.S. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=438.06s)]
*  media landscape is changing as well. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=444.82000000000005s)]
*  So it's really interesting to see President Biden talk about the threats that he sees that [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=446.58000000000004s)]
*  America faces in the future, although he won't be there in that political future. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=451.42s)]
*  He did talk about his 50 year or so career in Washington, D.C., but being more [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=454.62s)]
*  grandiose in terms of the threats that America faces in this important speech that he gave last [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=460.58000000000004s)]
*  night from the Oval Office. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=465.58000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, viewers should certainly listen back to it in case they didn't see it live. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=466.62s)]
*  Willie, thank you very much. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9el5ytFxw&t=470.22s)]
