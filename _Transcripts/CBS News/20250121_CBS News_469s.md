# Former Capitol Police officer calls Trump's Jan. 6 pardons a "slap in the face"
**CBS News:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ)
*  Well, as I just mentioned, one of the dozens of actions [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump took during his first hours in office [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=2.16s)]
*  was to grant clemency to all of the more than 1,500 people [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  charged in the January 6th attack on the Capitol. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=8.48s)]
*  Most were granted full pardons. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  14 people had their sentences commuted, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  including the leader of the far-right group, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=15.68s)]
*  the Oath Keepers, and others convicted [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=17.6s)]
*  of seditious conspiracy. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=19.92s)]
*  The sweeping pardons include the more than 120 people [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=25.04s)]
*  or causing bodily injury to an officer. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=27.2s)]
*  According to the Department of Justice, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=30.0s)]
*  140 members of law enforcement were assaulted that day. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=32.4s)]
*  President Trump was asked Tuesday about the pardons, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=35.68s)]
*  including one for someone who confessed [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=37.6s)]
*  to assaulting a police officer. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=39.68s)]
*  Why does he deserve a pardon? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=42.28s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  Was it a pardon? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=44.64s)]
*  Because we're looking at commutes [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=45.36s)]
*  and we're looking at pardons. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=46.84s)]
*  OK, well, we'll take a look at everything. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=48.28s)]
*  But I can say this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=49.96s)]
*  Murderers today are not even charged. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  You have murderers that aren't charged all over. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=55.56s)]
*  You take a look at what's going on in Philadelphia. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=59.04s)]
*  You take a look at what's going on in LA, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=61.2s)]
*  where people murder people and they don't get charged. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=63.96s)]
*  Former Capitol Police officer Winston Peijon joins me now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=67.16s)]
*  He was on the West Front of the Capitol [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=70.2s)]
*  as rioters tried to violently breach the building [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=71.88s)]
*  on January 6, 2021. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=73.84s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here first. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=76.0s)]
*  Remind us all what you went through that day. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=78.32s)]
*  Yes, thank you, Lindsay. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=82.72s)]
*  I served with the Capitol Police over five years. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=85.12s)]
*  And on January 6 with my riot team, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=87.68s)]
*  I was struck in the face, punched in the face, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=90.24s)]
*  knocked on my back, my baton ripped and stolen from me. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=92.84s)]
*  I was pepper sprayed, nearly stabbed with the flagpole, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  all doing my job, just showing up like I did every day [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=99.12s)]
*  for five years to serve the DC community, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=103.4s)]
*  to serve Capitol Hill, serve our Congress. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=107.08s)]
*  Winston, what was and what is your continuing reaction [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=109.12s)]
*  to President Trump's pardons and commutations [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=112.44s)]
*  for those defendants? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=114.4s)]
*  It is really unfortunate. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=118.44s)]
*  It's disturbing. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=120.28s)]
*  It's such a slap in the face to those of us [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=121.32s)]
*  who literally experienced physical violence that day [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  and to know that these violent criminals, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=126.44s)]
*  these convicted felons are going to be released [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=129.72s)]
*  entirely scot-free with... [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=133.16s)]
*  It just, it means, you know, there's no actual accountability [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=136.2s)]
*  for the crimes that they committed. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=141.28s)]
*  There has just been no justice here. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=142.64s)]
*  How you get a sense of people have forgotten [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  or want to forget about what happened during the campaign [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=147.27999999999997s)]
*  we kept hearing, let's just move on. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  Let's focus on the future. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=151.32s)]
*  Why do you want people to remember? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=153.0s)]
*  Well, I would love to move on. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  I would love to look forward, but unfortunately, you know, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=157.92s)]
*  we, this effectively, you know, one of these first acts [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  that this is what the now administration is prioritizing [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=166.11999999999998s)]
*  is entirely looking back at, you know, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=169.72s)]
*  really kind of a vengeful retribution, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=172.64s)]
*  but, you know, we cannot forget what happened [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=176.27999999999997s)]
*  because we have law enforcement, Capitol police, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=178.92s)]
*  and across this country who are serving every day [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=181.48s)]
*  and, you know, their sacrifices need to be honored. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=183.92s)]
*  And we can't forget what happened on January 6th [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=187.23999999999998s)]
*  because we cannot repeat this. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=190.0s)]
*  We cannot allow political violence to become normalized [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=191.32s)]
*  and become accepted like so many have tried [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  and almost successfully done so already in this country. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=198.88s)]
*  Winston Pajon, we certainly appreciate your time [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=202.67999999999998s)]
*  and your effort to come and speak with us. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=207.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=208.55999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=210.51999999999998s)]
*  CBS News Chief Washington correspondent, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  Major Garrett joins me now. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  Major, from the President's wide reaching conversation [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  with reporters there to all of the actions [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=220.11999999999998s)]
*  that he has taken in the last 36 hours so far as president, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=223.72s)]
*  how would you describe sort of the totality [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  and how unusual or not the number of actions [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=231.84s)]
*  he's taking has been? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=234.68s)]
*  I think one way I would characterize it, Lindsay, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=236.44s)]
*  is campaign rhetoric plus plus plus, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=238.56s)]
*  meaning there were things that then candidate, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=241.84s)]
*  Republican nominee Donald Trump said during the campaign [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=243.84s)]
*  that he has set in motion with these executive actions, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=246.72s)]
*  but he has gone beyond his rhetoric [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=249.28s)]
*  in some of the instances. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  He only a couple of times on the campaign trail [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=253.28s)]
*  said that he would, for example, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=255.52s)]
*  seek to overturn or invalidate the 14th Amendment's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=258.48s)]
*  protection for birthright citizenship, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=262.96s)]
*  something that courts have upheld many years reviewing, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=265.16s)]
*  whether or not that is exactly what it means [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=268.56s)]
*  in the Constitution. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=270.48s)]
*  Well, with one of these executive orders, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=271.8s)]
*  the president has put the entire nation on notice, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=273.84s)]
*  he's going to try to eradicate that longstanding [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=275.88s)]
*  legal interpretation of what the 14th Amendment means. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=278.76s)]
*  That's more than his rhetoric suggested. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=281.56s)]
*  Certainly those around him said that he would go [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=283.84s)]
*  on a case by case basis in terms of January 6th [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=285.72s)]
*  pardons or commutations. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=288.56s)]
*  No, these are sweeping and they're all encompassing. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=290.0s)]
*  And on energy and the environment, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=292.6s)]
*  yes he said drill baby drill, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=295.56s)]
*  yes he said he would do all sorts of things [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=297.16s)]
*  to expand the ability of those in the United States [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=299.52s)]
*  who want to explore for oil or natural gas, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=303.16s)]
*  but by declaring a national emergency there, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=305.96000000000004s)]
*  he's invested in himself larger powers [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=308.0s)]
*  to do that more rapidly. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=310.32s)]
*  So I would say the rhetoric was one thing, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=311.92s)]
*  but these executive actions and orders go even beyond that, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=313.92s)]
*  and that's also true with the federal workforce [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=317.2s)]
*  and some of the things that he has done [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=319.92s)]
*  through various agencies to eliminate people [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=321.8s)]
*  who are serving in high-powered positions [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=325.2s)]
*  simply because he disagreed with their underlying politics. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=327.04s)]
*  Can you elaborate on that, Major? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=330.08000000000004s)]
*  Yes, so for example, the commandant of the Coast Guard today [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=331.52000000000004s)]
*  was relieved of her duties. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=335.08000000000004s)]
*  And it was said that she would become excessively oriented [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=337.24s)]
*  toward diversity, equity, and inclusion. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=341.04s)]
*  Well, the most important thing that she had done [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=343.12s)]
*  as commandant of the Coast Guard was to say [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=344.76s)]
*  there had been a cover-up under a previous leader [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=348.2s)]
*  about sexual abuse or sexual harassment within the Coast Guard [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  that was having a materially negative effect [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=354.6s)]
*  on recruitment at the Coast Guard. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=356.72s)]
*  Under her leadership, Coast Guard recruitment [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=358.8s)]
*  for the first time in years met their targets. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=361.16s)]
*  So someone who had created a better environment, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=364.32s)]
*  and as I understand it, I'm not an expert on this, Lindsey, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=366.88s)]
*  the Coast Guard has made up 30% of women, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=369.4s)]
*  and this question of harassment or sexual assault [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=371.52s)]
*  and the Coast Guard's leadership orientation [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=374.44s)]
*  to those accusations was an important consideration. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=377.32s)]
*  Those things were being addressed, and profitably so, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=380.4s)]
*  because recruitment had increased. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=383.47999999999996s)]
*  And for all that, this commandant of the Coast Guard [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=385.79999999999995s)]
*  was fired, essentially, by this incoming administration. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  That's one indication of the priorities, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=391.79999999999995s)]
*  what you consider important, and what you consider [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=394.0s)]
*  a means by which to judge someone's performance. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=396.84s)]
*  All of those things are more than what was suggested [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=399.32s)]
*  during the campaign. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=403.12s)]
*  Thank you for putting that in context for us. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=404.24s)]
*  I have to be quick with you on this, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=405.76s)]
*  but this is something we haven't discussed yet. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=406.96s)]
*  In one of his executive actions, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=408.59999999999997s)]
*  ending the weaponization of the federal government, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=409.96s)]
*  the Trump administration says definitively, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=412.28s)]
*  the Biden administration and allies [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=414.32s)]
*  engaged in the weaponization of prosecutorial power [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=415.76s)]
*  to upend the democratic process. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=419.44s)]
*  This action directs all government agencies [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=421.44s)]
*  to find evidence of that and report back to Trump. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=423.76s)]
*  Is this in keeping with his campaign line, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=426.2s)]
*  I am your retribution? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=427.8s)]
*  It certainly sounds like it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=430.23999999999995s)]
*  Now look, if there is examples, there are examples, rather, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=431.08s)]
*  of government entities looking at someone [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=434.76s)]
*  and making a decision, either in terms of regulatory matters [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  or distributing federal relief, or disallowing [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=441.23999999999995s)]
*  or prohibiting someone from obtaining something [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=444.67999999999995s)]
*  from the federal government they would otherwise receive, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=446.47999999999996s)]
*  but for politics, of course the American people want that [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=448.76s)]
*  to be brought to the attention of the president [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=451.76s)]
*  and dealt with, but if there aren't, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=453.55999999999995s)]
*  and you're just simply suggesting or alleging [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=455.4s)]
*  without any facts simply because you disagree [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=458.48s)]
*  with their politics, that would be weaponization [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=460.48s)]
*  just led by a different party and a different president. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=463.32s)]
*  Major Garrett, thank you. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=466.20000000000005s)]
*  Sure. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR3FuILhGAQ&t=467.56s)]
