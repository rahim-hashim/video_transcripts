# What we know about the measles death reported in Texas
**CBS News:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y)
*  All right, now we want to bring you the latest on the deadly measles outbreak in Texas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Officials said Wednesday an unvaccinated child died of the highly contagious respiratory [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=4.36s)]
*  infection. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=9.52s)]
*  The disease is entirely preventable thanks to a vaccine that's been around for more [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=10.52s)]
*  than 60 years. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=15.4s)]
*  But this is the first measles death in the U.S. in nearly 10 years. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=16.88s)]
*  Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. downplayed the outbreak yesterday. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=21.2s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=26.32s)]
*  We're watching it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=27.96s)]
*  We put out a post on it yesterday and we're going to continue to follow it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=28.96s)]
*  Incidentally, there have been four measles outbreaks this year in this country, last [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=33.84s)]
*  year there were 16. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=39.64s)]
*  So it's not unusual. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=42.0s)]
*  We have measles outbreaks every year. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  Secretary saying it's not unusual. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=46.92s)]
*  Omar Villafranca now joins us from Lubbock, Texas, where you've been covering the fear [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=47.92s)]
*  among parents and how heartbreaking this news is. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=52.92s)]
*  What do we know about the child who died because of this outbreak? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=55.68s)]
*  Well, not so much, Errol, because there are patient privacy laws. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=60.68s)]
*  But what they can't tell us is that we mentioned as a child, the child was unvaccinated and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=65.08s)]
*  the child was school age. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=69.08s)]
*  Now, the state of Texas breaks down cases by age. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=70.48s)]
*  There's zero to four years old and four to 17. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=75.0s)]
*  So we know it was a child and we know that child was 17 and under. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=78.08s)]
*  When it comes to exact, where did they live? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=81.96s)]
*  Were they a member of that Mennonite community in Gaines County? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=86.72s)]
*  They just cannot legally give out that information. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=89.52s)]
*  We'd have to get it from the family and they're not speaking out. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  Now, thankfully, though, when it comes to news viewers can use, you spoke with the chief [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  medical officer at the hospital where the child was treated and you specifically pressed [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  her on how young these kids are and they can't get vaccinated yet. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=105.36s)]
*  What did she tell you about the overall response to this outbreak? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=109.04s)]
*  Well, the hospital is really responsible for a large coverage area. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=113.8s)]
*  I mean, we're in West Texas, we're in Lubbock, an hour and a half away is where this outbreak [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=118.0s)]
*  started. They cover, excuse me, roughly 300 mile radius. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=122.12s)]
*  So people are used to driving an hour or an hour and a half or two to come to this hospital [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=127.84s)]
*  because of the treatment and the care and the level of care that they can get. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=133.32s)]
*  So they're seeing a wide swath of people coming in. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=136.92s)]
*  And we played HHS Secretary Robert F. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  Kennedy Jr. Sat there. I asked her about, you know, he's saying that people are [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  quarantined, that's why they are hospitalized. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  And she says, no, no, no, that is not correct. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=148.64s)]
*  The people who are hospitalized here are all unvaccinated and they are getting [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=151.48s)]
*  respiratory treatment, extra oxygen, helping them breathe. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=156.6s)]
*  They're not here to quarantine. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=160.64s)]
*  Quarantine is something that people do at home. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=162.0s)]
*  And she wanted to make that clear since it seemed that the HHS Secretary was sort of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=163.88s)]
*  downplaying the hospitalizations here. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=169.32s)]
*  But keep in mind, they're doing a lot to try to educate people about measles. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=172.0s)]
*  And this is what she had to say about the measles virus and their reaction. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=176.88s)]
*  Measles is one of the most contagious viruses that we know of. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=181.76s)]
*  So if you think about 90 percent of susceptible patients will contract the measles if [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=186.12s)]
*  they're exposed. We only admit patients who are in the hospital. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=191.48s)]
*  We only admit patients who need to stay in the hospital because they need acute [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=193.76s)]
*  treatment that we can only provide in the hospital. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  We only want to admit those patients in the hospital who really need to be there. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=199.92s)]
*  And, Errol, this is also affecting how they're caring for patients. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=205.0s)]
*  So in their emergency room where people may walk in, they've set out almost like a [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=208.84s)]
*  screening hub outside because they don't want somebody with the measles to walk into [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=213.88s)]
*  the ventilation area and possibly spread it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=219.16s)]
*  So they're screening people outside. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=221.6s)]
*  And if they're coming in for measles, of course, they want to do the proper thing, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=223.96s)]
*  not only for the people inside getting care, but for the doctors and nurses as well [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=227.24s)]
*  to make sure they're not exposed. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So highly contagious. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=233.08s)]
*  Omar Villafranca in Lubbock, Texas for us this morning. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=235.76s)]
*  We appreciate your reporting. Thanks, Omar. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwMh6ANdM6Y&t=238.12s)]
