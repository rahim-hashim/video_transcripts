# Former USAID chief blasts Trump and Musk's gutting of agency
**CBS News:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs)
*  All staff for the U.S. Agency for International Development, also known as USAID, will be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=0.0s)]
*  placed on leave just two days from today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=5.04s)]
*  The former head of the agency joins us now. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=7.7s)]
*  Andrew Natsios served as the USAID administrator in the George W. Bush administration from [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=9.9s)]
*  2001 to 2006. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=15.34s)]
*  Andrew, thanks for being here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=16.94s)]
*  You have publicly criticized this decision. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=18.32s)]
*  Tell us about your concerns. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=21.52s)]
*  Well, number one, one of our most powerful weapons, humanitarian weapons, in this period [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=23.860000000000003s)]
*  of great power competition is our foreign aid program. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=31.020000000000003s)]
*  AID is one of the most respected aid institutions in the world. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=34.300000000000004s)]
*  It's one of the most accountable. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=38.06s)]
*  It was voted by a nonpartisan group that looks at the management of federal agencies from [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  a purely technical standpoint. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=46.5s)]
*  It ranked the third highest in the federal government. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=48.3s)]
*  So these attacks on aid by Musk and his young men who are assisting him are complete nonsense. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=51.26s)]
*  What they've done is to try to go through all the audits, find something somewhere that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=62.54s)]
*  they can criticize. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=66.5s)]
*  AID works in fragile states in the middle of civil wars where people are dying, people [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=67.5s)]
*  are starving to death, there are people in criminal organizations going after us. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=74.82s)]
*  Some of the programs don't work under those circumstances. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=80.14s)]
*  But the question is, do most of the programs work? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=83.25999999999999s)]
*  And which ones are the most effective? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=87.41999999999999s)]
*  First, we have an extensive program of health projects all over the world in the global [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=89.38s)]
*  South that give us advance warning of outbreaks of disease, diseases that can come to the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=99.25999999999999s)]
*  United States. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=105.46s)]
*  There's an outbreak of Ebola right now in Uganda. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=106.46s)]
*  There's a large AID mission with a lot of health officers there. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=109.18s)]
*  It's the best line of defense we have to protect ourselves. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=112.9s)]
*  There's a global supply chain for medical pharmaceuticals and for vaccines. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=118.1s)]
*  There's a vaccine now against Ebola. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=124.3s)]
*  And AID will be at the forefront if it existed. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=127.18s)]
*  It doesn't exist anymore. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=132.14s)]
*  They've sent all of the—they're about to send all of the staff home, shut all emissions [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=133.74s)]
*  down in 80 countries. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=138.14s)]
*  Two-thirds of the AID staff are not in Washington. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=139.73999999999998s)]
*  They're out in the field. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=142.38s)]
*  And most of them are people from the local country, by the way, who don't work for very [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=143.45999999999998s)]
*  high salaries, but who have advanced degrees, who are highly competent, worked for AID for [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=147.45999999999998s)]
*  years, know the country, know the language. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=151.61999999999998s)]
*  And they're wonderful examples of American humanitarianism, but most importantly, to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=154.61999999999998s)]
*  protect our interests and the interests of our friends. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=162.17999999999998s)]
*  We also are one of the leading agencies in the world to deal with agriculture and food [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=165.02s)]
*  security. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=171.54s)]
*  One of the things we know, the Arab Spring that took place, supposedly the Arab Spring, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=172.54s)]
*  was actually driven by food price increases. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=177.38s)]
*  And the Green Revolution in Asia was—a third of the AID budget was expended to carry out [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=180.38s)]
*  this Green Revolution that used improved seed varieties and had tripled food production. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=187.14s)]
*  This is during the Cold War, the late 60s, early 70s. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=194.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, President Obama, and I strongly support it, as did President Bush, proposed the same [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=197.58s)]
*  thing be done in Africa now. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=204.7s)]
*  And there's a big program to increase agricultural production in Africa. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=206.1s)]
*  These programs are in our interest and their interest. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=210.38s)]
*  You've just outlined many, many examples of how you believe this agency does good work [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=214.26s)]
*  across the globe. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=220.66s)]
*  I want to pull up a tweet, an ex-post from Elon Musk, if we can show that on the screen. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=221.7s)]
*  It says, USAID is a criminal organization. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=227.62s)]
*  Time for it to die. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=232.3s)]
*  So we just listened to you outline all of these positives about USAID. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=233.82s)]
*  Then you have the richest man in the world saying it's a criminal organization. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=238.57999999999998s)]
*  Time for it to die. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=242.01999999999998s)]
*  Before reacting just to this statement, help us understand why is there such antagonism [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=243.5s)]
*  towards USAID, beyond Musk on the right? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=251.1s)]
*  And what's your reaction to how to deal with that? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=255.74s)]
*  Where does it come from? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=258.62s)]
*  And beyond just listing the positives, how does USAID and its supportive community actually [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=260.3s)]
*  deal with this razor sharp criticism from one of the most powerful people in the world? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  Monk has a company named Skylink, and AID was investigating it for, apparently they [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=270.94s)]
*  were doing an audit of it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=283.98s)]
*  He was very angry about it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=285.3s)]
*  This precedes all this, this long before Trump was elected president. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=286.74s)]
*  And I think some of the animus comes from that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=292.54s)]
*  He does not like being investigated. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=295.34s)]
*  Number two, the administration needs to cut the budget. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=297.9s)]
*  They won't touch the entitlement programs, which are what's causing the budget deficits [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=302.26s)]
*  that are out of control, that are damaging the economy and the country. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=306.5s)]
*  This debt that we have, in my view, is the number one crisis facing the country. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=310.34s)]
*  But he won't cut the entitlement programs because it affects his base. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=316.74s)]
*  It's easy to cut foreign aid because the people who get the benefit of it directly are people [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=320.65999999999997s)]
*  in the global south who don't vote. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=326.1s)]
*  That's why they did it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=328.46s)]
*  And they've also grossly exaggerated how much money. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=330.1s)]
*  They say it's $80 billion. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=332.74s)]
*  It's not $80 billion. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=333.74s)]
*  It's $38 billion. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=335.54s)]
*  Let's get the statistics right. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=336.9s)]
*  And a large portion of that, 55% of that, is humanitarian assistance in famines and [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=339.14s)]
*  civil wars and emergencies like earthquakes. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=344.18s)]
*  And the rest, the other part of that is health programs, immunizing children against disease, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=347.7s)]
*  dealing with HIV AIDS that we've saved 25 million people's lives through President Bush's [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=354.58000000000004s)]
*  PEPFAR program. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=359.46000000000004s)]
*  Are you telling me we should let all those people die? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=360.46000000000004s)]
*  Because if they don't have antiretrovirals, they will die of AIDS. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=363.78000000000003s)]
*  These are people who are already infected. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=368.5s)]
*  So I have to say, I think this is a lot of garbage. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=370.70000000000005s)]
*  The notion that it's a criminal organization is a bold-faced lie. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=376.1s)]
*  And I ran the agency for five years. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=380.78000000000003s)]
*  I've ran seven institutions over the last 45 years. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=383.18s)]
*  AID officers are the best managers and some of the most honorable people I've met. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=386.65999999999997s)]
*  We lost 650 people in Afghanistan and Iraq who were murdered by the Taliban or by the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=391.82s)]
*  militias in Iraq. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=399.34s)]
*  They are our heroes. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=401.06s)]
*  Attacking them and calling them criminals is absolutely outrageous. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=402.82s)]
*  They should be treated the same way our troops are. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=406.53999999999996s)]
*  I'm a retired lieutenant colonel in the reserves. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=408.62s)]
*  I served in the first Gulf War and I see hate work in the same category as officers and [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=410.90000000000003s)]
*  enlisted people in the military. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=416.54s)]
*  Andrew, we appreciate you coming on to share that perspective and thank you for your time. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=418.7s)]
*  We'll have you back soon. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=422.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjFUSGGRs&t=423.74s)]
