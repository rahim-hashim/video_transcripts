# Can Trump broker peace between Russia's Putin and Ukraine without Zelenskyy?
**CBS News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08)
*  All right, so let's talk about another headline that likely you were wanting to know about. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=0.0s)]
*  Video to our monitors takes us to Saudi Arabia, where U.S. and Russian delegations came together. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=4.74s)]
*  There they are at a very important and history-making table. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=10.3s)]
*  They are talking about trying to end the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=12.84s)]
*  Present at that meeting, you see him right there, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, alongside [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=16.38s)]
*  National Security Advisor Mike Walz, and Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=20.44s)]
*  So what happened in the meeting? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=25.98s)]
*  So here's Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlining the four main goals for Russia and Ukraine [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=27.68s)]
*  that came out of the meeting. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=32.08s)]
*  Please. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=33.08s)]
*  Well, I would start by saying we've agreed on four principles that I think are important. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=34.08s)]
*  The first is that we are going to work, we're going to appoint our teams, respectively, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=37.92s)]
*  that have worked very quickly to reestablish the functionality of our respective missions [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=41.8s)]
*  in Washington and in Moscow. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=47.019999999999996s)]
*  For us to be able to continue to move down this road, we need to have diplomatic facilities [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=49.08s)]
*  that are operating and functioning normally. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=52.84s)]
*  The second point is that we're going to appoint a high-level team from our end to help negotiate [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=55.94s)]
*  and work through the end of the conflict in Ukraine in a way that's enduring and acceptable [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=60.58s)]
*  to all the parties engaged. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=65.24s)]
*  The third point is to begin to work at a high level as well, to begin to discuss and think [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=67.58s)]
*  about and examine both the geopolitical and economic cooperation that could result from [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=74.06s)]
*  an end to the conflict in Ukraine. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=80.32s)]
*  Obviously, we'd have to see that conflict come to a successful and enduring end in order [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=82.42s)]
*  for that to be possible. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=87.26s)]
*  And the last thing we agreed to is that while our teams are going to be working on all of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=88.94s)]
*  this, the four of us who are here today, the five of us that were here today, are going [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=92.98s)]
*  to remain engaged in this process to make sure that it's moving along in a productive way. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=98.4s)]
*  So the big question today is how do you broker peace between warring parties if both parties [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=104.06s)]
*  aren't in the room? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=108.3s)]
*  You've probably heard a lot about this and will by the time you sit down for dinner, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=109.38s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, not invited to that meeting, he now says his trip [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=112.34s)]
*  to Saudi Arabia is delayed. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=117.38s)]
*  He wants to avoid being linked to those conversations that we just told you about. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=118.88s)]
*  He already made a stance earlier this week saying he will not accept any outcomes from [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=122.92s)]
*  those negotiations if Ukraine, his country, is not involved. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=126.7s)]
*  Major points of contention for Mr. Zelensky, NATO membership, and regaining annexed territories. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=131.34s)]
*  National Security Advisor Mike Walz asked about that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=138.62s)]
*  This needs to be a permanent end to the war and not a temporary end as we've seen in the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=142.74s)]
*  past. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=149.86s)]
*  We know just the practical reality is that there is going to be some discussion of territory [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=151.10000000000002s)]
*  and there's going to be discussion of security guarantees. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=158.74s)]
*  Those are just fundamental basics that will undergird and underlie any type of discussion. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=162.76s)]
*  The facts will continue to push back on this notion that our allies haven't been consulted. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=171.12s)]
*  They are being consulted literally almost on a daily basis and will continue to do so. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=178.64s)]
*  So let's deepen that conversation. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=184.38s)]
*  CBS News White House reporter Olivia Rinaldi joins us now for more on this. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=185.72s)]
*  So does the Trump administration view this meeting as a success even though they're [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=189.16s)]
*  getting quite a bit of blowback for Zelensky not being invited to this part? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=193.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's good to be with you, Reid. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=198.92s)]
*  Largely they're viewing this as a success, I should say. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=200.44s)]
*  This is the first step in what is likely to be a very long process of Ukrainian peace [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=204.44s)]
*  talks between the U.S., Russia, and Ukraine. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=208.96s)]
*  But what this really did was something we haven't seen done in years, which is reopen [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=212.24s)]
*  conversations, high-level conversations between the two countries of the U.S. and Russia. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=216.32s)]
*  As you know, Russia became essentially a pariah when they invaded Ukraine just three years [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=221.44s)]
*  ago. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=226.04s)]
*  Sanctions economically, travel for high-level officials within their country. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=229.88s)]
*  This is the first time that the U.S. and Russia are really sitting down and having that conversation. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  You heard Secretary Rubio there talk about what are the goals of the relationships between [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=239.12s)]
*  these two countries going forward. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  I think they've been laid out three major things. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=246.68s)]
*  Restore staffing at their respective embassies in Washington and in Moscow. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=247.68s)]
*  That's huge. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=252.32s)]
*  Also creating a high-level team to support Ukrainian peace talks, these ongoing conversations [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=253.6s)]
*  that will be happening between these three countries. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=258.48s)]
*  And then third, exploring closer relations and economic cooperation. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=261.08s)]
*  That caught my eye. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=265.88s)]
*  That means a lot of those sanctions that we've seen on oligarchs, on Russian fuel, on certain [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=267.2s)]
*  elements of their economy and our economy as well, will be reopened up for conversations [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=273.7s)]
*  with Russia and use. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=278.22s)]
*  That is major and that's key. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=280.14s)]
*  That kind of shows where the U.S. is at in these negotiations, even if Ukraine wasn't [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=282.66s)]
*  at the table today. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=286.24s)]
*  The old saying, money talks, sounds like it is talking. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=287.74s)]
*  Rubio and Walz also spent much of that news conference praising Donald Trump. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=290.78000000000003s)]
*  In fact, the Secretary of State really emphasized the president's goal to end the war and emphasized [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=294.46s)]
*  the idea that really his administration brought Russia to the negotiation table. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=299.38s)]
*  They want to plant a flag in that for all of us to hear and here's what was said. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=304.62s)]
*  He wants it to end in a way that's fair. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=309.5s)]
*  He wants it to end in a way that's sustainable and enduring, not that leads to another conflict [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=311.34000000000003s)]
*  in two to three years. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=315.5s)]
*  That's not going to be easy to achieve, but he's the only one in the world that can begin [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=317.1s)]
*  that process. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=320.06s)]
*  Donald Trump is the only leader in the world that could initiate that process and today [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=321.06s)]
*  was the first step in that process. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=325.24s)]
*  All right, so process initiated, but what happens with the process? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=328.98s)]
*  We already said that Zelensky will not accept anything that comes out of that meeting. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=332.74s)]
*  He wasn't invited, right? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=336.26s)]
*  So how does the president plan to move forward with negotiations like this if Mr. Zelensky [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=337.62s)]
*  is not at the table to advocate for the interests of his people? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=343.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, Zelensky did meet with Vice President Vance last week at the Munich Security Conference. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=347.82s)]
*  Secretary Rubio was at that meeting as well where things including territory but also [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=354.9s)]
*  a critical minerals deal was potentially discussed to strengthen relations between U.S. and Ukraine. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=359.7s)]
*  That essentially would give the U.S. access to these critical minerals like lithium that [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=365.67999999999995s)]
*  Ukraine has an abundance of and in exchange the U.S. would have a vested interest in the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=370.94s)]
*  security of Ukraine. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=376.06s)]
*  That's kind of the play there. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=377.53999999999996s)]
*  But these talks today were largely to reopen conversations between the U.S. and Russia [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=379.35999999999996s)]
*  heading into these negotiations on the table. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=384.3s)]
*  Essentially sources within the administration saying that they can't really have frank [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=387.18s)]
*  conversations with Russia if they're not talking with them. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=391.74s)]
*  So that was the first step in opening that door today to have those conversations with [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=394.34s)]
*  them and see exactly what is on the table and what is needed to get to lasting peace [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=397.94s)]
*  that they talked about in Ukraine. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=403.53999999999996s)]
*  But as you mentioned, Zelensky wasn't there and we know that he is planning, he was planning [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=405.18s)]
*  a trip to Saudi Arabia and he says he's not going to be attending now. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=410.02s)]
*  Sources citing that he says he's avoiding the visit because he doesn't want to be linked [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=413.78000000000003s)]
*  to these U.S. Russia talks that he is not entirely in agreement with. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=417.46000000000004s)]
*  You have three parties here who have different interests and getting them all on the same [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=422.22s)]
*  page in the same agreement is very different. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=426.42s)]
*  Ukraine wants to keep its sovereignty. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=429.54s)]
*  Russia wants to make sure that this three year long, very costly war that they launched [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=431.1s)]
*  actually has some benefit to them, whether or not they should or not. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=436.18s)]
*  And the U.S. of course wants to see brokered peace, but also perhaps, as we know with this [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=441.3s)]
*  critical minerals deal, maybe get something out of it for themselves as well. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=445.90000000000003s)]
*  So a lot of negotiating that needs to be done to make sure all these parties are on the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=450.1s)]
*  same page and that everyone walks away from this deal feeling good and that there can [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=455.02000000000004s)]
*  be lasting peace. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=461.54s)]
*  And it's not exactly something easy to achieve. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=462.62s)]
*  There was a deal back in 2014 and clearly that fell apart when Russia invaded Ukraine. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=465.14000000000004s)]
*  Territory, security and a lot of political muscle in the room, just not Mr. Zelensky [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=470.66s)]
*  of Ukraine. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=476.06s)]
*  Olivia Rinaldi, thank you so much. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiIFPPwVb08&t=476.66s)]
