# Senate unanimously confirms Marco Rubio as secretary of state
**CBS News:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4)
*  Let's go to Capitol Hill and Congressional correspondent Nicole Kelly and Nicole catch us up to speed on all of the confirmation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=0.0s)]
*  Happenings that have been going on [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=6.24s)]
*  Well as you noted at the top of the broadcast the big headline is that Marco Rubio has been confirmed as [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=8.56s)]
*  Secretary of State and not only confirmed but confirmed unanimously and in a bipartisan vote [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=15.88s)]
*  99 to 0 was the final tally [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=21.8s)]
*  He was also confirmed unanimously out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee prior to that full-floor vote [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=23.78s)]
*  In fact Rubio gaggled with reporters not too long ago and said that it is a great honor [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=29.540000000000003s)]
*  He said that he feels hopefully people voted for him because they think that he would do a good job [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=36.74s)]
*  He also opined a little bit about you know, leaving the Senate [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=43.02s)]
*  Obviously as he makes this transition to be the top diplomat saying that he will miss the relationships here [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=47.46s)]
*  He was asked about some of the current global crises that are occurring [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=54.06s)]
*  Including this new ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=59.42s)]
*  He said that it presents a pretty unique situation and talked a little bit about [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=63.0s)]
*  Hoping that both sides continue to comply by the agreement so that it can be carried out in full [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=68.10000000000001s)]
*  He also was asked about the timetable for ending the war in Ukraine [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=74.38s)]
*  Of course President Trump has made that a priority and has said at times that he would end it [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=79.10000000000001s)]
*  You know on day one, but obviously that war between Russia and Ukraine continues [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=84.78s)]
*  Rubio saying that he is not going to put any kind of timetable on when the conflict may end but [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=90.58s)]
*  Reiterating that it certainly remains a top goal of the new president [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=97.22s)]
*  And in addition to that, of course, there were a couple of other key [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=101.9s)]
*  Nominees who were voted out of committee this evening that includes a John Ratcliffe who is president Trump's [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=106.66000000000001s)]
*  Pick for CIA director. We thought we could get a full confirmation vote on his nomination tonight [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=113.62s)]
*  But instead it was just voted out of committee [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=120.54s)]
*  But is expected to advance on the Senate floor pretty swiftly at some point this week [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=123.62s)]
*  Also, another notable name is Pete Hegseth [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=128.82s)]
*  Of course the president's pick for defense secretary as you know because we've been covering for some time his [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=131.9s)]
*  nomination especially has been more controversial given some of the allegations that he has faced around sexual assault which he has denied financial [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=138.66000000000003s)]
*  mismanagement from this time leading to a [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=146.82000000000002s)]
*  Nonprofit veterans organizations, of course during his confirmation hearing just last week some of those issues came up. But again the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=149.22000000000003s)]
*  Defense secretary nominee kind of defended his conduct and again denied any wrongdoing [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=156.82s)]
*  So at this point in terms of that vote out of the Senate Armed Services Committee tonight [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=161.98s)]
*  It was strictly on party lines, which is important to note the chair of that committee Roger wicker telling [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=166.34s)]
*  Reporters this evening that he is hopeful that his confirmation a vote can advance on the Senate floor later this week [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=173.26s)]
*  potentially maybe towards the end of this week, but [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=180.38s)]
*  Obviously that is one where they will have to do a whip count and make sure they have the votes before proceeding [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=183.78s)]
*  I would note Susan Collins who is considered a swing vote, you know from Maine [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=189.78s)]
*  She has indicated that she has not made a decision yet about whether or not she will support his confirmation. So ultimately [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=194.46s)]
*  You know, she is certainly one to watch and we will have to see how that vote count advances as we get into this week [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=202.46s)]
*  Nicole Kellyanne, appreciate you [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6o0aApdd4&t=209.18s)]
