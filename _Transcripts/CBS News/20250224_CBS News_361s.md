# Federal employees suing Elon Musk over tasks email
**CBS News:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg)
*  Well, federal employees suing Elon Musk over this email. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=0.0s)]
*  You see it right here behind me sent to millions. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=3.52s)]
*  It happened Saturday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=5.96s)]
*  Here's what it asks. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  What did you do last week? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=8.8s)]
*  The email demands employees list five things [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=10.44s)]
*  that they accomplished. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  The directive previewed in a post by Elon Musk on X [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=13.92s)]
*  threatens, quote, failure to respond [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=18.0s)]
*  will be taken as a resignation, close quote. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=20.0s)]
*  And by the way, there's a deadline, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=23.14s)]
*  a ticking clock here, midnight tonight. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=24.18s)]
*  So here's the fallout. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  Five agencies encouraging employees not to respond. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=28.6s)]
*  The Department of Defense, the FBI, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  and the Department of National Intelligence among them. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=33.36s)]
*  Those are some heavy hitter organizations [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  there on your screen. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=38.24s)]
*  So let's go live to CBS News White House reporter [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=39.36s)]
*  Olivia Rinaldi. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=41.44s)]
*  All right, so Olivia, this is so confusing at this hour [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=42.260000000000005s)]
*  because bosses are saying to ignore. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=44.84s)]
*  Lawyers are lowering. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=47.92s)]
*  How is this playing out today in DC? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  Hey Reed, it's good to be with you. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=53.68000000000001s)]
*  The six words that really sent shock waves [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=54.82s)]
*  across the federal government. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=56.84s)]
*  What did you do last week? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=57.92s)]
*  Elon Musk now asking people to reply to this email. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  Five bullet points of something they did last week, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=64.28s)]
*  what they accomplished. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=66.6s)]
*  And if they don't reply by 5 p.m. today, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=67.8s)]
*  that's considered their resignation. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=70.56s)]
*  We're starting to see though some pushback [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=72.36s)]
*  from secretaries across the government. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=74.2s)]
*  You named a few there. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=76.36s)]
*  Let me walk you through a little bit more detail there. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=77.2s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, the director of National Intelligence, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=79.44s)]
*  told her employees not to respond [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=81.84s)]
*  because some of the work they do, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  most of the work they do, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=84.56s)]
*  is critical and highly classified. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=86.06s)]
*  Probably not something you should be responding to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=88.7s)]
*  on an email thread about. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=91.06s)]
*  The undersecretary of defense for personnel readiness [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=93.02s)]
*  at the Pentagon told employees, quote, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=95.22s)]
*  when and if required, the department will coordinate [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=97.9s)]
*  responses to the email you've received from OPM. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=100.02000000000001s)]
*  But for now, please pause any response to the OPM email [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=103.26s)]
*  titled what did you do last week? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=106.78s)]
*  So now this is some of the pushback we're seeing [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=109.28s)]
*  from federal agencies, secretaries, undersecretaries [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=111.46000000000001s)]
*  across the government against Elon Musk and Doge, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=114.22s)]
*  but it's also raising a lot of questions, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=117.06s)]
*  namely among them, security. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=118.98s)]
*  If you have 2.3 million federal employees [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=121.26s)]
*  writing back on an email chain about what they did last week, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=124.7s)]
*  it can almost amount to a national security issue [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=128.06s)]
*  laying out what all federal employees [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=131.06s)]
*  across the government are doing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=134.06s)]
*  So important to note there, but also questions of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=135.7s)]
*  who will be coming through these emails [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=137.7s)]
*  to see what they accomplished last week? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=140.24s)]
*  What is the threshold for adequate work [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=142.26s)]
*  when responding to this email? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=145.29999999999998s)]
*  What if someone replied and didn't list out what they did? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=147.62s)]
*  It wasn't five things that they listed out. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=150.54s)]
*  A lot of questions about what this actually means, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=153.01999999999998s)]
*  especially for a federal workforce of the scale I mentioned, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=155.94s)]
*  2.3 million people. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=159.89999999999998s)]
*  This isn't a private company, this is the government. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=160.98s)]
*  So it'll be interesting to see what's actually the fallout [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=163.85999999999999s)]
*  and the impact from not answering this email [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=166.29999999999998s)]
*  or answering it incorrectly. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=169.89999999999998s)]
*  And a reminder, we're talking about a non-elected official [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=171.54s)]
*  on his own platform that generates income [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=174.74s)]
*  telling federal workers, government employees, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=177.66s)]
*  that this will be seen as a resignation [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=180.82s)]
*  if they don't respond. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=182.42s)]
*  But I have to ask, despite the pushback, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=183.74s)]
*  we are seeing some fall in line. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=185.62s)]
*  Let's take, for example, Sean Duffy. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=187.18s)]
*  Of course, we know he's the Transportation Secretary. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=189.3s)]
*  He posted on that very social media platform his answer. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=191.66s)]
*  What did he say? What did you see? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=195.12s)]
*  Yeah, there's one Cabinet Secretary that is complying. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=197.82s)]
*  It is Sean Duffy with the Department of Transportation. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=200.14s)]
*  Let's walk through what he said on that post, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=202.7s)]
*  the five things he says he did last week. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=205.18s)]
*  Number one, quoting here, paraphrasing, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=207.57999999999998s)]
*  he said he terminated congestion pricing in New York. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=210.85999999999999s)]
*  Two, he launched an investigation [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=214.29999999999998s)]
*  into California's high-speed rail project [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=216.14s)]
*  that cost several billion dollars over a number of years. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=217.98s)]
*  Three, he said he saved 10 million a year [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=221.1s)]
*  by eliminating quote, redundant and outdated rail lines. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=222.94s)]
*  He also visited the Air Traffic Control Command Center [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=226.14000000000001s)]
*  in Virginia to talk about the critical tech upgrades there [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=228.46s)]
*  and why we would need to make our air traffic control system [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=231.74s)]
*  the envy of the world. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=235.54000000000002s)]
*  And five, he said he went out to Burbank, California [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=236.86s)]
*  to tour a control tower out there [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=239.54000000000002s)]
*  and hear from those controllers [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=242.18s)]
*  about how to improve conditions [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=243.38s)]
*  and retain and recruit controllers. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=245.18s)]
*  I should note, though, that this email was also received [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=247.82000000000002s)]
*  by air traffic controllers who voiced concern [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=251.3s)]
*  and confusion about what exactly this meant for them, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=254.22s)]
*  the union telling their people to pause on replying [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=257.62s)]
*  until they got more clarity [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=261.82s)]
*  from the Department of Transportation [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=263.42s)]
*  about what exactly this meant. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=264.94s)]
*  This is also a workforce that works usually [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=266.94s)]
*  about six days a week on antiquated technology [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=269.38s)]
*  and is often very focused on landing planes [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=272.46000000000004s)]
*  and the safety around that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=276.3s)]
*  Now we are hearing from the Department of Transportation [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=277.98s)]
*  that they are requiring the Department of Transportation [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=280.62s)]
*  are required to answer this email [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=283.7s)]
*  and justify what they accomplished last week [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=286.3s)]
*  being airline safety professionals. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=289.78s)]
*  So this now loops in folks like them [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=291.74s)]
*  who are doing critical, critical work [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=295.74s)]
*  who are now having to explain on this email [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=297.94s)]
*  exactly what they do. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=300.58s)]
*  And it's only Monday. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=302.38s)]
*  Gotta ask you about this, Elon Musk. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=303.7s)]
*  He also had another warning for federal employees [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=305.21999999999997s)]
*  about returning to office. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=308.7s)]
*  What was that warning? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=309.86s)]
*  Yes, this was another post on X that came out. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=313.7s)]
*  Elon Musk said that government workers [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=316.97999999999996s)]
*  will be placed on administrative leave [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=319.38s)]
*  if they don't return to work this week. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=321.62s)]
*  This is of course an executive order [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=323.74s)]
*  that Trump had signed among his first days in office. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=325.21999999999997s)]
*  Musk says that they were given a month warning [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=328.65999999999997s)]
*  and if they don't come back, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=331.26s)]
*  they are placed on administrative leave. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=332.38s)]
*  We know that a lot of workers [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=334.98s)]
*  have been coming back into the office. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=336.34s)]
*  It's been quite congested here in DC with some traffic [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=337.74s)]
*  and the metro lines being more full than years previously. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=342.02s)]
*  But interesting to note that this is coming from Elon Musk, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=346.54s)]
*  not from the White House directly, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=349.74s)]
*  but from what is a senior advisor [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=351.22s)]
*  and special government employee making these mandates. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=352.90000000000003s)]
*  All right, lots to keep track of. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=356.46000000000004s)]
*  Olivia and Bernalde, thank you so much. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=358.14s)]
*  Always good to talk to you. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qlV5rW_Xg&t=359.78000000000003s)]
