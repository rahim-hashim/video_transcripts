*  Some of them live here others just visiting. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V1A7y4-Mlc&t=100.42s)]
*  They were headed to Minneapolis, Minnesota [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V1A7y4-Mlc&t=102.9s)]
*  still waiting to try to figure out exactly [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V1A7y4-Mlc&t=105.38s)]
*  what went wrong. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V1A7y4-Mlc&t=107.18s)]
*  The company says as you pointed out that [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V1A7y4-Mlc&t=108.14s)]
*  there was an engine issue they're investigating [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V1A7y4-Mlc&t=109.94s)]
*  the FAA as well but also you got to remember [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V1A7y4-Mlc&t=112.78s)]
*  this is happening in the middle of a severe winter [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V1A7y4-Mlc&t=116.3s)]
*  storm here in the Atlanta area in the south altogether [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V1A7y4-Mlc&t=118.5s)]
*  and so there was a big hang up a big pause if you will [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V1A7y4-Mlc&t=122.41999999999999s)]
*  here throughout this morning at the world's [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V1A7y4-Mlc&t=126.33999999999999s)]
*  busiest airport as of now though things appear [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V1A7y4-Mlc&t=128.54s)]
*  to be slowly getting back out there in terms [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V1A7y4-Mlc&t=132.57999999999998s)]
*  of flights taking off. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V1A7y4-Mlc&t=135.42s)]
*  All right Skyler Henry reporting live we're glad [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V1A7y4-Mlc&t=136.7s)]
*  that this wasn't worse but always very scary [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V1A7y4-Mlc&t=139.45999999999998s)]
*  when you hear air traffic control and pilots [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V1A7y4-Mlc&t=142.1s)]
*  saying fire coming out of an engine we're glad [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V1A7y4-Mlc&t=143.7s)]
*  they got on top of it quickly thank you so much. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V1A7y4-Mlc&t=145.62s)]
