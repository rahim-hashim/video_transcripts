# World reacts to U.S. participating in talks with Russia on Ukraine war
**CBS News:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo)
*  Senior U.S. and Russian officials are meeting in Saudi Arabia tomorrow for talks on how [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=0.0s)]
*  to end the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=4.32s)]
*  U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrived in Riyadh this morning. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=6.4s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not involved in the talks, despite saying [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=9.88s)]
*  he won't accept any decisions about Ukraine without his country's participation. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=14.48s)]
*  European leaders gathered in Paris today for an emergency meeting to discuss the planned [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=19.64s)]
*  negotiations. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=23.48s)]
*  Joining me now in Studio 57 is CBS News Middle East reporter Courtney Keighley. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=24.48s)]
*  Courtney, what do we know about this emergency meeting in Paris today? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=28.72s)]
*  Well, they're really reacting to Marco Rubio being in Riyadh and not just meeting with [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=31.36s)]
*  the Crown Prince there, but also meeting with the Russian officials and Sergey Lavrov. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  So their reaction was from the Munich Security Conference that we saw top U.S. officials [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=39.6s)]
*  and top international officials. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=43.84s)]
*  They called a meeting in Paris and said, we better start talking about Ukraine peace as [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=45.82s)]
*  well. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=50.8s)]
*  So what they're doing is the UK, for instance, there, it's hosted by Emmanuel Macron. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=51.8s)]
*  The UK is saying maybe we'll have boots on the ground for peacekeeping. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=56.36s)]
*  So say the Germans, so say the Swedes. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=59.28s)]
*  Poland is saying maybe we can do some stability and strengthening of the border and the other [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=61.96s)]
*  border right with Ukraine. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=67.2s)]
*  Belarus is not in the mix, but Belarus does count. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=68.48s)]
*  So this is Europe saying, if we're not at the table, we need to get a table set up for [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=71.56s)]
*  our own security and we got to get ahead of this if the U.S. is going. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=76.92s)]
*  Is there any world in which a peace agreement does not involve a concession of land from [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=81.36s)]
*  Ukraine? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=86.92s)]
*  That's probably the biggest question. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=88.36s)]
*  And it's pretty much unseeable. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=90.48s)]
*  Ukraine has this piece of Russian land right now. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=93.8s)]
*  That's in place. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=96.4s)]
*  The first region, right? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=97.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=98.4s)]
*  And also the Russians need that port. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=99.4s)]
*  Russians need the port because they lost a port in Syria. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=101.12s)]
*  So it's a really geopolitical issue, too. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=103.6s)]
*  Russians are coming to the table. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=105.48s)]
*  They lost their leverage in some of the Middle East. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=106.56s)]
*  They still have to have leverage. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=109.44s)]
*  But the question is, when President Trump says these things out loud, is he giving it [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=110.92s)]
*  all away or is he setting up for better negotiations? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=114.76s)]
*  Mark Rubio is there to start laying the groundwork with Sergey Lavrov. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=117.64s)]
*  But Lavrov has been doing this for a long time and he is his own top negotiator and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  he can run circles around people. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=127.56s)]
*  So we'll have to see what he does, too. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=129.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=130.24s)]
*  You're up. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ywHJ-KXwo&t=131.24s)]
