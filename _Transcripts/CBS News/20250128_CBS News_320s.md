# Trump's memo pausing federal aid is causing panic, Schumer says
**CBS News:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4)
*  All right, looking live at the White House right off the top, you know, in the midst [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=0.0s)]
*  of executive orders restructuring the way the government governs and in the midst of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  an immigration crackdown, the nation will hear the first press briefing under the new [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=8.96s)]
*  Trump administration. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=13.08s)]
*  So watch for us to go there live in about an hour here on 24 seven. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  Now one headline we have our eyes on is this an internal memo sent by the White House, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=18.64s)]
*  putting a temporary pause on nearly all federal financial assistance programs. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=24.68s)]
*  We're also talking about federal grants and federal loans. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=29.44s)]
*  So what kind of impacts are we looking at there? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=31.8s)]
*  Everything from aid to nonprofits, money to universities, even small business loans. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=35.32s)]
*  Here's reaction on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  Every one of our offices has been deluged with calls from people who are in panic. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=44.0s)]
*  What is this going to mean? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=49.78s)]
*  What if I have a hospital that has people on life support? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  What are we going to do? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=58.0s)]
*  And just like the January 6 pardons, this decision is lawless, dangerous, destructive, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=60.4s)]
*  cruel. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=70.16s)]
*  It's illegal. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=71.16s)]
*  It's unconstitutional. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=73.32s)]
*  He said he's going to review it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=74.32s)]
*  He's not halting. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=76.12s)]
*  He's reviewing it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=77.12s)]
*  And in a certain amount of time, he's going to release it again. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=78.12s)]
*  That's what he ran on. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=81.16s)]
*  I think it violates the anti-empowerment act, which is what he got impeached for with respect [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=82.16s)]
*  to withholding congressionally appropriated money from Ukraine. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=87.84s)]
*  And you will notice that in the hearing with the budget director, Russ Vogt, last week, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=92.2s)]
*  the nominee, he wouldn't commit to following the law. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  So I think the administration feels like we don't have to follow the law and we're going [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=98.44s)]
*  to we will act illegally until the court tells us we have to stop. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=101.56s)]
*  As the legislative branch, are you worried you're losing some of your powers of the purse? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=105.04s)]
*  Nope. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=109.2s)]
*  I mean, I'm worried about a president behaving unlawfully. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=110.2s)]
*  I'm not worried about our action. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=112.64s)]
*  So we're talking about interpretations there and a smattering of them at that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News White House reporter Aaron Navarro. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=119.72s)]
*  Aaron, there's really a ticking clock for these agencies to report back. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=123.4s)]
*  Who is at risk really of losing these federal dollars? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=127.2s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=132.12s)]
*  Agencies have to decide and enforce this freeze by 5 p.m. today. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=133.12s)]
*  We do know who's not impacted. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=137.96s)]
*  And the memo says clearly that Medicare and Social Security benefits will not be impacted. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  It says that assistance provided directly to individuals will not be impacted. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=144.32s)]
*  But it's the organizations, groups that administer those funds that could be. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=148.84s)]
*  And it's important to note as our team has been reaching out to organizations, they have [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=153.4s)]
*  not been in touch yet with federal officials. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=156.72s)]
*  But it could be a sweeping impact here. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=159.48s)]
*  This freeze, nonprofits, food assistance programs, the first unfocused children organization [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=161.72s)]
*  says this freeze could impact $329 billion for programs such as food assistance, school [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=167.28s)]
*  meal programs. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=172.72s)]
*  Certainly a sweeping effect. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  But just to put in context kind of the reasoning behind this memo from OMB, from the White [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  House, they say that financial assistance should quote be dedicated to advancing administration [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  priorities, quote ending wokeness and resources that advance Marxist equity, transgenderism [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  and the Green New Deal. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=191.72s)]
*  So certainly following through on a Trump campaign promise, but it remains to be seen [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=193.36s)]
*  exactly how programs will be impacted, hoping to get clarification in a briefing you mentioned. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=198.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=203.96s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=204.96s)]
*  And so we know let's talk about that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=205.96s)]
*  You're going to be in that room for that first press briefing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=206.96s)]
*  What questions will really take the lead there as that briefing starts today? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=210.64s)]
*  Yeah, this will be the first White House press secretary briefing by Caroline Levitt, who [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=216.2s)]
*  had served in the Trump campaign. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=222.44s)]
*  Certainly a lot of questions in regards to the freeze, as well as the recent executive [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=225.28s)]
*  orders regarding transgender service members and other things related to the military that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=229.68s)]
*  President Trump signed just last night. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=234.76s)]
*  Also on the docket this week are continued immigration enforcement actions, as well as [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=237.34s)]
*  a smattering of the more maybe controversial nominees that President Trump has put out [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=242.84s)]
*  there in terms of congressional confirmation hearings such as Cash Patel, Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=248.12s)]
*  Questions about that potentially, but it's expected to be a lot, just given just how [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  much activity there's been in this Trump White House in the past week and some change. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=258.92s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  And this is also playing out and likely will drive some questions. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  I want to ask you about it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=266.88s)]
*  The Justice Department firing at least a dozen employees connected to the Trump investigation. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=267.88s)]
*  How is the administration framing and justifying these firings? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=272.96s)]
*  Yeah, these employees were notified by email that they were unable to carry out the president's [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=277.24s)]
*  agenda. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=283.44s)]
*  A Justice Department official said the decision was made because these officials could quote, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=284.44s)]
*  not be trusted to faithfully implement the president's agenda because of their role in [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=288.21999999999997s)]
*  prosecuting the president. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=293.14s)]
*  Now, Trump as a candidate promised to clean house in a sense in the Department of Justice [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=294.82s)]
*  last week. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=300.0s)]
*  He also signed an executive order that tried to curb the quote weaponization of the federal [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=301.0s)]
*  government. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=305.54s)]
*  That's a phrase he and allies often use to describe Jack Smith's case. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=306.54s)]
*  Aaron, we know you've got to leave that lawn and get into that first press briefing of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=310.97999999999996s)]
*  the Trump era, the second Trump era. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=314.82s)]
*  We appreciate you so much stepping out and taking some time with us today. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOJgl1Rytc4&t=316.73999999999995s)]
