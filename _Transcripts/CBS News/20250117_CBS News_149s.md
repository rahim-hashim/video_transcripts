# Extreme cold weather forecast for U.S.
**CBS News:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY)
*  Alright, take it live now to Minneapolis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=0.0s)]
*  You're used to the cold there. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=1.6400000000000001s)]
*  We know that, but get ready [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=3.08s)]
*  for it to get really intense. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=4.72s)]
*  The temperatures expected to drop even more. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  I want to bring in just now with [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=9.64s)]
*  more on this cold snap this region [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=11.8s)]
*  is getting my gosh is going to be [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=13.76s)]
*  brutal as we head into this weekend's forecast. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=15.68s)]
*  We're watching the storm develop [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=18.16s)]
*  throughout the next 24 hours, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=19.72s)]
*  sweeping across all the West or the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=20.84s)]
*  Eastern states. However, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=22.96s)]
*  it's not the storm that we're even concerned about. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=24.04s)]
*  It's the cold, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=27.36s)]
*  dense air on the back end of this strong system. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=28.16s)]
*  And as you take a look behind me, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=31.12s)]
*  we're going to show you it right now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=32.2s)]
*  It's this polar vortex that we're [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=33.84s)]
*  concerned about when it comes to [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=35.2s)]
*  temperatures about 20 to 30 degrees [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=36.72s)]
*  below freezing when it comes to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  that wind chill factor. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=40.04s)]
*  So here's what we're dealing with. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=40.92s)]
*  Heading into our Saturday forecast, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=42.44s)]
*  many of us now wrapping up school and work, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=43.64s)]
*  heading into what would be a pleasant weekend [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=45.84s)]
*  if we didn't have this monster of a storm. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=47.84s)]
*  It's going to be a chilly setup, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=50.04s)]
*  so what's important to note is maybe [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  gearing up now preparing now, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=53.44s)]
*  which is some extra food, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=54.64s)]
*  some heaters in the house and bundle up [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=55.92s)]
*  and take it slow because from New Mexico [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=58.24s)]
*  all the way up into areas like the Dakotas, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  we're going to be seeing temperatures [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=63.08s)]
*  well below average for this time of year, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=64.72s)]
*  and we're getting a fair share [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  of snow too along the Rockies. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=68.6s)]
*  I mean, we can see anywhere up to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=70.28s)]
*  around 8 inches in some of these [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=72.16s)]
*  areas like Pueblo all the way over into [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=74.0s)]
*  Denver. They're getting closer [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=76.0s)]
*  to 6 inches of snow. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=77.08s)]
*  Now here's our daytime highs today. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=78.48s)]
*  Compared to tomorrow, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  notice how we cool down significantly. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=81.12s)]
*  I mean, Bismarck in Minneapolis already [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=82.88s)]
*  had temperatures around 3 to 8 degrees. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=84.64s)]
*  We advanced the clock all the way into Sunday. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=86.72s)]
*  Now we're in the freezing temperatures. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=89.12s)]
*  I mean, negative 1 degrees near Bismarck, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=90.84s)]
*  a similar trend all the way over into [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=92.72s)]
*  Minnesota too and you know my floor [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=94.72s)]
*  director was very kind to list off the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=96.64s)]
*  football games. I'm not a football person, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=98.88s)]
*  but it's important to know Saturday. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=100.8s)]
*  The Texans are going to be playing the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=102.32s)]
*  Chiefs all the way over into Kansas City, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=104.12s)]
*  and we're talking about temperatures [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=106.08s)]
*  sitting close to around at 0 [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=107.44s)]
*  degrees for that wind chill. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=108.8s)]
*  We're also expecting more football [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=110.04s)]
*  games as we head all the way over [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  into Philadelphia and Buffalo. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=113.08s)]
*  Make a really good point by the way. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=114.24s)]
*  It is going to be a cold one, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=116.44s)]
*  not only for you know millions of [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=118.08s)]
*  Americans at home just trying to bundle up, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=119.72s)]
*  but for any of these sports games to happen, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=121.8s)]
*  this is going to impact that too. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=123.96s)]
*  You see the video of the sports fans [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  sitting in their seats and they're all [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  bundled up with a coat on top of a coat, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=129.68s)]
*  and all you see is their eyes. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=132.16s)]
*  You're going brutal. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=133.95999999999998s)]
*  You know that is dedication. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=134.72s)]
*  That is a true fan. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=136.0s)]
*  Those are not fair weather fans. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=137.32s)]
*  They are in it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=138.92s)]
*  Rain shine, extreme cold. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=140.24s)]
*  I know I know. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  I forget about that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=142.4s)]
*  I forget about that sometimes too, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=143.52s)]
*  so it is important to say yeah, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=144.84s)]
*  good luck. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENMVVu-TwCY&t=146.68s)]
