# New images show severe wildfire destruction in California
**CBS News:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8)
*  Welcome back to CBS News 24 7 looking live video coming into our many monitors of CBS News 24 7 telling the story of a California tragedy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome in. I'm Reed Cowan. So fires in California we now know have claimed at least five lives. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=9.84s)]
*  So here's where we are as this breaking news story plays out in real time. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=16.12s)]
*  More than 1300 homes and businesses just leveled destroyed. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=20.0s)]
*  There are five wildfires burning in all all around Los Angeles. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=24.88s)]
*  The two largest right there on your screen on the left the Eaton fire destroying a business there on the right. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=28.88s)]
*  The Palisades fire doing fast work of a home somebody's home. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=34.64s)]
*  It's gone. Palisades fire and the Eaton fire both at 0 percent containment at this hour. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=39.64s)]
*  So let's drill down the Eaton fire burning near Pasadena exploding to more than 10,000 acres. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=44.96s)]
*  The Palisades fire burning near Malibu consuming more than 17,000 acres. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=52.36s)]
*  We're talking about highly populated acres at that more than 130,000 people right now under evacuation orders or warnings. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=57.32s)]
*  You know we throw out numbers all the time but let's really try to get this in your head when we talk about that many people. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=67.32s)]
*  One hundred and thirty thousand people what it represents picture two massive football stadiums and put people in those seats. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=73.08s)]
*  That's roughly the number of people who are on the run right now. Listen. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=81.16s)]
*  Today it is absolutely imperative that as we move into day three of this firestorm all members of our Los Angeles community maintain vigilance. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=85.47999999999999s)]
*  A lot of them are taking place from people who did not choose to evacuate putting their own lives at risk. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=100.12s)]
*  So please if you're asked to evacuate evacuate because it's not only your life you're putting in danger. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=107.8s)]
*  So our CBS News teams on the fire lines reporting live for days including Chris Van Cleave. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=114.84s)]
*  He is in the city of Pasadena. You heard from that news conference saying some people chose not to leave putting their lives on the line. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=119.44s)]
*  It's almost unthinkable that somebody would stay back when you see the devastation behind you Chris. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  Well you got to understand Reed the the Eaton fire in particular if we pan over is burning all the way up on that ridgeline up in the Angeles National Forest. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=130.96s)]
*  The fire line the center of this giant 10,000 acre fire is nowhere near where I'm standing right now. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=140.0s)]
*  But the winds were so strong when this storm kicked up we're talking hurricane force winds. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=147.52s)]
*  We're talking hurricane force winds they were blowing burning embers one two even three miles away. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=155.36s)]
*  So we're a mile plus from that fire this neighborhood is gone is gone and this is one of the neighborhoods where someone died. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=163.12s)]
*  Stayed behind to try to protect their home with a garden hose and it cost the man his life. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=172.32s)]
*  So Chris you are also our transportation. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  The evacuation order Reed. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=181.52s)]
*  Yeah you're also our transportation correspondent there forgive me for jumping in during that delay there. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  But because of your expertise in transportation my friend for those people who want to evacuate and that is the lion's share of people getting out has been difficult as well. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=188.16000000000003s)]
*  Those thoroughfares jammed for days. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=197.84s)]
*  Well you got to understand particularly as you get into the foothills these are two lane roads they're often windy roads. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=200.88000000000002s)]
*  It is not easy to rapidly evacuate and when these fires were exploding the way that they did where in an hour they're 10 times the size they were. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=207.12s)]
*  It is very hard to quickly move out of places like the palisades are up here in the Pasadena foothills. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  So you know people needed to be ready were they ready to evacuate. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=225.67999999999998s)]
*  You know some people we know we talked to that that had loaded the car up the day in advance. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=229.28s)]
*  Others you know weren't weren't as prepared and it did it did create particularly we saw that particularly in the palisades. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  Just traffic jams of people abandoning their vehicles and things to get out of here different story here. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=242.32s)]
*  We've not seen that same experience and best we can tell most people here did get out of harm's way. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=248.24s)]
*  Now we heard the sheriff say they've got to go through and check because you know we don't know. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=258.08s)]
*  If you look around here it's impossible to tell what most of anything that was here was. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=263.28s)]
*  Other than we know that once there were homes now there's just a field of debris. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=271.12s)]
*  So you know when we talk about there were five deaths that's that we know of that number could be a lot higher. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=277.44s)]
*  We hope it's not you know they talk about there could be a thousand structures that were damaged or destroyed from this fire. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  We hope that number doesn't grow but it probably will. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=289.04s)]
*  There are so many things we don't know right now about these fires about the scope of them. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=291.92s)]
*  Other than I can tell you I grew up down this hill. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=296.72s)]
*  And you know this is a community that is now forever changed. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=301.44s)]
*  Things that had been here for decades things that had survived the 93 firestorm in this very area are gone. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  You know what had been the worst fire I can remember. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=314.64s)]
*  Things that survived there are gone. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=318.4s)]
*  So you know sometimes people stay because this has never happened before and it's not going to happen in their neighborhood. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=320.64s)]
*  We talked to a woman who decided to stay because she wanted to be at her house. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=326.0s)]
*  Not the best choice when things are rapidly evolving right now. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=333.84s)]
*  Fortunately we're not in a situation where we're watching home after home after home burn. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=337.84s)]
*  That was yesterday. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=343.44s)]
*  Today the winds have died down. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=344.48s)]
*  Water dropping helicopters are in the air and the number of firefighters here has grown over 800. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=346.56s)]
*  And is continuing to grow. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=354.32s)]
*  So they are taking this opportunity to go and knock down hot spots to put fires out so that if those winds come back tonight and they may. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=356.32s)]
*  That there are fewer opportunities for those embers to get in the air fly all over and start new fires. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=363.76s)]
*  But everyone I think in Pasadena and across Southern California they're holding their breath tonight. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=369.44s)]
*  That the winds aren't as forecast and if they are that a fire doesn't spark. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  But traumatized California and Chris Van Cleave as you stand there with a leveled home behind you. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=381.35999999999996s)]
*  We are mindful that so many people right now who belong to the rubble so to speak are in shelters are very best to them. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=387.35999999999996s)]
*  And our commitment at CBS News 24 7 to continue telling their stories and getting their needs out there to this nation. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=394.88s)]
*  Chris Van Cleave thank you so much. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=401.03999999999996s)]
*  We want to look at it from a different vantage point. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=402.64s)]
*  This is what it looks like from space satellite images to our monitors. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=405.35999999999996s)]
*  Show us this view from space right there and you see those flare ups. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=409.35999999999996s)]
*  That is what fire looks like all the way from space looking down on Los Angeles. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=413.68s)]
*  The palisades and Eaton fires doing the most damage right now. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=418.47999999999996s)]
*  The view from infrared cameras just show where the flames were. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=422.24s)]
*  You can see just all lit up there the before and after images also just jaw dropping. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=426.47999999999996s)]
*  We will continue bringing you the very latest images from the fires burning in Southern California. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=433.12s)]
*  That is what our monitors do. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=438.47999999999996s)]
*  They track this not only there on the ground but also from space. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=439.67999999999995s)]
*  And then let's bring in Jess and look at this from a meteorological standpoint. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=443.12s)]
*  Chris said it is a little better where he is standing for the weather. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=447.28s)]
*  He also said he was concerned about the winds later tonight. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  Coming in. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=453.2s)]
*  Because we are still under a red flag warning down in that region. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=453.76s)]
*  Relative humidity today is expected to drop down to anywhere to around 5 percent. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=457.12s)]
*  And then to add to that, yeah, forecasted winds anywhere up to around 30, 40 miles per hour just in those hills. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=460.96s)]
*  That makes it challenging as these spot fires continue to move off into these communities. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=466.47999999999996s)]
*  So let's talk about that real fast. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=471.28s)]
*  Taking a look at the current conditions widespread throughout this area. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=473.03999999999996s)]
*  We are talking about Southern California dealing with such strong Santa Ana winds. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=476.08s)]
*  And during this time of year that is not normal in this area. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=479.84s)]
*  Now some of the smaller fires like the Lydia fire or the Hearst fire still are continuing to work on containment. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=482.88s)]
*  Or the firefighters on the ground are working on containment with those ones. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=488.79999999999995s)]
*  But the larger ones in the hills closer to those communities. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=491.67999999999995s)]
*  I mean these areas got wind gusts anywhere up to around 100 miles per hour. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=494.96s)]
*  Just within the past 24 hours. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=499.52s)]
*  And yeah, as we start to see these wind gusts die down that is great news for the firefighters out there. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=501.52s)]
*  But what's happening right now, the science behind why this even occurred. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=506.47999999999996s)]
*  Those strong Santa Ana winds are fueled by two different pressure systems working against each other. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=509.59999999999997s)]
*  And I said this yesterday, it's like two gears working in opposite directions creating such a strong pressure gradient. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=514.56s)]
*  Those winds directly moving offshore and that from higher to lower elevation condenses that air and it dries it. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  And that's what fuels that fire as it continues to grow in these dry areas that haven't received much rain since gosh last May. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=526.16s)]
*  So we take a look at wind gusts all the way into the afternoon hours today. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=533.44s)]
*  We can see gusts anywhere up to around 35 to 40 miles per hour. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=536.88s)]
*  Even stronger conditions in certain communities just up into the hidden Springs area. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=540.08s)]
*  And now as we head into the early morning hours tomorrow. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=544.64s)]
*  We'll continue to watch those offshore winds change a little bit direction. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=547.6s)]
*  So it's going to start moving more in from the north and then actually what's going to happen heading into Friday afternoon. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=550.64s)]
*  It pushes inland and the reason why that's important to note is that smoke will start to swirl right back in. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=555.52s)]
*  And air quality alerts will continue impacting millions of Americans just throughout that region as we head into our weekend forecast. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=561.04s)]
*  All right, Jess, thank you. We'll talk to you a little bit later. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=567.6s)]
*  You know, we go from the skies and the radar to concerns down there on the ground. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=569.68s)]
*  If you live in the state of California, there is a word that causes you to have a lot of concern in your heart. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=573.28s)]
*  Insurance victims looking to rebuild. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=579.52s)]
*  But will they have the coverage of insurance companies? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=583.36s)]
*  Will any Californian have the coverage of insurance companies when the toll of these fires is mounted and tallied? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=585.68s)]
*  CBS News 24 7 continuing watching breaking news out of Southern California and all over the globe when we come back. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFGRsES5Fi8&t=594.0s)]
