# CIA offers employee buyouts, attorney general orders review of Trump prosecutions
**CBS News:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18)
*  President Trump will deliver remarks this morning at the National Prayer Breakfast before meeting with Republicans to discuss the federal budget. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=0.0s)]
*  Meantime, his administration continues to trim the federal government. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=6.76s)]
*  Members of the CIA were offered buyouts if they choose to resign. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  We want to expand on that story now with our CBS News senior White House correspondent, Weijia Zhang. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=15.64s)]
*  Weijia, help us understand why the CIA is being targeted here and if its employees do resign, how does that impact their operations around the world? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=20.6s)]
*  Well, Errol, this is part of an ongoing massive effort by the Trump administration to shrink the government as for exactly why the CIA is being targeted. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=30.88s)]
*  The White House has not responded to any questions about that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=40.8s)]
*  But we do know that the problem, Errol, is that according to The New York Times, the CIA handed over to the administration a list of names of recent hires who could be [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=45.64s)]
*  potentially made to leave or offered these buyouts. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=59.68s)]
*  And, you know, every time that you or I or anyone has talked to the CIA and the agents, you know, the most important thing for them is anonymity so they can do their job so people don't know their identity. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=65.56s)]
*  And there is a real concern that because this list is out there now that their work could be jeopardized, that these individuals could be targeted. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  And as far as how it could impact the operations more broadly, of course, you know, the CIA is tasked with at the end of the day protecting national security by examining all of the foreign assets, all of the potential wrongdoing by foreign actors on the US. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=87.36s)]
*  And so it could have a real impact. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=108.56s)]
*  But we also know that President Trump has talked at length about the need to reduce these federal investigative agencies. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  And meet Alweja, the newly minted attorney general, Pam Bondi has issued a slate of directives for the Justice Department. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  Help us understand what those include. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=126.24s)]
*  That's right, Errol. It's more than a dozen immediately after she was sworn into office. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=129.0s)]
*  And remember, the DOJ and the White House historically has been independent of each other and presidents have gone to great lengths to stress that that they do not work in collaboration, that the attorney general is in no way supposed to be carrying water for the president. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=133.95999999999998s)]
*  But if you look at these directives, they certainly echo the things that President Trump has spoken at length about. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  For example, her first one includes how to get rid of the weaponization of government. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  And she set up a task force that will look at all the investigations that President Trump faced, civil and criminal ones from the DOJ, from the New York office there. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=165.12s)]
*  So I think that it shows as a very important first example of sort of aligning with what the president wants. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=179.84s)]
*  She also issued several others, one to get rid of DEI programs within the Department of Justice, one that brings back the death penalty. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=189.12s)]
*  There was a moratorium on federal executions before. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=200.36s)]
*  There's one that deals with sanctuary cities that the administration, that the DOJ claims is getting in the way of their work. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  So, Errol, if you go down the line again, even though they are meant to be separate from the White House, you can see where there is overlap with things that the president himself has talked about. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=212.48s)]
*  Very good points there, Weijia. Thank you very much. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L-YkSyn18&t=224.04s)]
