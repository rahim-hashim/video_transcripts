# Musk's new threats for federal employees asked to justify their jobs
**CBS News:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM)
*  Let's start with this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=0.0s)]
*  Do they have a job or don't they? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=1.44s)]
*  There is confusion, as you might imagine, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=2.88s)]
*  from federal workers all across the country [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=4.9s)]
*  because the Office of Personnel Management said [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=6.94s)]
*  each agency can now decide on how to respond [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  to that email from Elon Musk demanding [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=12.98s)]
*  employees list five of their accomplishments. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=15.92s)]
*  This directly opposes Elon Musk's demand. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=18.54s)]
*  So let us bring in CBS News White House reporter [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=21.5s)]
*  Olivia Rinaldi. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=24.82s)]
*  She's breaking it all down for us. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=25.900000000000002s)]
*  Olivia, it's so hard to understand what's going on here [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=27.84s)]
*  because you've got Elon Musk saying that you have [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=32.16s)]
*  to respond to his request to list your five accomplishments [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=36.68s)]
*  or that will result in termination, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=40.92s)]
*  but you've got the heads of these various government [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=42.92s)]
*  agencies telling their workers that they, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  the people at the top of those organizations, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=48.24s)]
*  are going to be the ones to decide how this proceeds. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=51.06s)]
*  So what are workers supposed to do? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=53.84s)]
*  Yeah, Vlad, it really just depends what agency you're with. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=56.72s)]
*  We know that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=59.84s)]
*  told his employees that work with the agency, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=62.2s)]
*  you have to reply and you should reply. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=64.64s)]
*  But we've also heard from Tulsi Gabbard, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=67.36s)]
*  the Director of National Intelligence, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=69.36s)]
*  as well as some members of the Pentagon, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=70.76s)]
*  who told their people, because you deal with [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=72.48s)]
*  such classified information, don't reply, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=74.72s)]
*  or hold off on replying, or if you do reply, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=77.42s)]
*  do it in coordination with us so we know what you're saying. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=80.16s)]
*  But this really just does depend what agency [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=82.48s)]
*  you fall under. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=85.38s)]
*  Now, of course, you mentioned that the Office [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=86.9s)]
*  of Personnel Management told these secretaries, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=88.66s)]
*  look, it's voluntary, it's up to you, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=91.02s)]
*  it's up to your people to decide. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=92.62s)]
*  But Musk issued a new threat last night where he said, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=94.02s)]
*  basically, it's round two, if you don't reply this time, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=97.62s)]
*  we will consider this your resignation. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=101.06s)]
*  So a lot of confusion that we're seeking clarity [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=103.38s)]
*  from the White House today, but we did hear [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=106.34s)]
*  from President Trump yesterday about this very issue. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  And he was essentially asked, is there a rift [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=112.18s)]
*  between these secretaries and Elon Musk [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  about what they're essentially supposed to do [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=117.08s)]
*  with this email? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=119.28s)]
*  And he maintains that it's not these secretaries [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  going against Musk, but rather than being protective [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=123.28s)]
*  of some of the classified information that they deal with. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=126.24s)]
*  Take a listen here to what he had to say [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=128.64s)]
*  about that specifically. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=130.68s)]
*  What he's doing is saying, are you actually working? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=132.72s)]
*  And then if you don't answer, like you're sort of semi-fired [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=135.72s)]
*  or you're fired, because a lot of people are not answering [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=139.64s)]
*  because they don't even exist. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=143.3s)]
*  So there you hear the president sort of backing Elon Musk [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=146.82s)]
*  over his secretary saying, look, what he's doing [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=149.74s)]
*  is actually asking if people are actually working, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=152.74s)]
*  which is what Musk says he's doing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=156.42000000000002s)]
*  Musk also downplaying the email, saying, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=157.94s)]
*  it's just an email, this should not be such a big deal. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=160.38s)]
*  So interesting to note there that they are essentially [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=163.8s)]
*  downplaying the impact of this email that went out [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=166.16s)]
*  to 2.3 million federal workers. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=169.0s)]
*  Did the president clarify what the definition [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=171.88000000000002s)]
*  of semi-fired means? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=174.60000000000002s)]
*  I mean, am I semi-dead, am I semi-stoned, am I semi-... [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=176.60000000000002s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=180.24s)]
*  To my knowledge, he did not clarify what a semi-fired [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=182.68s)]
*  would actually mean, but it's a good question [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=185.70000000000002s)]
*  and it's something we'll be asking the White House later. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=187.88000000000002s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=190.16000000000003s)]
*  Is that these employees that are placed on administrative leave [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=191.0s)]
*  to be fired at a later date, who actually has to answer this? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=194.60000000000002s)]
*  Who is combing through what would be two million emails [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=198.44s)]
*  from federal employees explaining what they did? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=203.28s)]
*  And who gets to judge whether or not it is sufficient enough [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=207.04s)]
*  of what they're doing that would amount to keeping [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=211.76s)]
*  their job or not, or being semi-fired? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=214.88s)]
*  That's why I'm so impressed by you, Olivia, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  because you can take what is pretty much a silly question [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=220.27999999999997s)]
*  and add some seriousness to that question [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  as you would as a White House reporter. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=226.11999999999998s)]
*  I love that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=228.10000000000002s)]
*  All right, let me ask you about this judge [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=229.10000000000002s)]
*  who's upholding the White House's ban [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=230.42000000000002s)]
*  on the Associated Press's access, at least for now, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=232.26000000000002s)]
*  as it decides the merits of the case. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=235.3s)]
*  I do love that the White House press corps, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=237.06s)]
*  from what I understand, Olivia, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=239.16000000000003s)]
*  yesterday when French President Emmanuel Macron [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=241.38000000000002s)]
*  was visiting with President Trump, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=243.22000000000003s)]
*  the Associated Press had their French reporter [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=245.4s)]
*  for the Associated Press ask one of the first questions [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=248.60000000000002s)]
*  to both men, but what are you hearing about what it means [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=251.18s)]
*  for the U.S. White House representatives [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=253.70000000000002s)]
*  of the Associated Press? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=256.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, they certainly did do that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=258.96s)]
*  We did see yesterday, though, a federal judge denied [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=260.56s)]
*  this emergency motion from the Associated Press [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  that would essentially restore their access [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=266.03999999999996s)]
*  to Air Force One and the Oval Office. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=267.84s)]
*  We saw that access taken away after the Associated Press [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=270.12s)]
*  did not change their wording from Gulf of Mexico [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=274.88s)]
*  to Gulf of America. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=278.58s)]
*  They took away that access, the White House did. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  The AP sued. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=283.67999999999995s)]
*  Now, this federal judge says they want to have [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=285.32s)]
*  a full briefing on this case before making [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=287.18s)]
*  any sort of decision, but for now, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=290.02s)]
*  they denied that emergency motion. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=292.38s)]
*  We know Trump, of course, signed that executive order [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=294.62s)]
*  on his first day in office, changing the name [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=296.98s)]
*  from Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=298.9s)]
*  I do want to read a quote from the AP [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=301.7s)]
*  in a statement that they've put out. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=303.5s)]
*  They said, we will stand for the right [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=305.02s)]
*  of independent media everywhere and a ruling [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=306.98s)]
*  that reinforces the right to free speech, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=309.18s)]
*  which was the whole argument of this case. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=312.12s)]
*  And I should note that the CBS News also signed [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=314.12s)]
*  onto a letter from the White House Correspondents' [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=317.24s)]
*  Association calling for this ban to be lifted. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=319.68s)]
*  And so did, as I understand it, Olivia, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  other news organizations who are not generally [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=325.08000000000004s)]
*  considered moderate or objective, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=327.68s)]
*  including some, for example, Newsmax and others, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=332.12s)]
*  that also signed onto this letter. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  Am I right about that? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=337.24s)]
*  Yes, you are. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=338.72s)]
*  You are, Vlad. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=339.56s)]
*  Yeah, all right. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=340.48s)]
*  Olivia Rinaldi, always bringing it for us. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=341.32000000000005s)]
*  Thank you, Olivia. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=342.52s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8paaRugqM&t=343.35999999999996s)]
