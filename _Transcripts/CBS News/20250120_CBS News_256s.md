# Former Vice President Harris visits Los Angeles amid wildfires
**CBS News:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o)
*  As a new administration enters the White House, former Vice President Kamala Harris is in Los Angeles, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=0.0s)]
*  surveying the damage caused by the ongoing wildfires and meeting with first responders. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=5.8s)]
*  Let's listen to what she said earlier. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=10.4s)]
*  Some of the lucky ones. Our home is still standing. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=12.4s)]
*  We wanted to come out, and in particular to this extraordinary community, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=16.2s)]
*  and just let people know that we see them and that they are cared for. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=21.7s)]
*  And as I said to these courageous and extraordinary firefighters, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=28.7s)]
*  moments of crisis really do reveal the heroes among us. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=33.5s)]
*  We went and visited World Central Kitchen. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=36.7s)]
*  I mean, the volunteers who are there, some of them who lost their own homes, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=38.7s)]
*  are there doing the work of taking care of perfect strangers, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=43.7s)]
*  who in the face of that stranger they see a neighbor. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=48.2s)]
*  These are folks who understand the strength and the value of community, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=51.7s)]
*  which is everyone coming together with a shared sense of purpose and identity as a community of people. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=57.2s)]
*  And I just, I wanted to come by most importantly to thank them, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=64.2s)]
*  those who have volunteered and have brought people together and have sacrificed so much, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=68.2s)]
*  and our firefighters. And I mentioned to these firefighters the fact that California firefighters [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=73.2s)]
*  time and time again prove themselves to be the best at the kind of work that is about dealing with these moments of unprecedented crisis [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=80.7s)]
*  and doing it with extraordinary courage and sacrifice. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=93.7s)]
*  We know that at least a dozen or more California firefighters lost their own homes. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=97.7s)]
*  And this is the nature of who these folks are. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=103.7s)]
*  I went to paradise after the fire. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=106.7s)]
*  I have met with countless firefighters who are out there battling these blazes [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=109.7s)]
*  while they know their own homes might be at risk. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=115.7s)]
*  They do this work to protect people they've never met out of a sense of duty and, dare I say, a calling to serve, even at great personal sacrifice. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=119.7s)]
*  So we just came out to thank them, to thank the community. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=131.7s)]
*  We have a listening to Kamala Harris speak alongside her husband Doug Emhoff in Los Angeles amidst the wildfires that continue to burn. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=134.7s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News Senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=142.7s)]
*  Ed, we heard her say they're one of the lucky ones, their home is still standing, they were in the evacuation zone. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=146.7s)]
*  Tell us the timing of her visit and what she's doing while in the area. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=151.7s)]
*  Yeah, well Brentwood is where she lives. Her and Mr. Emhoff there have a home. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=154.7s)]
*  And for a few days there was touch and go. It was unclear whether her home was actually affected in any way, but ultimately it was not. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=159.7s)]
*  So she has direct experience, understanding of this situation that continues to bedevil those in Southern California [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=166.7s)]
*  and had been keenly concerned about what was going on and helping steer the federal response. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=172.7s)]
*  She canceled a trip to Asia and Europe as the president canceled his trip to the former president now to see the pope, to oversee the federal response. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=178.7s)]
*  Everything she does, however, whether it's in California or anywhere else, is going to be seen through a political lens [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=186.7s)]
*  unless or until she tells us she's not interested in running for governor of California, which is a possibility, or of course running again for president. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=193.7s)]
*  So no surprise they'd go home to Brentwood tonight after this inauguration. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=200.7s)]
*  We should point out, by the way, President and First Lady Biden also flew to California. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=205.7s)]
*  They're going to a different part of the state, up to the north a little bit from Los Angeles for some R&R. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=211.7s)]
*  But for the Emhoffs, for the vice president, it was to go to their home there in Los Angeles. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=216.7s)]
*  We expect she's going to split her time between the two coasts, California and New York, as Emhoff resumes his legal career [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=221.7s)]
*  with a firm likely that would have a presence on both coasts. And then we'll see what she decides to do, possibly running for governor. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=228.7s)]
*  She also pointed out, you saw some Secret Service agents there behind her. As an outgoing vice president, she has protection for at least another six months, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=235.7s)]
*  possibly longer if there's something more specific. It's kind of one of those things that former presidents get that protection for life. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=242.7s)]
*  Vice presidents don't get it forever. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=249.7s)]
*  Ed O'Keefe with the interesting points, as always. Thank you so much. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPg1cl7Rh3o&t=251.7s)]
