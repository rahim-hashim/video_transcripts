# Did Trump start a trade war with Mexico, Canada and China?
**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE)
*  Welcome back to CBS News 24 7. All right, so you're watching at the same time [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=0.0s)]
*  I am that is Wall Street right now and here's your headline stocks continue to tumble today [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  Following President Donald Trump's very tough talks about tariffs tariffs on Mexico Canada and China [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=9.92s)]
*  It took effect overnight and here is the effect of that right now Americans wondering what this means for their savings [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=15.76s)]
*  Maybe today is not the best day to look at your 401k [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=21.52s)]
*  World leaders are also responding with tariffs of their own [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=24.48s)]
*  So this index that you're looking at along with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 all slipping amid fears of a trade war [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=27.66s)]
*  Slipping amid fears of a trade war. So let's bring in Barron senior markets writer Paul Lamonica Paul [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=35.84s)]
*  Let's break this down walk us through what's happening in real time for people who may not [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=41.96s)]
*  Understand the complexities of the Dow one thing we all understand is that negative symbol? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=46.540000000000006s)]
*  Yeah, the Dow S&P 500 Nasdaq. Those are the three main [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=51.02s)]
*  Barometers of the stock market and they are all read [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=55.599999999999994s)]
*  Extremely lower today and that you know continues yesterday's slide [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=58.98s)]
*  Investors are worried that President Trump is actually carrying out the threats [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=64.14s)]
*  There are always I think had been a hope that a lot of this was public posturing [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=68.84s)]
*  Negotiating tactic and that at the end of the day [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=73.62s)]
*  There would be either another extension with Canada and Mexico like we saw a month ago or maybe even an outright [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=75.94s)]
*  agreement to not have these tariffs, but here we are today and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=84.28s)]
*  President Trump is showing that he is serious not just with Canada and Mexico [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=89.8s)]
*  But also with China and the big concern is that this could lift consumer prices at a time where inflation is [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=94.02s)]
*  still a major worry for a lot of consumers and investors and there's the question of what do companies do they either have to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=101.64s)]
*  Raise prices which no one likes or they eat the cost themselves which hurts profits and investors don't like that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=110.24s)]
*  Right, and I just have to ask you about this because we know you at Barron's look at money [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=117.0s)]
*  That is primarily what you talk about and leading up to this [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=121.16s)]
*  tariffs were sold to the American people on the campaign trail and then after the election as [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=124.92s)]
*  A way to increase our economic stability [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=129.28s)]
*  But today vice president JD Vance said these tariffs were to stem the tide of fentanyl coming into the United States from Canada and Mexico [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=132.14s)]
*  From your vantage point is this about money or is it about drugs? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=140.16s)]
*  It's a tough question. It does seem as if the White House is [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=143.76s)]
*  using the threat of tariffs to try and get some policies and [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=148.8s)]
*  your concessions from Canada and Mexico that aren't purely [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=154.76s)]
*  Economic in nature and that is concerning the other thing [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=159.48s)]
*  I think that you know [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=162.64s)]
*  consumers need to keep in mind is that even though the president and others in the administration like to talk about how [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=164.0s)]
*  This is something that countries pay it really is as you pointed out [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=169.89999999999998s)]
*  Something that consumers pay in the form of higher prices and something that investors pay with their 401k [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=174.85999999999999s)]
*  Balances going down is the stock market falls because of worries about corporate profits. So this isn't something that is [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=180.94s)]
*  hurting exclusively [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=188.42s)]
*  Canada Mexico and China there's a ripple effect and a lot of American savers [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=190.62s)]
*  Consumers and investors are being you know caught up in this as well [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=195.33999999999997s)]
*  Well, if I'm paying more for lumber from Canada or other goods from Mexico and China [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=199.4s)]
*  I'm reducing the amount I'm putting into my 401k [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=204.24s)]
*  We said off the top today might not be the best day to check our 401k [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=207.64s)]
*  So let's talk about just really the brass tacks what what Americans down on the ground care about and that is can I? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=211.28s)]
*  Save for the future. What is my 401k going to do for the long term? Talk to me about savings and investment savings [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=216.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=223.36s)]
*  I think that the key on days like today and we saw it during the COVID pandemic early 2020 [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=224.56s)]
*  What happened to the stock market for those who remember what happened in 2008 the banking collapse? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=231.76s)]
*  There are going to be times where the market is going to fall precipitously and it is going to feel very very scary [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=237.39999999999998s)]
*  But you don't want to panic because if you stay with stocks over the long term [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=244.72s)]
*  They do tend to come back now if your retirement is [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=250.2s)]
*  Years away that may give you a little more cause for concern [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=254.72s)]
*  But if you are young in your career just starting out do not use this as an excuse to sell stocks [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  You want to take advantage of those proverbial dips because the market does tend to grind its way higher over time [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=264.76s)]
*  And the good news is that corporate America is still healthy [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=272.48s)]
*  Consumers may be worried about inflation, but they're still spending for the long term and that should boost corporate profits and hence stock prices for [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=275.56s)]
*  You know companies like Apple [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=283.44s)]
*  Microsoft the so-called magnificent seven of the s&p 500 but also companies in many other industries outside of tech [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=285.6s)]
*  Talk to me about timelines, you know, we're hearing about all of these potential impacts people who are not necessarily politically motivated [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=293.36s)]
*  Economists are saying that the impact could be felt by the American consumer very soon [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=302.04s)]
*  When do you at Barron's feel like the American consumer? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=306.6s)]
*  Maybe buying lumber maybe paying for a house a little bit more or one study today said [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  $12,000 more per car. How soon could we feel those effects? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=314.76s)]
*  Yeah, this this could happen [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=318.76s)]
*  You know over the next few months as we see the potential retaliatory tariffs imposed from [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  Canada Mexico China. There are also worries that the European Union is next on Trump's target [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=329.2s)]
*  You know tariff target list so you could have companies in Germany France Italy [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=336.62s)]
*  Starting to raise prices as well if there are tariffs this will have ripple effects [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=343.02s)]
*  You know over the next few months the hope again though is that eventually? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=348.38s)]
*  President Trump may shift his economic focus to the other [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=354.46s)]
*  Parts of his platform that he campaigned on namely deregulation [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=358.58s)]
*  Lower taxes more stimulus that could help offset although maybe not mitigate entirely [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=363.26s)]
*  Some of the negative effects of tariffs [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=369.46s)]
*  All right. I have another question for you and it speaks to the fact that likely Americans will be paying more [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=371.82s)]
*  If I'm a retailer and I see that the consumer is willing to continue to pay more. Let's play this out [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=378.09999999999997s)]
*  Let's say the tariffs go away [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=385.06s)]
*  Let's say that they all all of the extra money that is being charged to these nations goes away [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=387.1s)]
*  Our retailers going to lower prices again to be congruent with what we hope is lower cost to the consumer [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=393.5s)]
*  Or will they just stay up there? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=400.46s)]
*  Yeah, that's a fantastic question [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=402.32s)]
*  I think that if you are a retailer if you are a restaurant a company like Chipotle [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=404.42s)]
*  Which is said so far that they're gonna try and keep prices down even though avocados [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=410.26s)]
*  May go up sharply because of the tariffs on Mexico. I think consumers are [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=414.82s)]
*  Increasingly savvy because of the experience of the past couple of years with inflation that came out of the pandemic [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=420.22s)]
*  I think many companies that would try and keep prices high [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=426.5s)]
*  May pay the price themselves because I think there'll be a competitor that will probably look to come out and curry favor [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=431.86s)]
*  Get some goodwill from the American consumer and say hey good news [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=438.42s)]
*  We're lowering prices and if any of our competitors keep them higher, you know, you know what to do don't shop there [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=442.38s)]
*  So I'm hopeful that companies won't use right the excuse of some of these potential transitory higher prices [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=448.7s)]
*  To keep prices higher indefinite. I hadn't thought about that [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=455.62s)]
*  But this environment could create a space for a new kid on the block so to speak who says hey [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=458.82s)]
*  I can do it for cheaper come over and play with me. I want to get your reaction to this just a moment ago [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=463.96s)]
*  The president posted on social media this in response to what Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had to say [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=469.52s)]
*  Please explain to Governor Trudeau. He says of Canada, by the way, these are the president's words against about the Prime Minister [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=477.96s)]
*  He calls him the governor of Canada that when he puts on a retaliatory tariff on the US [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=483.96s)]
*  Our reciprocal tariff will immediately in cry increase by a like amount [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=487.71999999999997s)]
*  Exclamation point used there by the by the president if that's not a trade war. I don't know what is [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=493.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, this this is a trade war plain and simple Warren Buffett said over the weekend that he was worried that it would be a trade [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=498.76s)]
*  War and what impact that would have on the US economy. I don't think there's really any way [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=506.56s)]
*  Around it, you know and you know some of the president's [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=511.92s)]
*  Sarcastic comments about Canada the 51st state and what-have-you. I don't think that changes the economic reality [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=515.84s)]
*  which is that you're going to see higher prices as a consumer and [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=522.84s)]
*  Potentially lower short-term profits if you're an investor from some of the companies in the s&p 500 that you know [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=527.48s)]
*  If you have a 401k, you probably have an s&p 500 index fund is one of your top choices [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=533.84s)]
*  This is not really good news for anyone frankly, right and politically the ramifications [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=539.28s)]
*  They're are fascinating to me because there's that old phrase. It's about the economy stupid this president elected overwhelmingly [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=545.7s)]
*  Because people were very concerned about the economy. Thank you so much for that conversation [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=552.52s)]
*  We appreciate it. Hope to see you back here on CBS. Thank you for seven [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs6CaNHSuBE&t=556.44s)]
