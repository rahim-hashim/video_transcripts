# Trudeau slams Trump's tariffs as stocks plunge
**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ)
*  All right, perhaps the top you see it in real time stocks down as companies and investors react to Trump tariffs on Mexico [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Canada and China [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=6.66s)]
*  So here's what world leaders woke up to today for Canada and Mexico [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=8.32s)]
*  25% import tax on goods that come into the United States also a [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=13.16s)]
*  10% tax on Canadian energy imports now for China [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=17.88s)]
*  Tariffs ratcheted up to 20% total. Here's the president explaining this move [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=21.72s)]
*  Gonna be very costly for people to take advantage of this country [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=27.3s)]
*  they can't come in and steal our money and steal our jobs and take our factories and take our businesses and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=31.5s)]
*  Expect not to be punished and they're being punished by tariffs. It's a very powerful [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=38.42s)]
*  Weapon that politicians haven't used because they were either dishonest [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=44.82s)]
*  stupid or [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=49.74s)]
*  paid off in some other form and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=51.260000000000005s)]
*  Now we're using them [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=53.86s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Lana Zach is in Windsor, Canada just across the border from the Motor City of Detroit [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=56.5s)]
*  No doubt a lot of automakers are watching this closely Lana the Canadian Prime Minister very pointed in his world address in the last hour [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=62.019999999999996s)]
*  Absolutely, so reciprocal tariffs from Canada [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=71.58s)]
*  25% has been levied on 30 billion dollars worth of American goods and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=74.58s)]
*  Trudeau says that the United States and the Trump administration [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=79.9s)]
*  Specifically has 21 days to remove those tariffs on Canada before US goods coming over here across the border [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=82.98s)]
*  To the tune of 155 billion dollars are also hit with those reciprocal tariffs [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=90.10000000000001s)]
*  Trudeau says it is a lose lose situation. Take a listen [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=96.10000000000001s)]
*  together to ensure even greater prosperity for North Americans in a very [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=100.9s)]
*  uncertain and challenging world [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=107.62s)]
*  Now it's not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=112.06s)]
*  But Donald they point out that even though you're a very smart guy [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=116.3s)]
*  This is a very dumb thing to do [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=121.5s)]
*  Those may be seen as fighting words read as you know, President Trump cares very much about his reputation and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=126.94s)]
*  For Trudeau who is an ally to say that he's a smart guy [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=135.3s)]
*  But it's a dumb move that might be seen as [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=139.18s)]
*  Escalatory language and we'll have to see what then happens from the Trump administration [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=143.01999999999998s)]
*  But we do know that Canada says they will not back down [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=146.94s)]
*  They've always seen themselves as partners with the United States and all this and let me just point something out to you [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=150.14s)]
*  This is the ambassador bridge 2.3 billion dollar 2.3 million trucks go over that bridge every single year [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=155.22s)]
*  it is no different than moving between [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=163.22s)]
*  New York and New Jersey in many ways in terms of how much the industries rely on each other particularly [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=166.18s)]
*  When you note that that's Detroit right over there and a lot of those parts are manufactured right here [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=171.98s)]
*  Well, and also Lana I think of construction costs in the United States because we also know that going over that bridge Canadian lumber [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=176.98s)]
*  We're also reading today that housing costs could go up as a result of this [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=183.98s)]
*  What are some of the touch points the pain points that Americans should start to brace for? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=187.98s)]
*  Well a lot of manufacturing of parts [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=192.85999999999999s)]
*  Take place here and let me tell you something that I just got from [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=195.85999999999999s)]
*  The CEO of Laval Industries when I was talking to him about this [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=199.66s)]
*  We think made in America means that the product is completely manufactured in the United States [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=203.66s)]
*  But that's not actually the case each of those component parts [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=208.66s)]
*  Get manufactured in different places and then a lot of times assembled in the United States [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=212.66s)]
*  So what is made in America it might have gone past this border five times [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=218.34s)]
*  And each one of those times has the potential now to add [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=223.34s)]
*  25% of tariffs and that's going to apply to manufactured goods is going to apply to the auto industry [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=226.34s)]
*  It's going to apply as you say to construction also in my home state of Iowa [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=232.34s)]
*  There is a lot of concern about fertilizer potash that [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=236.34s)]
*  80 to 90 percent of the potash is going to be used in the United States [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=241.34s)]
*  The 20% of the potash that is used by farmers in the United States comes from here in Canada [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=247.02s)]
*  And if there's a 25% levy put on that on the wholesale prices [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=253.02s)]
*  The margins for American farmers cannot support that without it all being passed on to American consumers [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=257.02s)]
*  Well you see Justin Trudeau digging in his heels wanting to work with the United States [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=263.02s)]
*  You see on the other side of that bridge President Donald Trump digging in his heels [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=268.02s)]
*  Is this now going to be called a trade war? Are we definitely in a trade war? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=272.7s)]
*  Yeah this is a trade war right there's no mincing words at this point [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=278.7s)]
*  It could be ended relatively soon we saw that there was a pause before [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=282.7s)]
*  We thought we were going to enter into the trade war [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=286.7s)]
*  But at this point it is active especially with Canada taking that reciprocal action [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=288.7s)]
*  And promising a further escalation if the Trump administration doesn't pull back [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=292.7s)]
*  We just heard from the Prime Minister that he addressed specifically the American people [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=298.38s)]
*  And he wanted to say that this isn't anything that Canada wants to do [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=304.38s)]
*  But they feel like it is necessary [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=309.38s)]
*  Lana, Zach, fascinating yes I noted that as well pretty fascinating when one world leader speaks to the citizens of another nation [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=311.38s)]
*  Thank you so much for that report across the bridge there and showing us the impacts [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGs66j6uvPQ&t=318.38s)]
