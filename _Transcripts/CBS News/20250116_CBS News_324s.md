# Mixed emotions, uncertainty in Israel over potential Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal
**CBS News:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw)
*  We want to return now to our top story in the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=0.0s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused Hamas of backtracking on elements of the deal, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=4.24s)]
*  but Deputy National Security Advisor Jonathan Finer joined us on CBS Mornings earlier and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=8.96s)]
*  expressed confidence in the deal. Well, what I can tell you is we fully expect the deal to proceed [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=13.6s)]
*  as described yesterday and on the timeline that we have laid out. So implementation beginning as [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=19.12s)]
*  soon as Sunday with the ceasefire and the release of the first hostages. What's being discussed now [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=24.64s)]
*  is what was described by the mediators yesterday when they announced the deal, which is a set of [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=30.16s)]
*  implementation details and conditions that are going to be a challenge throughout the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=34.96s)]
*  implementation of this deal, which is going to extend well into the next administration. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=39.52s)]
*  That is always an issue when you're talking about complex deals that have a number of facets and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=43.28s)]
*  when you're talking about, frankly, two parties who have zero trust in each other. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News contributor Robert Berger for more. So Robert, what's the reaction [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=53.68000000000001s)]
*  that you're hearing in Israel as this deal is held up? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=59.76s)]
*  The best way to describe it here is mixed emotions, because this is just a partial deal. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=65.44s)]
*  This is the first phase of a deal. Of course, everyone is delighted to see the possible release [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=72.32s)]
*  of 33 Israeli hostages. The problem is that there are an additional 65 Israeli hostages that are [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=77.92s)]
*  still being held in Gaza that are not part of this deal, and their fate is unclear. There's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=86.88s)]
*  no guarantees that they're going to be returned home. That negotiation over the second phase, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=93.6s)]
*  this is supposed to start in a couple of weeks, but the concern here in Israel is that this could [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=99.92s)]
*  drag on and on just like the first phase. There's a lot of doubt also about whether Hamas would be [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  really willing to release those remaining 65 hostages. So I would say there's a feeling [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=112.08s)]
*  of uncertainty and also people not happy to see the release of Palestinian militants, hundreds [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=119.36s)]
*  that have been involved and convicted of deadly terrorist attacks on Israelis. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  Could the reason that we're seeing concerns of the deal falling through, could that be the pushback [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=136.0s)]
*  from the far-right faction of Israel? We know that that's been a source of contention for a lot of [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  folks. What are you hearing on the ground? Yeah, for sure. There are actually two right-wing [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=149.2s)]
*  parties in the government, but one in particular led by Betzalel Smoczric, the Treasury Minister, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  far-right, is very unhappy with this deal and actually threatening to quit the government, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  saying that, okay, we're okay with the first phase, but after that, he wants a guarantee from [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=169.44s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel would actually go back to war to destroy Hamas. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=177.6s)]
*  That was, of course, one of the goals of the war, which has not been achieved. Perhaps Netanyahu [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  will give some kind of verbal approval to that. He obviously can't do that publicly. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=191.67999999999998s)]
*  The feeling is, though—and also, there's a disagreement over some of the Palestinian [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=197.68s)]
*  prisoners. That's a disagreement with Hamas over which of these top militants might be released. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=202.0s)]
*  But the feeling here is that probably today, sometime later today, these problems will [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  get resolved and Netanyahu will be able to convene the cabinet and approve the deal and then set the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=217.44s)]
*  whole process in motion. Robert, I know that in the reporting that I saw yesterday on the evening [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=224.08s)]
*  news and this morning on CBS Morning is that the families of those hostages are incredibly hopeful [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  that they will be able to see their loved ones. But from an outsider's perspective, when you look [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=236.4s)]
*  at the number of hostages that Hamas is holding, all innocent people versus the number of prisoners [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  that are being released—now, I understand that there may be some prisoners who are in an Israeli [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=248.16000000000003s)]
*  prison for simply lobbying Iraq and an Israeli soldier, but there are also actual criminals and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=253.36s)]
*  terrorists in some of those prisons. Can you just give me the number of Palestinian prisoners that [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=258.88s)]
*  are expected to be released as part of this deal and how people feel about that? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=264.64s)]
*  Okay, so in the first phase, about 1,000 Palestinian prisoners are going to be released in [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=271.44s)]
*  exchange for those 33 hostages. Of course, very lopsided numbers, but Israel is really famous for [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=276.72s)]
*  that. It's done it before, back in 2011, trading one Israeli soldier for 1,027 prisoners, including [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  Yechia Sanwar, who became the leader of Hamas and orchestrated the October 7 terrorist attack. So [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=293.20000000000005s)]
*  there's obviously big concern about these releases, but it's something—I guess it's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=300.88s)]
*  seen in Israel as the price you have to pay for that failure [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=309.36s)]
*  on October 7 when all of those hostages were taken into Gaza. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=313.12s)]
*  Indeed. All right, Robert Berger for us. Always great to have you, my friend. Thank you very much. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=318.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxUQ9pavxBw&t=323.52000000000004s)]
