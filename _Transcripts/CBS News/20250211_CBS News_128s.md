# NTSB investigating deadly crash of plane owned by Mötley Crüe's Vince Neil
**CBS News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY)
*  The NTSB is investigating the deadly crash at an airport in Scottsdale, Arizona. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=0.0s)]
*  This video shows the moment that a private jet hit a parked plane as it was attempting [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=4.16s)]
*  to land. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=7.66s)]
*  At least one person died and three people were injured. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=8.66s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News senior transportation correspondent Chris Van Cleave for the very [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=11.0s)]
*  latest. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=15.1s)]
*  So Chris, good to see you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=16.1s)]
*  What are investigators saying about the crash at this time? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=17.8s)]
*  Well, Vlad, the NTSB investigation really just getting underway here. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=20.88s)]
*  You know, as you know, those tend to be a long process. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  So we're at the very beginning of that. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=30.52s)]
*  We do know that two people were rushed to trauma centers here with critical injuries [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=32.3s)]
*  after this crash. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=38.4s)]
*  A fifth person essentially walked away from it, declined medical transport to a hospital [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=39.8s)]
*  after being checked out here. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=45.28s)]
*  So in total, five people, one person killed, two critically injured, a third taken to the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=47.019999999999996s)]
*  hospital with what was described as non-life threatening injuries and one person lucky [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=53.839999999999996s)]
*  enough to essentially walk away from this collision. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=58.26s)]
*  The plane was coming in from Austin. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=61.04s)]
*  It is a private jet owned by Vince Neil. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=63.28s)]
*  He is the lead singer of Motley Crue. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=66.0s)]
*  He was not on board the airplane at the time. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  And basically what it appears happened, the plane touched down as it was coming down the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=71.92s)]
*  runway. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=76.56s)]
*  The plane appears, the left rear landing gear collapsed, causing the plane to veer off the runway. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=78.12s)]
*  Some preliminary flight data shows it was going about 63 miles an hour or so as it went [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=84.44s)]
*  off the runway and collided with that parked private jet. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=89.98s)]
*  Chris, quickly, how often does the FAA require private jets to be inspected and to receive [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=94.4s)]
*  maintenance? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=99.4s)]
*  That really depends on what kind of maintenance. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=102.64s)]
*  There are light maintenance checks, there are heavy maintenance checks, so it depends [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=106.44000000000001s)]
*  on usage, how many hours the plane has been in the air, how many cycles are on the engine [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  and the gear. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  So it's not like every month it really depends on use of the aircraft. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=117.48s)]
*  Alright, Chris Van Cleef for us. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=123.76s)]
*  Chris, thank you very much. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=126.12s)]
*  Appreciate it, my friend. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIm0r6XnVLY&t=127.12s)]
