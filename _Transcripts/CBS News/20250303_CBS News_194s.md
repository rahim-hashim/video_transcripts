# Pope Francis suffers "acute respiratory failure" episodes, Vatican says
**CBS News:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg)
*  Here's a live look at Vatican City where we are following breaking news on the health [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=0.0s)]
*  of Pope Francis. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=4.5s)]
*  The Vatican says the pontiff suffered two episodes of acute respiratory failure today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=6.24s)]
*  This latest health scare comes more than two weeks into the Pope's hospital stay in Rome [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=12.1s)]
*  as he battles double pneumonia. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=16.96s)]
*  The Vatican says his prognosis today remains very guarded. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=19.48s)]
*  CBS News Senior Four correspondent Seth Doane joins us live from Rome. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=24.04s)]
*  Seth, what do we know about the Pope's condition right now? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=27.96s)]
*  Well, Liz, after some relatively encouraging news in recent days, we're getting this discouraging, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=34.76s)]
*  more worrying news tonight of these two episodes of acute respiratory failure today. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=40.2s)]
*  I have to look at my notes as they just came in, caused by a buildup of mucus and spasms [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=46.16s)]
*  in the airways in his lung. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=52.2s)]
*  Two bronchoscopies had to be performed. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  When a flexible probe is inserted into the lungs for them to be able to look around and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=57.76s)]
*  to do that, the Pope had to be aspirated. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=61.92s)]
*  They had to remove some of the excess mucus and fluids in his lung. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=64.24s)]
*  The Pope was then administered oxygen, which we understand through Vatican sources was [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=69.44s)]
*  by face mask. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=73.64s)]
*  He's been alternating different ways of getting that oxygen, but the Vatican has underlined [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=74.64s)]
*  that it is non-invasive, meaning that he did not have to be intubated. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=79.8s)]
*  Underlines the Pope has remained aware and alert. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=85.2s)]
*  Our Vatican sources tell us that there was some good news, which we've seen also in recent [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=89.72s)]
*  days that that white blood cell count has remained the same and elevated white blood [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=94.76s)]
*  cell count could be an indication of infection. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=101.92s)]
*  So a bit of more encouraging news in this rather discouraging term, though this turn, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=104.72s)]
*  this immediate crisis is over. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  This underlines just how complex the Pope's medical situation is. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  It has been a bit of a roller coaster there, Seth. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=118.91999999999999s)]
*  What reactions are you seeing from the Catholic community? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=121.83999999999999s)]
*  I know this news just came down, but even over the weekend. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=124.91999999999999s)]
*  Well, what we're hearing is that it's a tense time. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=132.16s)]
*  We're hearing it from priests, we're hearing it from parishioners, we're hearing it from [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=135.24s)]
*  pilgrims, as you know, are behind me here. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=139.04s)]
*  St. Peter's Square every evening, there's been a prayer, a rosary around nine o'clock [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=142.16s)]
*  local time where people have been coming to pray for Pope Francis. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=146.4s)]
*  Just earlier in the day, I was here on the terrace where we are and I heard someone call [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  out for prayers for Pope Francis. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=153.64s)]
*  At Mass, we were there yesterday at the American, where Americans celebrate Mass here in Rome [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=156.28s)]
*  at a church. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=161.8s)]
*  And the first thing the priest said was, let's pray for Pope Francis. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=163.72s)]
*  So clearly he is in the thoughts of people, of pilgrims. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=166.64s)]
*  30 million people expected to come here for this Jubilee year. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=169.88s)]
*  Many trying to walk through the Holy Door that's only open every 25 years. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=174.6s)]
*  It's a big year of celebration and penance, a time that is bringing pilgrims to Rome. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=179.0s)]
*  And many come wanting to see the Pope and at this point, hoping, praying for the Pope [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=184.16s)]
*  to get well. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=189.24s)]
*  All right, Seth Doane, live for us from Rome. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=190.24s)]
*  Thank you so much for that update. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4-TuqByzg&t=192.92s)]
