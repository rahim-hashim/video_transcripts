# What to know about Trump's pause on tariffs for Mexico and Canada
**CBS News:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY)
*  Let's bring in CBS News correspondent Natalie Brand, who joins us from the White House to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=0.0s)]
*  talk more about Mexico and Canada, which Natalie, as you know, made those last-minute deals, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=3.6s)]
*  some are calling it deals. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  The president is calling it a deal to postpone the tariff threat. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=10.700000000000001s)]
*  So first, let's talk about what the president is saying, and then let's talk about the reality [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=14.24s)]
*  on the ground. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=18.2s)]
*  Well, good to be with you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=19.2s)]
*  Yeah, the White House touting this as a win as the leaders of Mexico and Canada promised [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=21.52s)]
*  some increased security around the border. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=27.48s)]
*  Mexico's president, Shin-Bom, promising 10,000 National Guard troops there as the White House [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=31.8s)]
*  really threatened these tariffs to try to elicit more action in terms of curbing the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=39.8s)]
*  flow of illegal migrants and drugs. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=45.0s)]
*  But we do know, Vlad, that Mexico had really begun beefing up enforcement around the border [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=48.34s)]
*  Last year, even under the Biden administration, putting troops on the border to try to, again, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=56.22s)]
*  address what had been unprecedented levels of migration, that situation has really tamped [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=63.14s)]
*  down in recent months, even before President Trump took office. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=72.98s)]
*  As for Canada and its announcement, additional frontline personnel, technology, a commitment [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=77.82000000000001s)]
*  to appoint a fentanyl czar, some new initiatives, but also initiatives that had been previously [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=84.82000000000001s)]
*  announced months ago. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=92.94s)]
*  So some experts are seeing the concessions here as not as much, but we'll have to wait [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=94.62s)]
*  and see what happens over the next 30 days. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=100.9s)]
*  That is the period of time during which the tariffs are on pause for now. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=105.54s)]
*  For those tariffs on China that you were just talking about with Kelly, I spoke to a former [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  deputy chief economist at the State Department under the Biden administration, Philip Luck, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  and asked him what he expects from the negotiations between the U.S. and China. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=124.14s)]
*  We know President Trump is expected to soon talk to Chinese President Xi, as early as [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=130.64s)]
*  today, potentially. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=137.32s)]
*  So I asked him what is he expecting from those conversations? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=138.52s)]
*  Could there be a compromise there? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=142.58s)]
*  Tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been dramatically economically impactful. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=144.12s)]
*  They would have raised costs to U.S. consumers by what was estimated to more than $1,500 [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=149.08s)]
*  per family per year. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  These tariffs will be impactful. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=155.86s)]
*  They will raise prices. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=157.24s)]
*  We will pay most of them. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=158.44s)]
*  But they will not be as impactful as the tariffs on Canada and Mexico would have been. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=160.98000000000002s)]
*  And Philip Luck there raised the question, which other experts are raising as well. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=167.7s)]
*  The threat of tariffs or imposition of tariffs, is this the administration trying to change [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=173.26s)]
*  trade policy with respect to these countries, or is it being used as a tool, a leverage [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=178.89999999999998s)]
*  in a negotiation, Vlad? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=186.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's really fascinating. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=188.66s)]
*  I know the White House is signaling when it comes to Mexico that it's a win, but the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=190.42s)]
*  reporting from us and other news organizations is that the Mexican government had already [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=195.58s)]
*  promised President Joe Biden to send some 15,000 troops to the border back in 2021. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=199.58s)]
*  They also did it back in 2019 when President Trump threatened tariffs at that time to Mexico. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=205.82000000000002s)]
*  So it's not exactly clear, other than the president being able to say that he's got [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=210.96s)]
*  a win, that anything is going to change on the Mexican side, because they already have, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=215.14000000000001s)]
*  as you say, Natalie, those troops on the border. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=219.02s)]
*  So let's talk now about what's happening at the White House this afternoon with Israeli [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=222.26s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=226.48s)]
*  Yeah, this will be the first joint press conference with a foreign leader. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=228.54s)]
*  The fact that it's Israel's prime minister, both countries saying that signals the significance [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=234.01999999999998s)]
*  of this relationship, an extremely close relationship between these two leaders and countries. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  critical time when the Trump administration will have to continue to mediate and help [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=248.42s)]
*  negotiate this phase two of the very fragile ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=255.06s)]
*  Phase two is when there's hope that all the Israeli hostages will be released and there's [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=262.3s)]
*  more definitive answer as to how this war ends and what happens in Gaza. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=268.74s)]
*  That is a big question. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=276.84s)]
*  The future of Gaza, what happens to the Palestinian people? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=277.84s)]
*  That is what these leaders, some of the questions they will be asked today. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=281.0s)]
*  All right, we'll be watching Natalie Brand for us. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=284.56s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYsu5oCrgzY&t=287.08s)]
