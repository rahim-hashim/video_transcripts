# Kansas seeing largest tuberculosis outbreak in U.S. history, dozens of cases reported
**CBS News:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I)
*  Kansas is currently experiencing the largest ever reported outbreak of tuberculosis in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. history. As of last Friday, 67 active cases have been reported in the Kansas City [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=7.92s)]
*  area. An additional 79 people have been reported to have latent infections of tuberculosis [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  since 2024. Most cases have been in Wyandotte County. State health officials say there is [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  a quote, very low risk to the general public. Hmm, is that right? For more on this, we're [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=25.28s)]
*  joined now by Dr. William Schaffner. He's a professor of preventative medicine at Vanderbilt [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  University School of Medicine. So, doctor, what might be causing this outbreak? And while [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=35.04s)]
*  they say there's a low risk to the public, how concerned should we all be? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=40.64s)]
*  Well, Errol, good morning. Yes, it is a large outbreak of tuberculosis. This illness is [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=44.84s)]
*  caused by a germ of bacteria that infects the lungs and usually produces a chronic kind [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=52.559999999999995s)]
*  of infection that over time, in addition to the cough that it classically produces, you [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=60.44s)]
*  generally lose some weight, feel poorly, and you may get some night sweats. Also, and this [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=67.44s)]
*  can go on for some time, it usually is spread through prolonged contact with other people [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=74.08s)]
*  who have tuberculosis. I think the general public need not be very concerned. Local state [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=81.72s)]
*  health department officials, along with help from the CDC, are on the ground contacting [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=88.88s)]
*  all the contacts of people who have had tuberculosis, testing them, and if found positive, offering [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=95.36s)]
*  them treatment. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=103.84s)]
*  OK, so you said a cough there and some other symptoms. And we saw on the map that this is [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=106.4s)]
*  bordering Missouri as well. But it sounds like you're saying no major reason to be concerned [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=110.96s)]
*  at the moment. And before we let you go, I know officials have identified a rare strain of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=116.16s)]
*  bird flu at a duck farm in California. What do we know about that? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=120.24s)]
*  Well, we're looking very hard for odd variants of this bird flu. And the harder we look with [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=126.32s)]
*  our scientific capacity today, the more we'll find variants of this bird flu virus that's out [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=134.36s)]
*  there. The important thing to remember is it has not yet at least acquired the capacity to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  infect people, humans readily or to be transmitted readily from person to person. So far, so good. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  And I keep looking. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=158.56s)]
*  Right. And I'm glad you're keeping our attention on this. And I'm not sure if you can answer the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=159.88000000000002s)]
*  question, but does this have anything to do with the jump in egg prices, the fear over this and the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=163.76s)]
*  concern? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=168.72s)]
*  Well, Errol, it certainly does, because this bird flu virus has gotten into poultry flocks and those [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  layer hens that produce our eggs have been affected. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  So some of those, many of those flocks have been taken out of production and until new flocks grow up so [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=181.95999999999998s)]
*  that they're large enough for those hens to lay eggs, I'm afraid eggs are going to be in somewhat short supply. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=189.2s)]
*  And now folks know why eggs are so expensive these days. Dr. William Schaffner, appreciate you waking up with us [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=195.84s)]
*  from Nashville, Tennessee. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUzJaREG_I&t=200.88s)]
