# Trump's Education Department executive order may impact millions of students
**CBS News:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY)
*  But for now, let's begin on the ground. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=0.0s)]
*  You're seeing the White House there. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=2.96s)]
*  More than 100 million students in these United States [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=4.76s)]
*  face this reality, the potential and complete overhaul [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=7.42s)]
*  of the Department of Education. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  Sources confirming to CBS News President Donald Trump [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=12.6s)]
*  will sign an executive order to dismantle that department. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  It appears not a question of if, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=18.72s)]
*  but rather a question of when. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=20.52s)]
*  Not today, according to the people we're talking to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=21.84s)]
*  at the White House. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=24.34s)]
*  But you know, part of the work of the Department of Education [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=25.18s)]
*  helps 26 million children who live in poverty, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=28.36s)]
*  7.5 million students with disabilities. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=32.16s)]
*  The department also helps 10 million students [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=35.28s)]
*  who rely on financial aid to attend college [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=37.2s)]
*  and pursue a trade. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=39.32s)]
*  The Department of Education gives billions [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=41.02s)]
*  to fund high poverty K through 12 schools, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=42.84s)]
*  15.5 billion to help cover education [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  for children with disabilities, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=48.7s)]
*  and $1.6 trillion for federal student loan programs. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=50.0s)]
*  Now here's the blowback. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=54.92s)]
*  Randy Weingarten leads the American Federation of Teachers [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=56.4s)]
*  calling for the Trump administration [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=59.0s)]
*  not to quote, attack the children living in poverty [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=60.44s)]
*  and the children with disabilities to pay for vouchers [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=63.4s)]
*  and tax cuts for billionaires, close quote. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=65.96s)]
*  Now keep in mind, eliminating the Department of Education [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=68.56s)]
*  has to happen in Congress. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=71.32s)]
*  So we went to Congress. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=73.28s)]
*  We asked the House Speaker about the headline. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  So, Mayor Johnson, do you have any concerns [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=78.4s)]
*  about an EEO abolishing the Department of Education? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  I haven't had a chance to review it yet, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=83.24s)]
*  but I'll tell you that the more we push control of education [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=84.48s)]
*  down to parents and local school boards and authorities, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=87.84s)]
*  the better off we are. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=90.2s)]
*  And I think it's an innovation. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  So let's go live to Washington [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=94.16s)]
*  and CBS News Chief White House correspondent, Nancy Cordes. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  Nancy, good to see you. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=98.26s)]
*  So the executive order yet to come, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=99.18s)]
*  it speaks to presidential power, right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  But we know Congress has to be on board. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=103.36s)]
*  Is that order we expect from the president [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=106.12s)]
*  and seem to be marching orders for Congress? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  It's marching orders for his new Secretary of Education, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=111.2s)]
*  Linda McMahon Reid, and he is going to order her, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=114.32s)]
*  according to our sources, to do whatever she can [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=118.16s)]
*  to dismantle the agency [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=121.64s)]
*  without actually getting rid of it altogether, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  because as you point out, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=127.08s)]
*  that would take an act of Congress. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=128.0s)]
*  But as we've seen with USAID, for example, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=130.68s)]
*  there's a lot that Trump administration can try to do [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=134.0s)]
*  to dramatically downsize these agencies [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=137.76s)]
*  without Congress being involved [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  and then sort of letting the chips fall [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=146.67999999999998s)]
*  where they may legally [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  if and when they've overstepped their bounds. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  When it comes to the Department of Education, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=153.66s)]
*  it's a little unclear exactly how the Trump administration [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  would achieve this, because as you pointed out, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=160.76s)]
*  the lion's share of the Department of Education budget [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=164.12s)]
*  goes to a few big programs that are broadly popular. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=167.2s)]
*  They send a lot of money to schools in low-income areas [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=171.92s)]
*  to sort of help them level the playing field. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  They send a lot of money to school districts [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=178.56s)]
*  so that kids with disability [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=180.64s)]
*  who are more expensive sometimes to educate [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=183.04s)]
*  can get a quality education. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  They distribute Pell grants. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=187.98s)]
*  So what we're trying to understand [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=190.04s)]
*  is whether the president is looking to eliminate [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=192.17999999999998s)]
*  or downsize these grant programs, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=195.72s)]
*  or is he just saying we wanna send those grants [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=198.04s)]
*  to some other department, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=201.22s)]
*  maybe have Health and Human Services [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=202.28s)]
*  administer those grants instead [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=204.96s)]
*  so that we can downsize the Department of Education? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=207.28s)]
*  And if that's the case, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=210.22s)]
*  what would you really be gaining [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=212.04s)]
*  from reconfiguring things that way? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=214.22s)]
*  Right, and who would be in control [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=216.36s)]
*  in those other departments if it shifts? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=217.66s)]
*  And I'm remembering what Linda McMahon said [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=219.56s)]
*  in her confirmation hearings, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=221.34s)]
*  the mandate from President Trump [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=223.96s)]
*  to work herself out of a job. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=225.08s)]
*  So with all of the procedural roadblocks [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=226.7s)]
*  that we can potentially see, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=229.08s)]
*  with all of just the blowbacks [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=230.28s)]
*  by way of the social conversation, the narrative, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=232.38s)]
*  how likely are we to see this happening? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=235.4s)]
*  Well, there's a misconception out there right now, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=239.0s)]
*  and you heard it to some degree from the House speaker [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=242.04s)]
*  in the clip that you played [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=245.52s)]
*  that somehow the Department of Education [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=246.56s)]
*  is dictating educational standards [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=249.12s)]
*  to state and local school districts, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  and that if only the DOE were to be out of the way, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=255.2s)]
*  that all that power would revert to the states. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=259.15999999999997s)]
*  The Department of Education does not do that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=262.03999999999996s)]
*  It doesn't impose any educational standards [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=263.92s)]
*  on states, on local school districts. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=266.68s)]
*  It, for the most part, either hands out money, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  or it funds research at a national level [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=273.24s)]
*  so that the schools in states [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=277.52s)]
*  can be informed of best practices [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=281.47999999999996s)]
*  and what works and what hasn't. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=284.08s)]
*  We know that DOE has already gone into DOE [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  and cut a lot of the funding for those research programs. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=290.12s)]
*  So that research is no longer being funded. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=293.79999999999995s)]
*  The question is now do they really wanna go ahead [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=296.47999999999996s)]
*  and cut funding for schools in low-income areas? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=300.28s)]
*  That's something that you'd probably get [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=304.38s)]
*  a lot of pushback from governors in a lot of states [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=306.14s)]
*  if they tried to do that. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=311.02s)]
*  So exactly what they're going to set out to do, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=312.38s)]
*  how they would accomplish it, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=316.14s)]
*  and what it would mean for students, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=317.34s)]
*  still very unclear. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=319.21999999999997s)]
*  So for viewers who may be tuning in [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=320.53999999999996s)]
*  and seeing that headline there on the screen, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=322.38s)]
*  we had word today that that executive order [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=324.58s)]
*  could happen today. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=326.82s)]
*  Now we're understanding there might be [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=328.02s)]
*  a little bit of a pause. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=329.34s)]
*  That does not mean it's not going to happen. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=330.41999999999996s)]
*  So we'll put that aside right now. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=332.18s)]
*  But I wanna pivot to this. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=333.74s)]
*  The Trump administration getting a big win [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=335.22s)]
*  with an appeals court, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=337.1s)]
*  allowing the firing of a whistleblower, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=338.70000000000005s)]
*  the agency head who blew the whistle. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=342.34000000000003s)]
*  What can you tell us about that? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=344.1s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=345.82000000000005s)]
*  So his name is Hampton Dellinger. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=346.74s)]
*  He is the US Special Counsel. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=348.62s)]
*  He basically has a very specific role [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=352.62s)]
*  within the federal government to protect whistleblowers, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=355.62s)]
*  to protect federal workers when they come forward [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=359.26000000000005s)]
*  to report waste, fraud, and abuse, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=362.5s)]
*  and to look out for federal workers [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=365.9s)]
*  and their rights more generally. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=368.78s)]
*  Well, he himself was fired in February [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=370.42s)]
*  by the Trump administration, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=374.1s)]
*  and he pushed back. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=375.5s)]
*  He said, you don't actually have the legal right [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=376.42s)]
*  to fire me just because you don't like what I'm doing. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=379.94s)]
*  You have to fire me for very specific reasons, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=383.34s)]
*  like if I'm not performing properly. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=386.46s)]
*  And so it went to court. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=389.26s)]
*  And a federal judge sided with him. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=390.62s)]
*  But now today an appeals court has said, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=394.22s)]
*  no, actually the Trump administration [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=396.42s)]
*  does have the right to remove him. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=398.1s)]
*  So this is probably going to go to the Supreme Court. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=400.14s)]
*  This is probably not the last legal step in this case. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=403.98s)]
*  So the fight continues, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=408.1s)]
*  and it's just a little microcosm of the larger fight [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=410.06s)]
*  that we're seeing play out throughout the legal system [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=413.14s)]
*  when it comes to the firings [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=416.74s)]
*  that the Trump administration is doing [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=419.66s)]
*  and the legal basis that it has for carrying them out. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=421.62s)]
*  CBS News, Chief White House correspondent, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=424.98s)]
*  Nancy Cordes, always breaking it down, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=426.94s)]
*  making it simple, making me smarter. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=428.62s)]
*  Always good to talk to you. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=430.46000000000004s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Uo37k51qY&t=431.42s)]
