# Gene Hackman, wife found dead in New Mexico home, officials say
**CBS News:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM)
*  We begin this morning with breaking news coming out of New Mexico. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=0.0s)]
*  Actor Gene Hackman has been found dead at his home, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=3.5s)]
*  along with his wife of more than 30 years, Betsy Arakawa. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=6.84s)]
*  Their dog was also found dead. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=11.1s)]
*  Police say no foul play is suspected and no cause of death has been announced. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=13.14s)]
*  The 95-year-old was a two-time Oscar winner and best known for his roles [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=17.580000000000002s)]
*  in the French connection Bonnie and Clyde and Unforgiven, just to name a few. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=21.68s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Jared Hill joins me now in studio 57 with more on this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=26.62s)]
*  Jared, what a shock to see this news, not just of his death, but his wife and their dog. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=31.22s)]
*  What are we learning? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=36.0s)]
*  And that's kind of the strange thing about all of this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=36.9s)]
*  The three of them found dead. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  What we're learning here is that law enforcement were called to the house [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=41.14s)]
*  around 1.45 yesterday afternoon for a welfare check. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=44.1s)]
*  And that's where they found them dead inside the home yesterday afternoon. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  We don't know the circumstances right now, as you were mentioning. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=50.68s)]
*  There's still so many questions about exactly what happened here. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=53.34s)]
*  Authorities, though, have said again that they do not suspect foul play in this [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  situation, but that still remains the question, how did they die? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=60.02s)]
*  Right, that rules out foul play, but [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=63.72s)]
*  it still leaves open the possibility of so many other accidents and other issues. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=65.92s)]
*  This is going to send shockwaves as people learn this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=71.02s)]
*  How is Gene Hackman likely to be remembered? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=73.8s)]
*  One of the things that's interesting is that he was actually asked about this a [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=77.3s)]
*  couple of years ago back in 2009, what would sum up his life? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=80.92s)]
*  He said that he tried. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=84.92s)]
*  And that really does seem to be the story of this man who had this incredibly long [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=86.62s)]
*  career in film, over 70 films, a number of Academy Award nominations, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  as well as wins. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  He's really seen as a bit of a chameleon, being able to adapt to almost any role. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  Seeing himself also as a bit of an everyman, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  saying that he looked like everyday mind worker, not necessarily a movie star. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=104.28s)]
*  And while most of the attention will likely fall on him, because he has, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=109.2s)]
*  as you said, done more than 70 films, has been so prolific, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  his wife was also quite accomplished in what she did. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  That's right, she was a classical pianist as well. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  And so she is someone who also had this robust, not only life, but also career. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=121.76s)]
*  A lot of sorrow, a lot of heartbreak is even becoming out of this news that we're [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=126.72s)]
*  learning here today, especially as we learn more information about the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=130.28s)]
*  circumstances of their death and celebrate both of their lives. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  Right, yeah, just heartbreak coming out of New Mexico for us today. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=136.62s)]
*  Jared, thank you very much. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=139.7s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtAj-2wGAXM&t=140.66s)]
