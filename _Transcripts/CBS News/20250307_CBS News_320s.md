# One week until government shutdown deadline, questions about Medicaid cuts in budget plan
**CBS News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig)
*  Looking at our monitors there at Capitol Hill, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=0.0s)]
*  where the countdown continues. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=2.88s)]
*  Do you see the calendar here behind me? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=4.2s)]
*  The countdown continues for lawmakers [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=6.4s)]
*  to get that government funding bill passed. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  They have one week to push that legislation through, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=10.8s)]
*  or they risk yet another shutdown. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=13.36s)]
*  So all eyes now are on House Speaker Mike Johnson. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=15.18s)]
*  The pressure to keep the lights on bill [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=18.2s)]
*  as several members of the House Freedom Caucus say, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=20.0s)]
*  they aren't ready to hand their votes over quite yet. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=23.32s)]
*  They're holding their cards. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=25.48s)]
*  So Johnson says the text for his resolution bill [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=26.32s)]
*  could come this weekend, and it's going to be a busy one. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=29.28s)]
*  CBS News congressional correspondent, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=31.62s)]
*  Caitlin Huey-Burns joins us now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=33.6s)]
*  So walk us through what's at stake here [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=35.2s)]
*  for Johnson and the Republican party. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=36.86s)]
*  It seems like once again, we find ourselves reporting [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=38.38s)]
*  that this is the 11th hour and more negotiations. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, Reid, I was gonna say, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=44.96s)]
*  if you feel like you've been here before, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=45.88s)]
*  you have, many times. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=47.7s)]
*  We have seen this playbook before. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=49.92s)]
*  We have one week before the government runs out of money. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=51.72s)]
*  Congress knows this. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=55.06s)]
*  Johnson is expected to release text of a bill [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=56.46s)]
*  tonight, tomorrow, through the weekend. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=60.16s)]
*  They're expected to vote on it actually on Tuesday, he said. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=61.5s)]
*  So basically what he's proposing is just continuing [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=65.22s)]
*  current levels of government spending [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=69.06s)]
*  through the end of the fiscal year, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=71.42s)]
*  which is the end of September. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=72.9s)]
*  There are no big cuts to government spending [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=75.06s)]
*  in this package. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=77.02s)]
*  It's just, let's continue at the level [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=77.86s)]
*  set by the Biden administration [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=79.53999999999999s)]
*  through the end of the year. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=81.3s)]
*  And then that way you kind of get it off the table [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=82.62s)]
*  and then you can kind of have these policy fights [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=84.82s)]
*  in the bigger budget where they outline their priorities [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=88.12s)]
*  for the next fiscal year. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=90.84s)]
*  You still have a group of holdouts, however, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=92.94s)]
*  who don't like the levels of government spending [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=95.06s)]
*  that are currently in place and want to see more cuts. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  They met with the White House earlier this week [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=100.56s)]
*  and President Trump essentially told them, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=102.9s)]
*  look, get this out of the way. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=104.76s)]
*  You can have the policy fights, the cuts in spending, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  the Doge cuts incorporated in your other budget [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  that you've proposed, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  but let's not shut down the government. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=113.0s)]
*  We'll see if that holds any weight. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=114.58000000000001s)]
*  Remember the House majority that Republicans have [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=116.44s)]
*  is very fragile. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=119.72s)]
*  They can really only afford to lose one, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  maybe two votes here. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=122.72s)]
*  So they really have to keep their coalition together. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=124.56s)]
*  And there's a big question about whether Democrats [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=126.6s)]
*  would help them in this. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=128.52s)]
*  They're not really politically incentivized to. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=129.88s)]
*  They could put this back in the Republican's court [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=132.76s)]
*  and say, look, you guys are in charge. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=134.96s)]
*  You shut down the government, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=136.4s)]
*  but this spending level is from the previous administration. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=137.82s)]
*  So you may have a couple of Democrats who say, look, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=141.38s)]
*  let's not have any further chaos. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=143.64s)]
*  Let's just continue with this resolution. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=145.4s)]
*  So we'll see, this will likely go to the last minute. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=148.24s)]
*  To the last minute. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=152.12s)]
*  And we do eye those Democrats that you may have mentioned [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=152.94s)]
*  because the really major point of contention for them [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=155.08s)]
*  is this entire GOP plan [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=157.18s)]
*  has the potential for cuts to Medicaid. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  The president has said that won't happen, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  but in the details, right, there's the potentiality there. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=163.6s)]
*  What have you heard from lawmakers [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=166.72s)]
*  about those potential underscore potential cuts to healthcare? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=167.84s)]
*  Yeah, and if this whole process is confusing to you at home, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=172.7s)]
*  to our audience, it's confusing for those who cover it too. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=176.26s)]
*  So don't worry. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=178.73999999999998s)]
*  What we were talking about with the government spending bill, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=179.82s)]
*  that's entirely separate from the big budget plan [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=181.78s)]
*  that Republicans put out a few weeks ago [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=185.22s)]
*  and voted to move forward on a few weeks ago. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=187.38s)]
*  It basically outlines what they wanna spend money on [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=190.0s)]
*  or don't wanna spend money on for the following fiscal year. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=192.85999999999999s)]
*  And in that plan, there was a directive [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=196.62s)]
*  to cut over $800 billion from some programs. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=198.9s)]
*  And to be able to get to that, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=204.82s)]
*  the Congressional Budget Office, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=206.26000000000002s)]
*  which is a nonpartisan group, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=208.18s)]
*  said that to get to that number [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=210.58s)]
*  that they outlined in that budget proposal, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=212.58s)]
*  you're gonna have to make cuts to Medicaid. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=214.98000000000002s)]
*  Otherwise, you just can't get there with basic math. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=217.46s)]
*  Johnson himself has said, we don't wanna cut Medicaid. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=221.02s)]
*  We just wanna root out waste and fraud and abuse. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=224.74s)]
*  But the devil will be in the details here [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=228.42s)]
*  once they get to crafting the actual policy. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=230.14s)]
*  One person's view of waste or anything else [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=233.22s)]
*  could be another person's benefit. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=236.89999999999998s)]
*  So the devil will be in the details [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=239.1s)]
*  whether there are any cuts to benefits [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=241.14s)]
*  that people receive through Medicaid. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=244.06s)]
*  A lot to consider here. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=247.01999999999998s)]
*  We probably won't get to that point [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=248.39999999999998s)]
*  for a little while here, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=250.61999999999998s)]
*  maybe later in the spring, early summer. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=252.61999999999998s)]
*  This is going to be a long process [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=255.1s)]
*  because all those committees have to get together, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=256.64s)]
*  craft the policy to fill out that budget. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=259.08s)]
*  So we're still a long way off, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=261.76s)]
*  but that is something centerpiece here [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  that could really happen. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=265.68s)]
*  Caitlin, what strikes me here [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  is tens of millions of Americans [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=268.28s)]
*  depend on those healthcare services. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=269.91999999999996s)]
*  And it was really fascinating to me to hear recently [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=272.36s)]
*  the president's cheerleader, Steve Bannon, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=275.44s)]
*  saying hands off of Medicaid, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=277.71999999999997s)]
*  that that would politically be a very bad move to make. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=279.88s)]
*  Thank you so much for talking to us about this [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=283.56s)]
*  and breaking it down. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=286.04s)]
*  You had one more thought, I can tell. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=286.88s)]
*  I can tell you have one more thought. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=288.2s)]
*  I was gonna say, I mean, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=290.6s)]
*  you made such an important point there, Reed, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=291.96s)]
*  as you always do. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=293.64s)]
*  And there are a handful of Republicans [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=294.48s)]
*  from districts that have a significant populations [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=296.12s)]
*  that rely on Medicaid [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=300.24s)]
*  who have also raised concerns about this. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=301.44s)]
*  So that will be very interesting to watch. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=304.76s)]
*  Concerns of those town halls that we know you [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=306.84s)]
*  and so many of our peers at CBS News [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=308.9s)]
*  in people's neighborhoods have been covering. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=310.8s)]
*  Now it looks like Republicans are saying, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=313.32s)]
*  let's pull back on the town halls for now. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=314.8s)]
*  Caitlin Huey-Burns, thank you so much. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=316.56s)]
*  Great to talk to you there in our nation's capital. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2FcUIFrig&t=317.92s)]
