# Vance meets with Zelenskyy after demanding NATO allies boost defense spending
**CBS News:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM)
*  It's happening right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=0.0s)]
*  Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=1.32s)]
*  sitting down for a high-stakes meeting [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=4.16s)]
*  with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=5.88s)]
*  So this comes just hours after Mr. Vance delivered [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=8.72s)]
*  a stark message to NATO allies in Munich. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=11.52s)]
*  Europe needs to boost defense spending. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=14.76s)]
*  Take a listen to some of that message. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=17.2s)]
*  Because as President Trump has made abundantly clear, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=19.62s)]
*  he believes that our European friends must play a bigger role [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=22.56s)]
*  in the future of this continent. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=26.68s)]
*  We don't think, you hear this term, burden sharing, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=28.72s)]
*  but we think it's an important part [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=32.12s)]
*  of being in a shared alliance together [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=33.44s)]
*  that the Europeans step up while America focuses on areas [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  of the world that are in great danger. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=39.64s)]
*  So let's go deeper on this. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=42.72s)]
*  CBS News reporter Ananor Skavets joins us from Munich [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=43.84s)]
*  with the very latest. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=46.92s)]
*  So that meeting between Mr. Zelensky [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=47.8s)]
*  and the Vice President happening at this very moment, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=50.16s)]
*  what headlines are we watching to come from? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=53.08s)]
*  It happened just now, and it was a highly anticipated meeting. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=58.68s)]
*  Secretary of State Rubio and Vice President JD Vance [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=63.68s)]
*  are meeting with Zelensky right now. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=68.68s)]
*  And it is really yet unclear what is going to come out of it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=71.44s)]
*  Zelensky said this morning that he doesn't see [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=74.92s)]
*  that the U.S. has a ready-made plan there, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=77.84s)]
*  and the Ukrainian leadership stands very firm [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=80.8s)]
*  with their ideas of peace. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=83.8s)]
*  But the U.S. here, the U.S. delegation, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=87.2s)]
*  is leading a path towards some form of negotiations. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=89.4s)]
*  And we will know by hopefully the next half hour [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=94.4s)]
*  what came out of this meeting. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=99.4s)]
*  Yes, and we can hear the top of the hour bells there behind you. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=102.36s)]
*  I also want to ask you about Secretary of State Marco Rubio [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=106.04s)]
*  also present for that meeting. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=109.36s)]
*  Walk us through Mr. Rubio's presence at that meeting [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=111.08s)]
*  and what you think he has been told [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=114.48s)]
*  by way of the Trump administration and the objectives there. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=116.2s)]
*  It was not clear if Rubio would eventually make it to Munich [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=123.84s)]
*  because he experienced mechanical issues on his plane traveling here, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  and they had to return to Washington [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=133.08s)]
*  and find an alternative way here. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=135.12s)]
*  But now everyone is sitting in the room and having these talks. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=137.4s)]
*  And of course, for Rubio, it's important to bring [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=141.12s)]
*  U.S. foreign policy objectives to the table, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=144.4s)]
*  to the path of finding peace there. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  And it is an important duo for them, showing unity [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=151.0s)]
*  and also the commitment what we had from President Trump [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=156.52s)]
*  not too long ago that the U.S. is now committed to find a way [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=161.52s)]
*  to end this war and bring peace in Ukraine. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=166.44s)]
*  So a lot of leaders at that meeting, at the table, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=169.72s)]
*  what is the what's next element once this meeting wraps? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=173.16s)]
*  So it will be interesting to see if a meeting between Trump and Putin [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=181.96s)]
*  is eventually going to happen, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=186.16s)]
*  like it's the idea to meet in Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  We do not have it confirmed yet when this is going to happen. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=191.88s)]
*  Right now, it is important to note that Ukraine is one of the main points [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=196.0s)]
*  of the agenda here in Munich. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=202.12s)]
*  But of course, Europe is also facing many other challenges [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=204.12s)]
*  like the economic crisis and, of course, also the election [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  coming up here in Germany. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=211.72000000000003s)]
*  So the meeting today also has the feeling of and the notion [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=213.32000000000002s)]
*  of other crises on the continent, which also JD Vance made very clear [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  in his speech that they are insecurities that Europe is facing [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  and that not only America can take responsibility for that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=229.0s)]
*  And we appreciate your reporting from overseas. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=235.8s)]
*  Turning our monitors now to the White House, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=237.44s)]
*  President Donald Trump closely following that meeting and what happens [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=239.36s)]
*  between Vice President JD Vance and the Ukrainian president. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=242.72s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News correspondent Nicole Killian from the White House. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=246.16s)]
*  Nicole, we know Mr. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=249.96s)]
*  Trump faces a lot of questions if he plans to include Ukraine in these talks. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=250.96s)]
*  A lot of people in the European nation have said don't have these talks [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=255.68s)]
*  if Ukraine is not at the table. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=259.16s)]
*  Where does the president stand on that? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, well, in a press availability yesterday, the president here [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=264.76s)]
*  with the White House did try to assure Ukraine and make the statement [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=268.2s)]
*  that Ukraine would still be part of these talks at the same time, though, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=273.64s)]
*  as you know, earlier this week, he has also suggested not only did he have [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=277.48s)]
*  that call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but suggested [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=281.16s)]
*  that the two leaders would eventually meet face to face. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=285.16s)]
*  And that's really kind of what sparked off that wave of concern, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=287.76000000000005s)]
*  particularly from President Zelensky about whether he would be able to be [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=290.64000000000004s)]
*  at the table in terms of negotiating with respect to trying to look for ways [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=295.72s)]
*  to end this conflict. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=300.20000000000005s)]
*  We did, as you mentioned, you know, here a short time ago from a vice president, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  JD Vance, as well, who is currently meeting with the Ukrainian president, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=306.20000000000005s)]
*  also reaffirming that he believes that the president is the ultimate dealmaker. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=310.08000000000004s)]
*  And that eventually they will try to find a resolution to this conflict. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=315.16s)]
*  All right. So let's talk about word of executive orders today. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=319.68s)]
*  We also understand there'll be at least one today. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=323.24s)]
*  Do we have an idea of what that order might be? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, we don't have a concrete preview as of yet as to what it could be. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=330.24s)]
*  But we have been told that we expect at some point this week [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=334.20000000000005s)]
*  that the president would sign an executive order dealing with issues [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=337.6s)]
*  here in the nation's capital in D.C. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=341.04s)]
*  With respect to homelessness and kind of cracking down on the city [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  with respect to encampments. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=346.92s)]
*  So, again, the details of that remains to be seen. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  But that is certainly a potential order he could sign to close out the week. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=352.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, Nicole, we also are very mindful of mass firings [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=356.28000000000003s)]
*  reported among federal employees. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=359.96000000000004s)]
*  What can you tell us about that headline today? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=361.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, we continue to hear, you know, across the federal government [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=367.08000000000004s)]
*  from a variety of agencies about these mass firings, particularly those [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=370.48s)]
*  probationary employees, which are typically employees who not [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=375.44s)]
*  haven't necessarily done anything wrong, but are just maybe new to the job [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=378.76s)]
*  and new to the federal government until they're kind of put on these probation [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=383.04s)]
*  periods. But we do know of some layoffs, for instance, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=386.04s)]
*  at the Department of Veterans Affairs. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=389.96000000000004s)]
*  Of course, earlier this week, we reported about potential firings [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=391.64000000000004s)]
*  at the Department of Education. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=394.72s)]
*  And most recently, we're now learning that this is also potentially hitting [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=396.16s)]
*  the Department of Energy, particularly a unit that manages the nation's [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=400.2s)]
*  nuclear secrets and stockpile, if you will. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=406.36s)]
*  So it is of concern as more of these [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=409.36s)]
*  firings and notices come to light. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=413.4s)]
*  Certainly it's something that many congressional lawmakers [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=415.48s)]
*  to continue to express concern about as well. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=417.84000000000003s)]
*  Bringing some loving care to her reporting there on the White House lawn. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=420.2s)]
*  Nice Valentine's Day scarf, Nicole. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=423.16s)]
*  Nice to have you with us on a Friday. We appreciate it. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzRYjWA9oqM&t=425.64s)]
