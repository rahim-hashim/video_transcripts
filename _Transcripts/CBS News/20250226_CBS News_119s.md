# Supreme Court hearing arguments on "reverse discrimination" case
**CBS News:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l4tozuHRiY)
*  All right, today the Supreme Court will take up the case of a woman who claims she was being [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l4tozuHRiY&t=0.0s)]
*  discriminated against her at her job because she's straight, she's heterosexual. Marlene [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l4tozuHRiY&t=4.16s)]
*  Ames brought the case forward after a situation at work with the Ohio Department of Youth Services. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l4tozuHRiY&t=10.0s)]
*  CBS News legal correspondent Jan Crawford breaks down the case for us. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l4tozuHRiY&t=14.48s)]
*  Well this case came about when Marlene Ames, who was working the Ohio Department of Youth [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l4tozuHRiY&t=19.12s)]
*  Services, decided to put in for promotion at work. But then instead of getting this promotion, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l4tozuHRiY&t=23.52s)]
*  she actually found out she was being demoted. She was getting moved down to a job as a secretary, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l4tozuHRiY&t=28.72s)]
*  and a colleague of hers who was a gay man was getting her job. And then she found out that [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l4tozuHRiY&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  instead of the promotion that she had applied for, that promotion went to a gay woman. So she told [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l4tozuHRiY&t=38.32s)]
*  us when we interviewed her in Akron that she thought something more was going on, and she [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l4tozuHRiY&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  decided to sue. Now her lawyers told us that they knew it was a tough case because Ohio, like 19 [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l4tozuHRiY&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  other states, as well as the District of Columbia, requires people who are suing for discrimination [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l4tozuHRiY&t=54.64s)]
*  under federal civil rights law to prove something more, that they were victims of like a pattern of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l4tozuHRiY&t=59.76s)]
*  historical discrimination. And that's something that's sometimes hard for non-minority to show [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l4tozuHRiY&t=66.4s)]
*  because they weren't typically discriminated against historically. So that's the issue in the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l4tozuHRiY&t=71.92s)]
*  case, and you know how hard could it be for her to show that she was unable to, so therefore she [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l4tozuHRiY&t=77.52s)]
*  couldn't pursue her case in court. Now the justices' hearing arguments, they may be somewhat [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l4tozuHRiY&t=82.8s)]
*  sympathetic to her claims. They're very kind of insistent on that level playing field on some of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l4tozuHRiY&t=88.72s)]
*  these race cases as we've seen in recent terms. The Biden administration also has said they wanted [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l4tozuHRiY&t=94.24s)]
*  a rule that was across the board, across the country, the same, and the Trump administration [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l4tozuHRiY&t=101.44s)]
*  agrees with that, asking the justices to throw out that lower court ruling and give [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l4tozuHRiY&t=106.4s)]
*  Marlene Ames her chance to prove her case in court. Back to you. All right, Jan, thank you very much. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l4tozuHRiY&t=112.4s)]
