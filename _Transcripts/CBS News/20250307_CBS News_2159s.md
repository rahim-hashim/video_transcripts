# Gene Hackman died of heart disease, wife died of hantavirus days earlier, officials say
**CBS News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw)
*  We want to take you now to New Mexico where authorities are sharing new details in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=0.0s)]
*  investigation into the deaths of actor Gene Hackman and his wife. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=3.52s)]
*  ...of Mr. Hackman and Ms. Arakawa and their dog at their residence. I just want to do a short recap [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  and then touch on some new information. As we know, both individuals tested negative [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=14.64s)]
*  for carbon monoxide. City fire conducted tests and deemed seen safe for deputies to conduct [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=21.12s)]
*  their investigation. The preliminary pacemaker interrogation results were released last week [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=26.96s)]
*  and I'll let Dr. Jarrell touch more specifically on those results. The gas company New Mexico, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  they also did an analysis of the residents and they found one minor leak in a single [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=42.4s)]
*  burner on the kitchen stove which was 0.33 percent of room air which was pretty minute and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=48.16s)]
*  insignificant. Since that time, Zena, the deceased dog, has been taken for necropsy [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=54.56s)]
*  at the veterinary diagnostic services and we'll be awaiting those results. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=62.72s)]
*  Let's speak a little bit in reference to the timeline for Betsy Arakawa. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=68.88s)]
*  We know from our investigation that on February 9th, 2025, she picked up Zena from Gruta Veterinary [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  Hospital. There was a procedure that was done with the dog which may explain why the dog was [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=84.48s)]
*  in a crate at the residence. Let's move on to February 11th, 2025. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=91.36s)]
*  Mrs. Arakawa had an email conversation with her massage therapist at about 1121 a.m. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=98.16s)]
*  Moving on into the afternoon, Ms. Arakawa was at the Sprouts Farmers Market between 330 and 415 p.m. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=110.8s)]
*  Ms. Arakawa was seen on surveillance video at the CVS Pharmacy in Santa Fe from 412 to 420 p.m. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  She then stopped at a local pet food store at about 454 p.m. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=131.84s)]
*  Her car was seen on surveillance and the remote control clicker that is assigned to her and her [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  vehicle was used to enter the subdivision to gain access to the gated community at 515 p.m. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=146.08s)]
*  Numerous emails were unopened on her computer on February 11th. There was no additional [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=158.8s)]
*  outgoing communication from her or known activity after February 11th, 2025. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  The cell phone information and the cell phone data is pending. We're working with state police to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=176.24s)]
*  get the information from those phones but our investigation shows that all the last known [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  communication and activity from Ms. Arakawa was on February 11th. I'm going to go ahead and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  turn over the podium to Dr. Gerald. I would ask that everybody refrain from asking questions until [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=195.76000000000002s)]
*  their statements all step up to the podium and then we'll go ahead and field questions from the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=203.2s)]
*  media. Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for being here. I'm Dr. Heather Gerald, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=211.2s)]
*  the Chief Medical Examiner for New Mexico at the Office of the Medical Investigator. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  I'd like to begin by stating that it is unprecedented for the Office of the Medical [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=235.84s)]
*  Investigator to make public statements about death investigations. However, the circumstances [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=242.32s)]
*  surrounding these two deaths require accurate dissemination of important information. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=248.88s)]
*  I've also spoken with the Hackman family prior to this conference who are aware of the autopsy [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=255.6s)]
*  findings and conclusions and are aware of this conference. On Thursday, February 27th, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=261.12s)]
*  I performed an autopsy on Mr. Gene Hackman. Medical Examiner Dr. Daniel Gallego at the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=269.76s)]
*  Office of the Medical Investigator performed a full autopsy on Ms. Betsy Arakawa-Hackman. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=277.04s)]
*  Also on Thursday, February 27th, by report, Ms. Arakawa-Hackman's legal name is Betsy Hackman, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=285.04s)]
*  which is how she will be referred to hereafter. The cause of death for Ms. Betsy Hackman, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  aged 65 years, is hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. The manner of death is natural. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=303.12s)]
*  Autopsy examination and full body postmortem CT demonstrated no findings of trauma internally [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=310.64s)]
*  or externally, with microscopic findings consistent with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=318.08s)]
*  Laboratory testing was positive for hantavirus at a clinical lab, with required confirmation [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=326.96s)]
*  testing positive at scientific laboratories division. The results of the test were positive [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=334.0s)]
*  division. Testing for COVID-19, influenza, and other common respiratory viruses was negative. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=340.08s)]
*  Testing for carbon monoxide was negative. There were no other significant natural disease findings. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=348.88s)]
*  Pills present on scene were thyroid medication, which were being taken as prescribed [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  and is not currently a concern for a contributory cause of death. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=363.52s)]
*  The cause of death for Mr. Gene Hackman, aged 95 years, is hypertensive antherosclerotic [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=370.96s)]
*  cardiovascular disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributory factor. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=378.96s)]
*  Autopsy examination and a full body postmortem CT examination demonstrated no acute findings of [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=386.56s)]
*  internal or external trauma and showed severe heart disease, including multiple surgical [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=395.04s)]
*  procedures involving the heart, evidence of prior heart attacks, and severe changes of the kidneys [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=401.52000000000004s)]
*  due to chronic high blood pressure. Examination of the brain showed advanced Alzheimer's disease, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=407.92s)]
*  as well as blood vessel changes in the brain secondary to chronic high blood pressure. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=415.36s)]
*  Laboratory testing performed at scientific laboratories division was negative for COVID-19, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=421.28s)]
*  influenza, and other common respiratory viruses. Testing for hantavirus was negative. Testing for [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=427.52s)]
*  carbon monoxide was negative. Additionally, there were no autopsy findings concerning for [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=434.96s)]
*  hantavirus infection. I have been asked when death occurred for these individuals. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=442.08s)]
*  There is no reliable scientific method to accurately determine the exact time or date of death. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=448.96s)]
*  Mr. Hackman's initial pacemaker data revealed cardiac activity on February 17th, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=456.08s)]
*  with subsequent pacemaker interrogation demonstrating an abnormal rhythm of atrial fibrillation [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=463.44s)]
*  on February 18th, which was the last record of heart activity. Based on this information, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=470.32s)]
*  it is reasonable to conclude that Mr. Hackman probably died around February 18th. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=478.0s)]
*  Based on the circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that Ms. Hackman passed away first, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=486.48s)]
*  with February 11th being the last time that she was known to be alive. Lastly, clinically, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=494.40000000000003s)]
*  hantavirus infection is characterized by flu-like symptoms consisting of fever, muscle aches, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=502.24s)]
*  cough, sometimes vomiting and diarrhea that can progress to shortness of breath and cardiac or [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=509.84000000000003s)]
*  heart failure and lung failure. This occurs after a one to eight week exposure to excrement from a [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=517.36s)]
*  primarily particular mouse species that carries hantavirus. The mortality of hantavirus, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=527.84s)]
*  excuse me, the mortality rate of the hantavirus strain in the southwest is about 38 to 50 percent. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=538.64s)]
*  The hantavirus strains in the United States are not transmissible from person to person, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=548.5600000000001s)]
*  and so this is an appropriate time to segue to Dr. Erin Phipps, the state public health [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=554.96s)]
*  veterinarian with the New Mexico Department of Health. But before I do so, I'd like to kindly ask [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=561.12s)]
*  for everyone to please respect the privacy that Mr. Gene Hackman, Ms. Betsy Hackman, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=568.0s)]
*  and their family and friends deserve. Thank you. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=574.88s)]
*  Thank you, Dr. Jarrell. I will now provide additional information about hantiviruses in New [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=577.52s)]
*  Mexico. There are many different types of hantiviruses found worldwide. These viruses are [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=588.64s)]
*  zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted from animals to humans. Hantiviruses are carried by [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=595.28s)]
*  rodents. The hantavirus found in New Mexico, the Sinombre virus, is found throughout the state, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=601.2s)]
*  primarily in deer mice, but in other rodents as well. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is a rare [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=607.84s)]
*  disease caused by hantiviruses, but a small number of human infections are found every year in New [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=614.96s)]
*  Mexico. Over the past five years, New Mexico has confirmed between one and seven hantavirus infections [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=621.44s)]
*  in humans each year. Through the end of 2024, we have identified 136 infections over the past [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=629.68s)]
*  50 years in New Mexico residents, five of these in Santa Fe County. This is a serious disease. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=637.92s)]
*  42% of these infections here in New Mexico were fatal. Most transmission occurs around the [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=645.92s)]
*  patient's residence or workplace, and the New Mexico Department of Health typically conducts [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=653.92s)]
*  an environmental investigation at the residence of all hantavirus cases in our jurisdiction. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=658.88s)]
*  This can help identify specific areas that may pose higher risk, providing insight into where [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=665.12s)]
*  transmission may have occurred and how to prevent future infections. On March 5th, the New Mexico [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=671.2s)]
*  Department of Health staff conducted a risk assessment of the property, including the main [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=678.72s)]
*  residence as well as other structures on the property. This was critically important to [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=683.52s)]
*  address concerns about health risk to first responders, as well as to inform any prevention [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=688.48s)]
*  measures needed to protect the family and other individuals entering the property in the future. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=694.0799999999999s)]
*  We assessed the risk of exposure in the primary residence as low, similar to other well-maintained [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=700.72s)]
*  houses in New Mexico. We did identify signs of rodent entry in other structures on the property [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=706.72s)]
*  and provided information and resources about reducing the risk of hantavirus transmission [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=714.08s)]
*  related to those areas. Hantavirus can be transmitted to people through rodent urine [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=719.44s)]
*  droppings or saliva, so it is important to take special steps when cleaning up after rodents. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=726.0s)]
*  Avoiding contact with or breathing in aerosolized rodent urine or feces, especially in a poorly [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=732.0s)]
*  ventilated area, is key. Detailed guidance can be found on the New Mexico Department of Health [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=738.9599999999999s)]
*  and the CDC websites, but I will provide a very brief summary now. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=745.04s)]
*  It is important to use gloves and a well-fitting N95 mask when around or cleaning rodent-infested [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=752.16s)]
*  areas and to open any windows or doors for at least 30 minutes beforehand to increase ventilation. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=758.56s)]
*  Spray the area thoroughly with a 10% bleach solution or a commercial disinfectant. Let it [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=765.8399999999999s)]
*  sit for five minutes. Next, clean the area with paper towels, then throw them away in a covered [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=772.0799999999999s)]
*  garbage can that is regularly emptied. Before removing gloves, wash your gloved hands with soap [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=778.3199999999999s)]
*  and water or with a disinfectant, and then after removing gloves, wash your hands again with soap [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=785.2s)]
*  and water. It is important to never sweep up or vacuum mouse droppings since this can spread [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=791.6800000000001s)]
*  particles up into the air. Since hantavirus is found throughout New Mexico, awareness of these [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=798.96s)]
*  risks and how to reduce them is important for all New Mexicans. The New Mexico Department of Health [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=806.08s)]
*  extends our deepest condolences to the families and friends during this difficult time. Thank you. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=812.08s)]
*  Thank you. I think that'll conclude the statements for today. We will go ahead and [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=821.9200000000001s)]
*  take questions. I ask that there be one question per agency and please state who you're directing [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=826.64s)]
*  the question to as there's several individuals here at this conference. Sir. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=834.48s)]
*  Does this mean Gene Hackman was likely home with his deceased wife for a week before he passed away himself? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=842.08s)]
*  Yes, I would assume that that is the case. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=849.2s)]
*  Do you want to give his Alzheimer's status that Mr. Hackman was able to live on his own and [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=852.08s)]
*  survive for those seven days? I think that's more a question maybe for Dr. Jarrell. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=857.12s)]
*  Just for just to repeat so that everyone could hear the question was do we believe that Mr. Hackman [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=863.84s)]
*  was able to live on his own and survive? The answer to that question is that Mr. Hackman [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=873.44s)]
*  showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer's disease. I'm not aware of what his normal daily functioning [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=880.88s)]
*  capability was. He was in a very poor state of health. He had significant heart disease [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=888.48s)]
*  and I think ultimately that is what resulted in his death. I was able to [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=896.0s)]
*  look at fluid to determine if he was dehydrated and I did not see evidence of dehydration. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=905.2s)]
*  I did see evidence of very poor kidney function and I think he died as a result of his [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=913.52s)]
*  heart disease and with Alzheimer's being that contributing factor. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=922.32s)]
*  The question was what about starvation? So there was no food in his stomach which means he had [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=930.0s)]
*  not eaten recently but he had also no evidence of dehydration. Based on your understanding of the [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=940.24s)]
*  progression of the Alzheimer's do you believe that he was possibly not aware that his wife had died [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=948.8s)]
*  or didn't know what to do in that situation? It's difficult to answer. The question was was he aware [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=955.52s)]
*  that Ms. Hackman had died and I think that question is difficult to answer but I can tell you that he [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=962.48s)]
*  was in an advanced state of Alzheimer's and it's quite possible that he was not aware that she was [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=968.0s)]
*  deceased. This is for the sheriff. Considering the circumstances under which Mr. Hackman was found in [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=973.44s)]
*  the mud room with his walking cane and sunglasses by him do you think there is a possibility that he [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=979.2s)]
*  was trying to get help for his wife? That's hard to answer. Again it's hard to get into the frame [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=985.68s)]
*  of mind of what was happening at the time and I don't know if we'll ever have the answer to that [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=991.6s)]
*  question whether he was going to go for help or he wasn't. Are there any other big questions [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=995.76s)]
*  that you're trying to answer? I mean does this answer the biggest questions you had about their [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1001.28s)]
*  death in this case? Is there anything else that you're really seeking? Yeah so the question is [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1005.28s)]
*  is there any other big questions that are left? You know I think a lot of questions were answered [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1009.36s)]
*  here today. I think there was you know Dr. Durrell went over the cause of death and I think a lot of [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1013.92s)]
*  those questions are answered. I think the timeline that we've been given as far as the pacemaker [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1020.88s)]
*  results and the history and evidence that we found as far as the timeline of Ms. Arakawa, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1026.0s)]
*  I think a lot of the questions have been answered. We are waiting on the cell phones but I would, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1032.0s)]
*  very unlikely that the cell phones are going to show anything else. Another question? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1038.32s)]
*  Are there any signs of like what have you learned about Mr. Hackman's communication after February 11th? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1042.56s)]
*  Did you talk to any friends of his who had spoken with him during that week long period [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1047.36s)]
*  or know anything about what he was doing? So the question is is whether there was any communication [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1052.08s)]
*  from Mr. Hackman or activity and no at this point no I don't know if he used cell phones or [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1056.56s)]
*  technology or emails. There's no indication of that so right now there is no activity from Mr. Hackman. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1065.6799999999998s)]
*  Sheriff do you know if his pacemaker was connected to some sort of monitoring service? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1071.44s)]
*  The question was was his pacemaker connected to a monitoring service. The answer to that is that [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1083.1200000000001s)]
*  the his physician, one of his physicians had contacted me and and told me that they could see [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1092.4s)]
*  the data from the 17th but that to really get the most information from that would come from [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1099.12s)]
*  the interrogation of the pacemaker and that's as much as I can answer not being a cardiologist. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1107.12s)]
*  I can't answer that question I'm sorry. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1123.36s)]
*  Was there any footage that came from the body cam from the house? I'm sorry what was there was there [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1130.08s)]
*  any footage or anything that you can see from like a body cam footage from the house? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1138.1599999999999s)]
*  Are you talking about the body cams that the the investigator the the responding [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1145.04s)]
*  personnel were wearing? Is there any video? No so there so there was no outside surveillance or [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1148.7199999999998s)]
*  interior surveillance that we are aware of in the residence so there was nothing to show [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1154.3999999999999s)]
*  the activity inside or outside the residence and not at this time no. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1158.32s)]
*  Dr. Jarrell you mentioned that one of the symptoms of hantavirus is shortness of breath. We've [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1162.96s)]
*  learned before that Betsy Hackman was laying on the floor when she was down. What kind of medical [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1169.6s)]
*  episode would she have had to cause her to fall and then not be able to ask for help? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1174.8s)]
*  The question was regarding shortness of breath with hantavirus and what kind of medical episode [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1183.76s)]
*  would we expect from somebody found on the floor? And I think to be able to answer that question [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1190.08s)]
*  fairly I can go back to hantavirus infection which initiates with what's called a prodromal phase [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1195.6s)]
*  that's initially flu-like symptoms where a person has fever and muscle aches that they don't feel [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1206.08s)]
*  well after of course being exposed to rodent excrement and that phase can last roughly three [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1212.16s)]
*  to six days and then they can transition to that pulmonary phase where they have fluid in their [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1223.2s)]
*  lungs and around their lungs and at that point a person can die very quickly within 24 to 48 hours [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1230.64s)]
*  roughly speaking without medical treatment. It's not uncommon to find someone down on the [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1238.48s)]
*  floor as part of a terminal collapse so to speak and that may very well have been what happened to [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1244.64s)]
*  Ms. Hackman. So you're estimating her time of death on the 11th or is it possible that she collapsed [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1251.6s)]
*  and was alive for a couple of days? It's hard to say. I don't think she was on the floor alive [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1257.2s)]
*  for a couple of days. I think that she went through that time period and I don't know when [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1264.0s)]
*  she began to feel ill and those are just things that I don't know that I'm ever going to have the [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1271.12s)]
*  answers to but I think and going back to that initial time period roughly three to six days [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1276.32s)]
*  of feeling ill and then succumbing pretty quickly after fluid begins to build up in the lungs. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1283.92s)]
*  The dogs die from dehydration? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1294.0s)]
*  I don't think we know the answer to that however given the timelines presented it is a possibility. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1301.84s)]
*  Dogs do not get sick from hantavirus. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1312.48s)]
*  The question was if we knew on Betsy's visit to the pharmacy if there was some medication or if she [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1324.96s)]
*  consulted with a pharmacist. We don't have that information and I'm not sure that we can get that [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1330.4s)]
*  information due to HIPAA laws but we don't have that information right now. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1334.56s)]
*  Sir. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1340.0s)]
*  At this point there's no indication that there was a caretaker at the home. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1341.6s)]
*  You know we we can analyze the video a little more and but it's it's kind of a [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1355.04s)]
*  little bit of a surprise to me that there was a caretaker at the home. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1360.24s)]
*  You know we we can analyze the video a little more and but it's it's going to be hard to tell. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1364.96s)]
*  She was walking around, she was shopping, she was visiting stores but my detectives didn't indicate [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1372.96s)]
*  that there was any problem with her or struggle of her getting around so and I believe she had a mask [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1379.12s)]
*  on also so I'll have to confirm that but yeah that there wasn't any indication of that. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1384.8s)]
*  Sasha. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1390.48s)]
*  What was the last time you guys dealt with a hantavirus case in Santa Fe County or responded to one? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1394.08s)]
*  Yeah the question was last time the City of Santa Fe or the county dealt with a hantavirus case. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1402.72s)]
*  I think we're gonna have to look into that. I'll get back to you. I would have to do some data before [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1406.6399999999999s)]
*  we pull that. Have you had any communication with the CDC? Is there a concern about a bigger public [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1410.8799999999999s)]
*  health issue here when it comes to hantavirus? The CDC is aware of this case. Hantavirus is a [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1414.8799999999999s)]
*  notifiable condition nationally. All hantavirus cases are notified to them. This is not an unusual [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1422.24s)]
*  case. We get cases every year unfortunately so we're not seeing any indications of any [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1430.96s)]
*  abnormal or unusual patterns. Dr. Darrell? We'll go ahead and take two more questions and then [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1436.72s)]
*  we'll wrap this up. Is there anybody that hasn't asked a question yet? Sir. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1444.0s)]
*  Again we're going through some of the communications and I think the cell phones may [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1452.4s)]
*  have some indications of that prior to the 11th but as of this moment I don't have any [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1458.88s)]
*  information that she was indicating that she was feeling ill during any communication. One more question. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1465.68s)]
*  Since there's no sense that this is criminal in nature, are you closing this investigation? Are you still going to be releasing body camera footage from the deputies that entered the house? What happens next? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1471.36s)]
*  We're not going to be releasing any information until we close the loopholes of the cell phones, until we finish out the necropsy results of the canine and other loose ends that we need to tie up. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1501.84s)]
*  I think we're pretty close to the timeline and with the information that Dr. Darrell provided. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1511.84s)]
*  One question on the heart disease. Is it fair to describe this as a heart attack or is that not an accurate time for a heart disease that he suffered? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1518.24s)]
*  Heart failure? I know can't really describe it. Please just stop terminology. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1549.1200000000001s)]
*  Is it heart failure? I know can't really describe it. Please just stop terminology. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1553.12s)]
*  Heart failure and congestion of the liver. I did not see that in his case but he had very poor heart or very extensive heart disease and so he would have been predisposed to abnormal heart rhythms and hence he had a pacemaker as well. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1584.0s)]
*  Thank you everybody. That will conclude the press conference for today. Thank you everybody. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1602.0s)]
*  We have been listening to authorities in New Mexico give an update on actor Gene Hackman's death as well as the death of his wife. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1606.88s)]
*  Officials provided a timeline leading up to their deaths and according to the state's chief medical investigator, autopsies were conducted February 27th. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1614.88s)]
*  One day after they were found dead in their Santa Fe home and they found that Betsy Hackman Arakawa died. She's 65 years old from Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome and it is believed that Gene Hackman who is 95 died almost a week later. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1625.7600000000002s)]
*  Possibly a number of factors including heart disease that was exacerbated by Alzheimer's. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1644.64s)]
*  We have right now CBS News correspondent Carter Evans who was at that press conference and asked officials a question there. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1648.64s)]
*  A lot of details on Hantavirus because a lot of people probably aren't familiar with that. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1654.64s)]
*  Carter, you also asked a question about Hackman's possible last actions based on what he was seeing. What are your takeaways from what we just heard? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1659.64s)]
*  Well, you know, Hantavirus is spread by rodents through rodent droppings or urine as the doctor said and they did determine through the autopsy that Mrs. Hackman, Mrs. Arakawa Hackman was infected with the Hantavirus. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1669.5200000000002s)]
*  Now, they were talking about this timeline where she had been communicating, she had been out running errands on February 11th and all of a sudden in the afternoon all of that communication stopped. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1682.5200000000002s)]
*  So right now they believe that she passed away from Hantavirus or complications due to it sometime around February 11th. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1692.4s)]
*  Now we know that Gene Hackman's pacemaker was working through the 17th and in fact it sent back some data indicating AFib on the 18th. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1702.4s)]
*  So they're now saying that Gene Hackman could have been alive for up to a week after his wife died. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1711.4s)]
*  I guess the question is what was happening during that time and unfortunately they're probably never going to know exactly what happened because was he going to get help for his wife? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1719.2800000000002s)]
*  Is that why he was by the door there in the mud room and he collapsed and he was there on the floor for a week or was he in such advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease that he really wasn't aware of what was going on and he succumbed to his heart disease a week later because he wasn't being taken care of? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1729.2800000000002s)]
*  I think that is a question right now that still remains and that may never be answered. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1748.16s)]
*  Yeah, no evidence of a caretaker being in the home. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1751.16s)]
*  Everybody there was asked whether there was any evidence of whether he would be able to live on his own and survive and as you said Carter it appears because they don't know what his normal daily functioning is we may never know the answer to that question. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1754.16s)]
*  But hantavirus, very rare, officials there said 38 to 50 percent mortality rate not transferable from person to person. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1767.0400000000002s)]
*  Any other top lines that you got from that press conference about what we should know about hantavirus? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1776.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you know hantavirus transmissible from rodents to humans through feces, saliva or urine. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1783.0400000000002s)]
*  You know we've heard about this happening before in other states. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1789.0400000000002s)]
*  It seems to be a rare occurrence. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1793.92s)]
*  Here they've had hantavirus infections in New Mexico before. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1795.92s)]
*  They say there's about a 42 percent mortality rate for people who are infected with the virus here. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1798.92s)]
*  So it is a significant virus and it can be deadly as we've seen here. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1804.92s)]
*  And Carter one question that I have which again I don't know if we'll ever know the answer to. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1809.92s)]
*  The chief medical investigator was asked what's his pacemaker, Hackman's pacemaker connected to a monitoring service. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1815.92s)]
*  And she had responded that one of his physicians said they could see data from February 17th. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1822.8000000000002s)]
*  They're placing his time of death around February 18th again not found until February 26th. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1826.8000000000002s)]
*  But I guess my question is that nobody was aware that his pacemaker had stopped when it did. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1833.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think that that's the conclusion there. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1842.8000000000002s)]
*  Nobody was aware that his pacemaker had stopped or at least on the 17th or 18th. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1843.8000000000002s)]
*  But it does seem like doctors did have some of that information available to what degree they were monitoring it on a day to day basis. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1849.68s)]
*  If there was some sort of alarm that went off when there was an issue, that's not really clear right now. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1856.68s)]
*  Right now that is just being used as an indicator of how long he survived past the point where his wife passed away. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1861.68s)]
*  Carter is there is there anything next to follow up on? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1871.68s)]
*  Are there any next steps or is sort of the gist from this press conference and your understanding of the situation that this is a really horrible? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1875.5600000000002s)]
*  I'd hate to use the word coincidence, but they both appear to have died from natural causes that there's maybe nothing left to investigate. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1883.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, well they say the investigation is still open, but that seems to be a technicality. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1891.5600000000002s)]
*  They still want to be able to get into the two phones that were found so they can confirm communications, maybe round out the story a little bit more. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1895.5600000000002s)]
*  Perhaps see if Gene Hackman tried to access his phone, tried to call anyone. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1903.44s)]
*  Maybe they'll be able to determine something from that and get a little more information. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1908.44s)]
*  But it appears now that they've got the cause of death pretty much nailed down that the investigation is coming to a close right now. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1912.44s)]
*  Carter Evans, thank you so much. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1919.44s)]
*  Dr. Owais Durrani joins me now. He is an emergency medicine physician. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1921.44s)]
*  Doctor, thanks for being here. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1925.44s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1928.44s)]
*  So some people may not be aware of hantavirus, but we heard from officials there that though it is rare, they do have several cases in New Mexico a year. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1930.3200000000002s)]
*  This is a mandatory reported illness that if, for example, the New Mexico Department of Health sees one of these cases, they alert the CDC, which happened here. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1938.3200000000002s)]
*  What are your big top lines for us to know about this? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1946.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so it is very regional. It's kind of located in the southwest United States. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1949.3200000000002s)]
*  It's usually something that's spread by rodents. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1955.2s)]
*  And so usually folks that go out camping are very aware of this because they don't want to get bitten by rodents. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1957.2s)]
*  And usually it's a bite or feces or saliva of a rodent that infects you. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1963.2s)]
*  There's various stages of this. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1969.2s)]
*  And so initially it presents kind of like a viral syndrome. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1971.2s)]
*  So, you know, body aches, fatigue, fevers, that kind of thing. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1973.2s)]
*  And then when it becomes very dangerous is when it kind of turns into this pulmonary syndrome where you have difficulty breathing, you get fluid on your lungs. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1976.2s)]
*  And that's unfortunately when people pass away from this virus. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1984.0800000000002s)]
*  So it's very regional, but obviously something very dangerous. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1987.0800000000002s)]
*  How would somebody come into contact with rodent excrement or how would somebody contract this? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1990.0800000000002s)]
*  How does it pass from rodent to person? [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=1998.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so some type of contact. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2000.0800000000002s)]
*  Usually the most kind of common cases that we hear about is you were either hiking and you went into a bush and kind of came into contact and maybe got bitten or you're at a camping site. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2003.0800000000002s)]
*  And your food or some other substance got contaminated and you got into those substances. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2012.96s)]
*  So it has to be some type of direct contact. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2019.96s)]
*  Of course, you know, rodents can get into homes and there have been reports of that as well. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2021.96s)]
*  And so it requires some type of direct contact. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2026.96s)]
*  And then unfortunately that's where it kind of takes off from there with a human getting infected. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2028.96s)]
*  The mortality rate to me, doctor, and I'm not a professional, so please correct me if I'm wrong. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2032.96s)]
*  The mortality rate seems high to me. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2038.96s)]
*  Is there a treatment? Is there a cure for hantavirus? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2040.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so unfortunately no cure. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2042.8400000000001s)]
*  It is a high mortality rate once it does progress, especially to that pulmonary syndrome where your lungs kind of fill up with fluid and whatnot. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2046.8400000000001s)]
*  The only treatment we have is supportive care. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2053.84s)]
*  And so that basically means if someone is having respiratory distress, putting them on, you know, oxygen, maybe putting them on mechanical ventilation. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2056.84s)]
*  If they're having, you can have kidney failure with this, giving them fluids, maybe putting them on dialysis, those kinds of things. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2063.84s)]
*  But there's no medication or no potion for this antidote for this, unfortunately. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2069.7200000000003s)]
*  So given what we heard about Gene Hackman's health, I'm just going to rattle off a little bit of what investigators said. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2075.7200000000003s)]
*  95 years old, evidence of heart disease, advanced Alzheimer's disease, no internal external trauma, evidence of previous heart attacks, changes in kidneys due to high blood pressure, negative for hantavirus, and carbon monoxide. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2082.7200000000003s)]
*  What are your takeaways from what we know about Hackman's health and the fact that he passed away about a week after his wife? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2096.6s)]
*  Yeah, so, you know, from kind of this report that we heard, he did have some memory issues as well. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2103.6s)]
*  And so obviously anytime you have cardiac issues and whatnot, you have to be on a very strict regimen of medications and missing even a few doses of those medications or not having those on time can unfortunately be deadly. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2110.6s)]
*  And in his case, unfortunately, maybe, you know, he got to a point where he needed immediate medical care and he wasn't able to, you know, seek that immediate medical care because his wife had passed away. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2123.48s)]
*  And so obviously we're speculating right now, but anytime you have many medical conditions, you have advanced age and you have some degree of memory issues, that's why we need caretakers. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2134.48s)]
*  That's why we need family to be checking in on patients. And unfortunately, when that caretaker is taken away from that picture, bad outcomes happen. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2145.36s)]
*  Well, Dr. Oisturani, we appreciate your expertise. Thank you for your time. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2153.36s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnkfErAHgw&t=2157.36s)]
