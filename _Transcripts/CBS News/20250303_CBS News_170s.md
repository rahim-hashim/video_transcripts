# Hegseth pauses cyber offensive against Russia
**CBS News:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA)
*  U.S. foreign policy is rapidly shifting under President Trump, and some are concerned. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump's former National Security Advisor, Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, recently [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=5.68s)]
*  said President Trump was being played by Russian leader Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=10.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, a number of U.S. officials told CBS News that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=15.44s)]
*  issued a directive to U.S. Cyber Command to stop planning against Russia. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  The reason behind the pause, just how long it's going to last, all of that is still unclear right now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=26.64s)]
*  National Security Institute Senior Fellow Lester Munson joins us now to discuss the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=32.24s)]
*  latest changes in American foreign policy. Lester, thank you so much for being with us today. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=36.32s)]
*  What do you know about that pause in cyber defensive, cyber offensive rather, against Russia? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=41.52s)]
*  Well, it's been reported that the U.S. Defense Department has indeed paused at least some [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=48.08s)]
*  cyber operations with respect to Russia. This has been rumored for a few days now, and if it's part [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=54.800000000000004s)]
*  of a package of steps the administration is taking to incentivize Russia into ceasefire negotiations [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=61.36s)]
*  in Ukraine, then I think there's some rational basis for all of this. The devil's in the details, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=69.36s)]
*  of course. These activities are generally classified at a very high level, so I don't [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=75.84s)]
*  think we're ever really going to be able to speak about those details on television or anything, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=80.4s)]
*  but this is clearly part of a package of carrots and sticks that the Trump administration is [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=85.44000000000001s)]
*  rolling out to advance peace negotiations for Ukraine. But how do you think this would [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  ultimately affect the future of NATO? Well, this particular step I don't know. I think overall the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  question of a peace arrangement in Ukraine is definitely testing some of the traditional [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=105.44s)]
*  assumptions about NATO. One of the assumptions about NATO that we don't really speak about [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=113.44s)]
*  openly very often is that the U.S. basically provides a defense umbrella for most of Europe [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=118.96s)]
*  through NATO. That is now coming into question because President Trump has said [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=126.24s)]
*  Europe needs to start paying for its own defense. It needs to start providing more of the umbrella, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=131.68s)]
*  in other words. So is that good or bad for NATO? To be frank, I kind of come down on the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=135.84s)]
*  that's actually good for NATO side of this question, but a lot of people, good people who [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=142.56s)]
*  are trying to understand this and kind of see where things are going are a little bit worried [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  about it and think it might be coming down on bad for NATO. So there's definitely changes afoot [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=152.4s)]
*  overall in the relationship between the U.S. and Europe and NATO is going to be tested here [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  as we go forward on peace talks for Ukraine. Okay, Lester Munson, thank you so much for your [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=163.44s)]
*  time today. Thank you. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K619V02giaA&t=168.96s)]
