# Biden speaks with Netanyahu as ceasefire talks continue
**CBS News:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8)
*  President Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the weekend to discuss [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=0.0s)]
*  the ongoing negotiations over a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=5.04s)]
*  This comes as the talks, mediated by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar, are continuing in Doha. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=10.4s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Remy Nascencio has more on this. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=16.32s)]
*  And just this morning, CBS News learned from an official close to those talks that they [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=22.36s)]
*  are now waiting for Hamas' approval of a final draft that had been submitted to both Hamas as well as Israel. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=26.04s)]
*  That source said if it is approved, then that would be considered a breakthrough. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=34.04s)]
*  Then negotiators in Doha could go into closing talks. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=39.239999999999995s)]
*  That source also said the parties are not there yet, but there is potential for real progress. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=43.16s)]
*  And this comes after calls, after meetings and movements involving high-profile figures over the weekend. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  Netanyahu spoke with President Biden by phone yesterday, even though Biden we know is very much [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=55.48s)]
*  in the rearview mirror with Donald Trump taking over exactly a week from today. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=60.599999999999994s)]
*  And this past weekend, Trump's own Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Netanyahu, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=65.88s)]
*  then flew back to Qatar to carry on with those talks. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=71.64s)]
*  Netanyahu also approved the head of the Mossad, Israel's spy agency, to travel to Doha to join. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=74.52s)]
*  And that further implies that a deal could be close. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=80.19999999999999s)]
*  Our CBS News team in Gaza also reports that Hamas, which is still getting targeted each and every day [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=84.44s)]
*  by Israel's military, claims that it responded to all issues in order to make progress. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  The major hurdles, we understand, still are the condition of those hostages who's alive and who's [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=96.44s)]
*  dead Israel wants to know. And Hamas' demand that Israel totally withdraw from Gaza, which so far [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=101.72s)]
*  has been a red line, which many expect will not change. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=107.96s)]
*  But there is hope. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, also outgoing, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=112.6s)]
*  told the local Israeli news channel here, we are very close to a deal. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=117.55999999999999s)]
*  It can be reached by January 20th. And we have got seven days. Back to you. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=121.32s)]
*  All right, Remy Innocentio, thank you for that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-F-7wWFSY8&t=126.91999999999999s)]
