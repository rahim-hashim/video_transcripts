# What to know about Colombia's decision to accept migrant flights after Trump tariff threat
**CBS News:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y)
*  A potential trade war between Colombia and the United States is averted over the weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump had threatened to impose tariffs against Colombia after that country originally [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=6.38s)]
*  refused to accept flights carrying deported migrants. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=10.44s)]
*  Colombia has now reversed course and is accepting those flights. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=13.76s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News immigration and politics reporter Camilo Montoya Galvaz for [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=16.56s)]
*  more on this. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=21.16s)]
*  So just so people understand Camilo, why did Colombia initially refuse to accept these [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=22.66s)]
*  flights given that they had accepted some 500 flights over the last couple of years? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=27.8s)]
*  Well, Vlad, this incident really underscores and illustrates how aggressively the Trump [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=33.64s)]
*  administration is willing to really go to implement its crackdown on illegal immigration [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=39.28s)]
*  and the immigration system across the board. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=45.88s)]
*  We do know, obviously, to level set here that Colombia has been accepting U.S. deportations [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=48.84s)]
*  for years, including under the Biden administration. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=53.82s)]
*  However, they were usually conducted on civilian aircraft. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  And the Trump administration over the weekend, Vlad, tried to carry out two deportation flights [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=60.36s)]
*  to Colombia, to Bogota, the capital, on two military aircraft. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=65.48s)]
*  That is part of that broader effort by the Trump administration to increase the role [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=70.24s)]
*  that the military plays in border and immigration enforcement. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=74.68s)]
*  In addition to deploying troops, the administration is also using military aircraft like C-17s [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  to deport people to countries like Guatemala. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=83.52s)]
*  They tried to do the same with Colombia, but the president of Colombia, Gustavo Petrovlar, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=86.30000000000001s)]
*  said that he objected to the use of military planes because he believed that, signaled [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=90.34s)]
*  that migrants were being treated as criminals and delinquents and that that was not a dignified [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=95.18s)]
*  and humane process for migrants. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=100.16000000000001s)]
*  So initially, after accepting the flights, the government of Colombia rejected them. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=102.46000000000001s)]
*  But obviously, following that, the president here, President Trump, threatened punishing [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=106.58000000000001s)]
*  the swift sanctions on Colombia, including tariffs and visa limits. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=112.46s)]
*  And after that, obviously, the Colombian government now has fully agreed to accept deportation [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=116.14s)]
*  flights, we are told, including a military aircraft. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=121.42s)]
*  So this really does illustrate how much of a focus this issue will be for the Trump [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=124.61999999999999s)]
*  administration on the foreign affairs stage. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=130.06s)]
*  Vlad. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=132.18s)]
*  Camilo, we're also learning that the administration is developing an asylum agreement with El [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=133.18s)]
*  Salvador that would allow the U.S. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=136.98s)]
*  to deport migrants to the country, even if they're not from there. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=138.62s)]
*  Tell me about that. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=141.82s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=142.82s)]
*  We have exclusively learned here at CBS News, Vlad, that the Trump administration is working [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=143.82s)]
*  on developing an asylum agreement with the country of El Salvador to be able to send [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=148.94s)]
*  non-Salvadorian migrants to that small Central American country. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=154.06s)]
*  This would be called a safe third country asylum agreement, and it would empower U.S. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=158.29999999999998s)]
*  immigration officials, including at the U.S.-Mexico border, Vlad, to essentially block people from [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=163.26s)]
*  seeking asylum in the U.S. and instead instruct them to seek asylum in El Salvador, which [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=169.29999999999998s)]
*  would be designated a safe third country for asylum seekers. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=174.29999999999998s)]
*  Importantly, we are told that one plan under internal consideration, Vlad, would allow [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=178.45999999999998s)]
*  the U.S. to deport Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members, suspected gang members from [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=184.82s)]
*  Venezuela to El Salvador, and have that country incarcerate them there in that Central American [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=190.01999999999998s)]
*  country. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=195.66s)]
*  This would be a pretty significant development, as Venezuela right now, Vlad, rejects U.S. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=196.66s)]
*  deportation. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=202.29999999999998s)]
*  So it would be a way for the Trump administration to address that migrant population that right [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=203.3s)]
*  now cannot be deported to their own home country. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=207.57999999999998s)]
*  But obviously, this could face legal challenges from pro-immigrant advocates. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=210.66s)]
*  Camilo, we know that there have been yesterday alone some nearly 1,000 arrests of migrants, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=214.57999999999998s)]
*  in the United States, which has significantly shut up from previous days. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=224.7s)]
*  The president and the administration say that they're going after violent criminals, people [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=231.57999999999998s)]
*  who have broken the law excessively. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=235.1s)]
*  How does our reporting bear witness to that? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=238.38s)]
*  Are they accurate in suggesting that you're not seeing people who are law-abiding, moms [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=241.44s)]
*  and children? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=247.66s)]
*  Or are they really what the administration is saying, which is these violent criminal [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=249.54s)]
*  offenders, at least initially? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=253.85999999999999s)]
*  Well, Vlad, the Trump administration is laying the groundwork to oversee what the president [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=255.5s)]
*  has promised will be the largest deportation effort in American history. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=261.58s)]
*  But to answer your question directly, it is really important to underscore that immigration [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=265.62s)]
*  and customs enforcement right now is still mainly targeting undocumented immigrants who [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=270.62s)]
*  also have criminal convictions or charges and who are deemed to pose a threat to public [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=276.04s)]
*  safety or national security, just like under the Biden administration. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=280.88s)]
*  However, the big change now, Vlad, is that the ICE agents right now who are going on [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=284.56s)]
*  these operations are no longer prohibited from arresting other non-criminal migrants [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=289.40000000000003s)]
*  who are in the country illegally, but who lack criminal records during these operations. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=295.16s)]
*  So, for example, if they target an undocumented immigrant who has a criminal record, but they [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  also find that that person is living with somebody who is also in the country illegally, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=303.8s)]
*  but who is not a criminal, that second person can also be arrested now. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=308.12s)]
*  That is a seismic shift from Biden administration policy, Vlad, that generally limited immigration [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=312.0s)]
*  enforcement to serious criminals and national security threats. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=317.92s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=322.36s)]
*  All right, Camilo Montoya-Gavez for us this morning. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=323.36s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=325.0s)]
*  Thanks a lot. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSQWwn6i5Y&t=326.0s)]
