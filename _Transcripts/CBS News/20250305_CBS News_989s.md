# Latest reactions to Trump's address to Congress
**CBS News:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA)
*  Right off the top, did you see it? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump addressing a joint session of Congress [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=1.8s)]
*  for one hour and 40 minutes. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=4.32s)]
*  So here are just a few of those moments [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=6.48s)]
*  that we'll be talking about this hour. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=8.52s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=9.96s)]
*  America is back. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=11.82s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=13.48s)]
*  And our country will be woke no longer. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=16.16s)]
*  We believe that whether you are a doctor, an accountant, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=20.56s)]
*  a lawyer, or an air traffic controller, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=23.92s)]
*  you should be hired and promoted based on skill [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=28.16s)]
*  and competence, not race or gender. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=31.32s)]
*  Just listen to some of the appalling waste. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=33.72s)]
*  $8 million to promote LGBTQI+, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=36.56s)]
*  in the African nation of Lesotho, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  which nobody has ever heard of. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=44.8s)]
*  Whatever they tariff us, other countries, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=46.56s)]
*  we will tariff them. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=50.0s)]
*  That's reciprocal, back and forth. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  My fellow Americans, get ready for an incredible future [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=53.92s)]
*  because the golden age of America has only just begun. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=57.4s)]
*  So here are the headlines the day after [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=64.12s)]
*  that really have a lot of you talking around the water cooler, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=66.12s)]
*  percolating right now the Washington Post. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  Defiant Trump signals full speed ahead on divisive policies. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=70.84s)]
*  Wall Street Journal right there on your screen. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=75.32s)]
*  Trump's swift and unrelenting action [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=77.28s)]
*  tests Americans' appetite for upheaval. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=79.32s)]
*  And the New York Times. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=82.2s)]
*  A combative Trump says America is back [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=84.16000000000001s)]
*  and taunts his political rivals. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  CBS News 24-7 with team coverage right now. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=89.48s)]
*  CBS News, Congressional Reporter Tory and Small [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  at the ready there on Capitol Hill. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  But first, CBS News politics and White House Executive Director, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=95.92s)]
*  my friend, Finn Gomez, also at the ready always. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  Finn, so if Americans tune in hoping to see anything [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=102.36000000000001s)]
*  that unites both parties, this was not the broadcast. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=104.72s)]
*  No, that's right, Reid. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=110.2s)]
*  If I were to describe last night's speech in three words, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=112.48s)]
*  I think it would be defiant, divisive, and dramatic, frankly. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  And I think, you know, they had said, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=119.88s)]
*  the White House had said prior to the speech [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=122.16s)]
*  that it would end on unity. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=123.88s)]
*  It really wasn't that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=126.12s)]
*  It really was this sort of defined optimism [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=127.28s)]
*  that we've been seeing from President Trump [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=129.52s)]
*  really touting what he's called these major achievements [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=131.52s)]
*  in his first 43 days in office, back in office, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  including on immigration, on the administration efforts [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=138.44s)]
*  to cut government spending, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=142.16s)]
*  and of course, thousands of federal jobs. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=143.4s)]
*  But it did remind me, Reid, of the campaign speeches [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  that we heard from him over the course [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=150.84s)]
*  of the 2024 political cycle. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=153.44s)]
*  You know, in my career, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  I've covered about 80 Trump rallies altogether, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  and it really reminded me of that sort of tenor. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=161.16000000000003s)]
*  And of course, it was one of the longest speeches, as you said. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=163.8s)]
*  It was the longest speech in modern American history [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=167.4s)]
*  in terms of addresses to Congress at 100 minutes. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=170.16s)]
*  And yes, he did talk about some forms of unity [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=174.6s)]
*  on some aspects, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=178.68s)]
*  but really it was one of tremendous divisiveness [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=179.88s)]
*  and really this almost, this really defiant tone [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=183.72s)]
*  and really went after the Democrats on several aspects. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=189.12s)]
*  They even called them radical left lunatics. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=193.48s)]
*  And if you recall, Reid, he mentioned Joe Biden 13 times, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=195.4s)]
*  called him the worst president in history, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=199.72s)]
*  in the history of America. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=202.24s)]
*  Well, he also made news on something [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=205.0s)]
*  that I wanna drill down on [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  because it's going to command some dinnertime headlines. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=207.72s)]
*  He announced the arrest of the Afghanistan [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=210.0s)]
*  Abbey Gates suspect last night. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=211.56s)]
*  So for our viewers who don't remember [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=213.52s)]
*  what we're talking about, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=215.24s)]
*  that was the bombing in Afghanistan [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=216.16s)]
*  that tragically took the lives of 13 US service members. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=218.60000000000002s)]
*  So what do we know about this arrest [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=221.32s)]
*  that was talked about in this very political speech? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=223.28s)]
*  You're right, Reid. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=227.96s)]
*  Not only was it 13 American service members, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=229.44s)]
*  but about 170 Afghans who were also killed [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=231.68s)]
*  in that bombing in 2021 [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=235.16s)]
*  at Karzai International Airport in Kabul. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  We do know that Mohamed Sharifullah, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=240.76000000000002s)]
*  who US officials say was behind this, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=243.44s)]
*  one of the masterminds of the Abbey Gate bombing, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=246.8s)]
*  was captured about 10 days ago, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=250.96s)]
*  officials said to CBS News [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  and along with cooperation [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=257.12s)]
*  with Pakistani intelligence and the CIA, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  he will now be, he's back, he's been extradited, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=263.44s)]
*  he's on US soil, and he will be at a hearing later [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=266.04s)]
*  in the DC area in Alexandria, Virginia. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  So we'll be hearing more out of that hearing. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=273.56s)]
*  But yes, it was one of these moments [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=276.6s)]
*  during last night's speech, Reid. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  What the president does like to do [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=281.16s)]
*  is sort of reveal these very signature of him [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=282.76s)]
*  to reveal some of these sort of momentous moments [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=286.56s)]
*  that he's famous for, somewhat performative, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=290.28s)]
*  but here in this one, some really hard news here [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=292.88s)]
*  in terms of what he said about Mohamed Sharifullah [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=296.35999999999996s)]
*  and his capture. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=300.08s)]
*  Yeah, you really got a sense he was planting the flag [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  in something that he really hammered [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=303.08s)]
*  then President Joe Biden about [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=305.71999999999997s)]
*  on the campaign trail for sure. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=307.47999999999996s)]
*  Finn, we know this, we live in an era [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=310.2s)]
*  where guests, members of Congress [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=312.32s)]
*  who are there in the gallery are there often [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=314.8s)]
*  to punctuate political positions and get messages out there. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=318.12s)]
*  What did you see by way of the guest lineup [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=321.8s)]
*  and the points that were being made? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=324.04s)]
*  He is also, President Trump, in covering all of his addresses [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=328.44s)]
*  to Congress, the State of the Union speeches, addresses. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=333.52s)]
*  He has these moments, and as do all American presidents, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=336.44s)]
*  frankly, in modern history where they have [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  really made famous at first by Ronald Reagan, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=342.08000000000004s)]
*  where they have these guests to sort of illustrate points [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=344.32s)]
*  of their policy or other aspects. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=347.64000000000004s)]
*  And with President Trump at times, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=351.0s)]
*  it's these moments that these images [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=353.8s)]
*  that people could sort of rally around, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=356.76s)]
*  that Americans can sort of rally around. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=358.48s)]
*  One of them was DJ Daniel, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=360.0s)]
*  who's a 13-year-old cancer survivor [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=363.0s)]
*  who had dreamed of being a police officer [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  and he was named last night by President Trump [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  as an honorary Secret Service agent. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=371.96s)]
*  There's also, he announced the admission to West Point [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=374.68s)]
*  for a high school student. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=377.4s)]
*  And of course, like we reported and mentioned, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=379.0s)]
*  the capture of this alleged terrorist [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=381.71999999999997s)]
*  behind the Abbey Gate bombing. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=383.44s)]
*  I do also want to say, Reed, that I think it also, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=384.91999999999996s)]
*  I talked about the dramatic components last night [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=388.52s)]
*  and the vicinities that we saw last night. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=390.52s)]
*  I did speak to some senior House Democrats [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=392.2s)]
*  after the address last night, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=395.79999999999995s)]
*  and this source told me that there was, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=397.64s)]
*  it was a bit of a optical misstep [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=400.56s)]
*  by some Democrats in the gallery who did not, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=404.47999999999996s)]
*  on the floor, who walked out, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=409.47999999999996s)]
*  who, Representative Al Green from Texas, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=411.35999999999996s)]
*  who demonstrably got up and accused the president [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=414.4s)]
*  of not having a mandate. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=418.96s)]
*  These moments, politically, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=420.68s)]
*  may not have really set the message [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=422.84s)]
*  they were hoping to, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=425.35999999999996s)]
*  to really focus on the federal workers being laid off [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=426.24s)]
*  on the proposed cuts to Medicaid [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=430.92s)]
*  and really showcase what you're seeing as a division [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=433.59999999999997s)]
*  within the Democratic Party, Reed, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  whether to be more aggressive, as we saw last night, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=439.44s)]
*  or to sort of do a tactical pause [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=442.8s)]
*  as James Carville and former Speaker Pelosi [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=445.64s)]
*  have called for to sort of allow the president [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=448.03999999999996s)]
*  and his administration, they say, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=451.4s)]
*  to sort of entangle themselves [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=453.16s)]
*  in some of their controversies that they're creating. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  So really, it showcased right now [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=458.6s)]
*  what Democrats are really searching for [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=461.0s)]
*  in terms of a unified message [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=463.72s)]
*  against the counter-President Trump [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=466.64000000000004s)]
*  and his administration. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=469.44000000000005s)]
*  But I did think that Senator Slotkin's rebuttal, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=470.28000000000003s)]
*  I heard back from many Democrats on that, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=473.24s)]
*  who said that they thought that her speech last night [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=475.08000000000004s)]
*  was very positive and a very strong speech. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=477.6s)]
*  It really met the moment and really spoke to voters [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=479.92s)]
*  on kitchen table issues, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=485.04s)]
*  issues that really matter to them, Reed. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=486.56s)]
*  But the old question is, and you know the old phrase, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=488.56s)]
*  does it play in Peoria? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=491.04s)]
*  That is the question, and we'll start to see reaction, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=492.76s)]
*  especially at those town halls. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=495.04s)]
*  Finn Gomez, always great to talk to you. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=496.6s)]
*  Have a great day there in Washington. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=498.8s)]
*  Well, Trump's speech to Congress [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=501.0s)]
*  played out along party lines. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=502.36s)]
*  We all saw that. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=503.8s)]
*  It earned applause from Republicans, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=505.12s)]
*  boos from Democrats, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=506.92s)]
*  some of which Finn just talked about. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=508.12s)]
*  lawmakers across the aisle took the opportunity [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=510.16s)]
*  to voice that strong opposition to the President's agenda. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=512.08s)]
*  And look here, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=515.44s)]
*  we're talking about a number of women in Congress. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=516.28s)]
*  They wore the color pink, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=518.04s)]
*  asserting Trump's policies negatively affect [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=519.24s)]
*  women and children. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=521.68s)]
*  They're the same group who, by the way, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=523.2s)]
*  wore white during the President's first joint session [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=524.4s)]
*  back in 2017. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=527.08s)]
*  At that time, they used color and coordinating colors [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=528.12s)]
*  to call attention to President Trump's position [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=531.52s)]
*  on reproductive rights. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=534.48s)]
*  Democrats also held signs that read, quote, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=536.04s)]
*  Musk steals, save Medicaid and lies. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=538.56s)]
*  In fact, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=542.3199999999999s)]
*  brought a whiteboard to the speech [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=544.4399999999999s)]
*  where in real time she responded to Trump's claims. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=546.1999999999999s)]
*  Other Democrats wore t-shirts saying, no kings here. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=549.92s)]
*  Several Democrats, as Finn just talked about in reference, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=553.56s)]
*  walked out in protest shortly after [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=556.36s)]
*  the President stood to speak. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=558.64s)]
*  Now that all reached a climax [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=560.8s)]
*  and likely you've seen this [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=562.56s)]
*  on your social media feed and elsewhere [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=563.8399999999999s)]
*  when this Texas Congressman, Al Green, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=565.64s)]
*  stood up and shouted down the President during his speech. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=568.12s)]
*  Republicans in the gallery responded, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=571.64s)]
*  and you heard it, with USA chants. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=574.44s)]
*  Now watch what happened next. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=576.48s)]
*  Members of Congress. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=578.64s)]
*  Finding that members continue to engage in willful [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=579.76s)]
*  and concerted disruption of proper decorum, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=582.32s)]
*  the chair now directs the sergeant-at-arms [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=584.52s)]
*  to restore order. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=586.36s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=587.52s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=588.36s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=589.2s)]
*  Remove this gentleman from the chamber. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=590.28s)]
*  So a reminder for our viewers, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=593.0s)]
*  Mr. Green, who you see there being removed from chambers, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=594.36s)]
*  is the one who's called for the impeachment [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=597.36s)]
*  of President Trump during both of his terms now. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=598.96s)]
*  He later out in the hall explained his decision, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=601.72s)]
*  saying the President does not have the right [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=603.84s)]
*  to take away healthcare from Americans. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=605.72s)]
*  He just moments ago, we got some insight [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=609.24s)]
*  into how Democrats feel about that speech [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=611.12s)]
*  more than 12 hours later. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=613.36s)]
*  Here's House Minority Whip, Catherine Clark. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=614.96s)]
*  So I am angry today. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=618.12s)]
*  I am angry when I saw that that President [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=621.12s)]
*  of the United States who ran and had people vote for him [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=624.4s)]
*  because he said he was gonna cut their costs. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=628.2s)]
*  He was gonna make sure they had a chance [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=630.88s)]
*  that the American dream has come in [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=632.96s)]
*  with an unelected, richest man on earth [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=636.4s)]
*  and taken a chainsaw to everything we care about. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=639.24s)]
*  Everything the American people put their trust in him to do. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=642.44s)]
*  It is a betrayal. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=646.28s)]
*  So that is the talk the day after, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=648.72s)]
*  you know who is there recording it all in real time, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=650.52s)]
*  correspondent, Torian Small. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=653.16s)]
*  Torian, it is the day after. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=654.88s)]
*  A part of that speech called for action [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=657.04s)]
*  by Congress on many points. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=659.44s)]
*  What is the action there in Congress today? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=661.9200000000001s)]
*  Erie, though this speech sounded more like a campaign rally, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=666.52s)]
*  Donald Trump did have quite a bit of instructive things [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=671.12s)]
*  to say to the Republican side of the House that was present. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=674.6800000000001s)]
*  He in fact directed House Speaker Mike Johnson [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=678.92s)]
*  at several points to get the ball rolling [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=682.48s)]
*  on more funding for deportations, border security, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=685.64s)]
*  as well as the start to build to a golden dome [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=690.04s)]
*  like missile defense system, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=694.28s)]
*  quite a few things that gave us really an insight [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=696.24s)]
*  into his legislative priorities in his second term here. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=699.04s)]
*  We also know separately from what the president [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=703.92s)]
*  asked of Congress that House Speaker Johnson said [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=707.16s)]
*  that it's likely that Representative Green [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=710.92s)]
*  will receive a censure. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=713.32s)]
*  The House Freedom Caucus also said they're going to move forward [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=714.8s)]
*  with legislation to see that happen sooner than later [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=717.16s)]
*  for that disruption. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=720.08s)]
*  Torian, got to ask you about this. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=721.5600000000001s)]
*  We've confirmed that Texas Congressman Sylvester Turner [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=723.5600000000001s)]
*  died after attending last night's presidential address. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=725.92s)]
*  Really quickly, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=729.08s)]
*  had this to say about that just moments ago. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=731.08s)]
*  It is with a heavy heart that we gather here today, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=734.12s)]
*  having received the news that our dear colleague [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=740.68s)]
*  and a tremendous public servant, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=744.08s)]
*  the Honorable Sylvester Turner passed away [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=747.24s)]
*  tragically and unexpectedly. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=752.12s)]
*  He was a powerful, profound, principled public servant [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=755.16s)]
*  who was beloved in his hometown of Houston, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=760.24s)]
*  served his hometown in the state legislature as mayor, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=763.48s)]
*  and over the last few months as a member of Congress. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=769.8s)]
*  He was a champion for all that we stand here today to protect. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=776.8s)]
*  So I thought it appropriate that we just begin [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=782.96s)]
*  with a brief moment of silence. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=785.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=809.5600000000001s)]
*  So that moment of silence there, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=812.24s)]
*  Torian, age 70, attended last night. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=813.82s)]
*  What happened, what do you know? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=816.22s)]
*  Yeah, no word on the cause of death just yet, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=819.6600000000001s)]
*  but this is relatively shocking news to many. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=822.2800000000001s)]
*  He was spotted on the Hill for a legislative business [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=825.0200000000001s)]
*  not too long ago. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=828.22s)]
*  This news came to the surprise of many members [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=829.7800000000001s)]
*  that we're hearing from today. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=833.22s)]
*  I also should mention that he was just elected to serve [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=835.46s)]
*  considering he replaced Sheila Jackson Lee, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=841.38s)]
*  who also passed away not too long ago. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=844.46s)]
*  He's known as a career politician, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=847.94s)]
*  as the leader just said there that he was most known [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=850.1800000000001s)]
*  for being the 62nd mayor of Houston. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=854.44s)]
*  He also served in the Houston [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=857.2s)]
*  or the Texas House of Representatives. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=859.1800000000001s)]
*  So quite the legacy he's had in public service [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=861.5s)]
*  and Democrats are doing their best today [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=864.4200000000001s)]
*  to make sure they honor his memory. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=866.26s)]
*  Torian, thank you for that update. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=869.22s)]
*  I know a lot of Americans grieve his loss. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=870.86s)]
*  Now we're gonna show our viewers something on the screen [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=872.9s)]
*  while we have this conversation with you, Torian. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=875.1s)]
*  This is really the power of CBS News 24 seven. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=876.98s)]
*  You see our partners in New York, Boston and CBS Colorado, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=879.1s)]
*  and they're all following this hearing. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=883.5600000000001s)]
*  It's a sanctuary city hearing for immigration [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=886.26s)]
*  in the spotlight is this very hotly contested issue. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=889.74s)]
*  And that's why those cities that are seen [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=892.82s)]
*  as sanctuary cities are covering this. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=894.98s)]
*  What do you know about those hearings happening right now? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=897.3399999999999s)]
*  Well, it's likely that Republicans are looking [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=902.4599999999999s)]
*  to utilize this platform to underscore what they see [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=904.68s)]
*  as major problems for the president, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=907.66s)]
*  utilizing this hearing to get mayors of these liberal cities [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=910.2199999999999s)]
*  to testify about what they have or haven't been doing [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=915.62s)]
*  when it comes to working with the president [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=918.9s)]
*  for his mass deportation operation. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=920.8599999999999s)]
*  It's likely that we'll hear from Republican members [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=923.38s)]
*  of this committee on how ineffective [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=926.24s)]
*  their leadership has been and how consequential it could be [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=929.5600000000001s)]
*  to this overall mission that Donald Trump is looking [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=932.64s)]
*  to push forward when it comes to immigration reform. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=935.72s)]
*  So far, we're probably just into, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=939.36s)]
*  just shortly after opening statements. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=942.46s)]
*  But again, the point that Republicans are making here [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=944.52s)]
*  is that these cities run by Democrats [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=948.64s)]
*  are allowing immigration, illegal immigration to exist. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=952.24s)]
*  And it is their intent moving forward to punish them [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=956.72s)]
*  to cartel what they see as a problem. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=961.08s)]
*  Torian Small, while you hold the fort there, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=963.84s)]
*  so to speak, on a national perspective, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=966.76s)]
*  that's the power of this broadcast right here [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=968.96s)]
*  from our monitors, able to show in real time [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=970.72s)]
*  that reaction community to community to community. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=973.6800000000001s)]
*  Our crews are there. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=976.76s)]
*  Torian Small, we appreciate you being where you are right now. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=977.92s)]
*  We'll continue watching these monitors now [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=980.4s)]
*  for the local conversations as it relates to that hearing [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=982.84s)]
*  on Capitol Hill regarding sanctuary cities. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXPKOi7_MbA&t=985.92s)]
