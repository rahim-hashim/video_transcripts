# Judge wants additional arguments on Eric Adams corruption charges potentially being dropped
**CBS News:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8)
*  New York City Mayor Eric Adams' corruption trial has been indefinitely postponed, but [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=0.0s)]
*  the charges against him have yet to be dismissed altogether. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=4.0s)]
*  Judge Dale Ho is appointing conservative attorney Paul Clement to present additional arguments [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=7.76s)]
*  challenging the Justice Department's decision to drop charges against Adams. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=12.52s)]
*  President Trump's Justice Department says the charges prevent the Democratic mayor from [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=17.48s)]
*  helping to implement the president's agenda in New York. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=20.96s)]
*  The decision prompted the angry resignations of several high-ranking prosecutors who called [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=23.88s)]
*  the deal a quid pro quo. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=28.84s)]
*  Jake Rosen joins us now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=31.0s)]
*  Jake, I remember when we had this hearing a couple days ago, our own Scott McFarland [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=32.44s)]
*  said that no one was arguing for the citizens in this case. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=36.08s)]
*  Is that why this prosecutor is being brought in? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=40.8s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=43.96s)]
*  Paul Clement is going to be brought in as a friend of the court to answer some of the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=45.44s)]
*  judge's questions on the constitutionality of this agreement, to work through some of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=49.16s)]
*  the conversations that happened in court on Monday, and basically represent an opposition [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=54.56s)]
*  in the courtroom. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=59.68s)]
*  As you just pointed out, Lindsay, there was none because the Department of Justice, Mayor [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=60.68s)]
*  Adams and Mayor Adams' attorneys were all in agreement that the case should be dropped, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=63.92s)]
*  and Judge Dale Ho was basically left out of that conversation, and so he needs to bring [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=67.8s)]
*  someone else into the courtroom to basically counter the arguments made in court, that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=72.6s)]
*  A, there was no quote quid pro quo, which both Adams and the Department of Justice said [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=77.16s)]
*  But also to challenge the executive authority that the Justice Department is taking here [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=82.68s)]
*  to basically take the case out of local prosecution in the Southern District of New York, make [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  it a national issue, as the third in command of the Justice Department came in to drop [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=93.36000000000001s)]
*  the case, and we'll see what happens. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=97.0s)]
*  The next hearing will potentially be on March 14th with some violings due in a couple of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=99.2s)]
*  weeks. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=104.64000000000001s)]
*  Okay, and let's turn now to the newly confirmed FBI Director Kash Patel's first day on the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=105.64000000000001s)]
*  job. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=108.84s)]
*  How is it shaping up so far? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=109.84s)]
*  Well, in an email to FBI staff that our CBS News colleagues got here, Patel pledged to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=111.0s)]
*  work with the FBI agents and to both streamline operations, which he says is taking people [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=116.12s)]
*  out of headquarters just down the road here in D.C. and putting them back into the field, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=121.84s)]
*  but also in terms ofâ€”he said that he wanted to reestablish trust in the FBI. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=127.16s)]
*  And now that is easier said than done when Kash Patel himself has really criticized the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  wrote a book about the FBI and their involvement in going after President Trump, but also there [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=139.04s)]
*  are allegations, at least by some in the Senate, that Kash Patel has been involved in these [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=143.64s)]
*  firings of FBI agents and career law enforcement officials, in addition to that list of thousands [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=148.54s)]
*  of FBI agents who worked on these January 6th investigations. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  What is the purpose of that list, right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=160.12s)]
*  Where is that list going? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=161.92s)]
*  There are some big outstanding questions, and Kash Patel will officially be sworn in [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=162.92s)]
*  in a more ceremonial action later today at the White House with Attorney General Pan [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=166.16s)]
*  Bondi. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=170.72s)]
*  Jake Rosen, thank you. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA6BuC-yGT8&t=171.72s)]
