**CBS News:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE)
*  helicopter to pass behind the regional jet. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=0.0s)]
*  Why didn't that happen? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4.24s)]
*  We just don't know yet. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5.38s)]
*  These are some of the key questions [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7.24s)]
*  and they're still searching for the flight data [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8.6s)]
*  and flight voice recorders. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11.0s)]
*  Chris Van Cleave with his latest reporting on this tragedy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12.32s)]
*  Chris, thank you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15.72s)]
*  Now we know that the helicopter involved in this crash [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17.52s)]
*  was a Black Hawk military helicopter. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20.2s)]
*  CBS News Pentagon reporter Eleanor Watson [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22.64s)]
*  is following this angle of the story for us. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  And Ellie, you are close to where DCA is. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27.799999999999997s)]
*  The Pentagon sits right next to Reagan National Airport [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30.68s)]
*  in some ways. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34.56s)]
*  Tell us more about this helicopter on its training flight. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35.56s)]
*  What is the Army telling us? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39.2s)]
*  Air Army officials have told us that three soldiers [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42.08s)]
*  were on board. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=45.08s)]
*  They were on the Black Hawk, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=46.2s)]
*  which was based out of Fort Belvoir, Virginia. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=48.34s)]
*  They were part of the 12th Aviation Battalion. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=51.0s)]
*  We don't know if this helicopter was one of the helicopters [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=54.04s)]
*  that is usually involved in transporting [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=58.8s)]
*  senior DOD officials, senior Pentagon officials, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  Army officials, but we are told [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=64.12s)]
*  that there were no senior VIPs. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=66.44s)]
*  The status of the three soldiers is still unknown, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=68.64s)]
*  is part of the search efforts today. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=72.18s)]
*  We learned from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegs [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=74.16s)]
*  at the last night that the Army is contributing [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=76.88s)]
*  to investigating this matter. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=79.25999999999999s)]
*  The NTSB, as Chris and Erin have said, will be the lead, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=81.92s)]
*  but the Army is certainly looking into the questions [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=85.96s)]
*  that Chris raised of what was this Black Hawk doing [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=88.28s)]
*  on the flight path it was on? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  Was that part of the training mission, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=94.82s)]
*  and why was it flying at the altitude it was flying? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=96.3s)]
*  That's right, and we expect to hear from the NTSB [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  in minutes when this press conference begins, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=101.5s)]
*  but Ellie, you're helping us understand [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=104.0s)]
*  that most of the questions at this very early stage, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=105.86s)]
*  and as I've said, we're in the first 12 hours [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  of this tragedy, they appear to be more focused [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=110.76s)]
*  on what the Black Hawk helicopter was doing [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  rather than a flight moving across its typical flight path. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  Is there any indication from the Pentagon [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=120.18s)]
*  on if this is a standard training flight, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=122.28s)]
*  or any clue that they had deviated from protocol at all? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=125.66000000000001s)]
*  That will be part of the initial questions. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=131.28s)]
*  I will say, as Chris mentioned, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=133.84s)]
*  there are military helicopter flights [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=136.0s)]
*  over the Potomac pretty regularly. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=139.9s)]
*  You have Fort Belvoir, where this helicopter [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=142.32s)]
*  was based out of, you have Joint Base Anacostia bowling, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=144.82s)]
*  you have Fort McNair, there are many bases around, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=148.06s)]
*  as well as the Pentagon, and these Black Hawks [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=153.18s)]
*  do participate in transporting officials [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=156.86s)]
*  from place to place. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=159.94s)]
*  So the fact that a helicopter was flying at night, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=161.22s)]
*  maybe doing a training mission at night, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=164.06s)]
*  not too irregular, but it will be part of the questions [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=165.66s)]
*  as to why that flight path and why at that altitude. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=169.98s)]
*  Ellie Watson giving us the latest [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=174.1s)]
*  out of the Pentagon this morning. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=175.7s)]
*  Ellie, stay close, we will of course reconnect [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=177.0s)]
*  with you later this morning. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=179.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=181.14s)]
*  Human remains and plane debris have been washing up [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=181.98s)]
*  on the shore of the Potomac River this morning. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=185.38s)]
*  After that deadly midair collision, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=188.28s)]
*  we're standing by for a briefing from officials [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=190.42s)]
*  in Washington and in Virginia, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=193.1s)]
*  and we'll bring it to you live after this short break. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=195.02s)]
*  Stay right there. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=197.18s)]
*  He pointed a gun to me and said, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=228.26000000000002s)]
*  this is the day you die, and he shot me. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=229.74s)]
*  Real justice. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=232.70000000000002s)]
*  There's some questions that have to be asked [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=234.38000000000002s)]
*  and need to be answered. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=236.26000000000002s)]
*  I'm an innocent man and I hope the whole world [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=237.54000000000002s)]
*  can see it now. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=239.62s)]

*  Listen to 48 hours on Apple podcasts. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=241.86s)]
*  Okay, so let's just start at the beginning. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=244.70000000000002s)]
*  Well, let me start with this. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=246.02s)]
*  What is at stake here? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=247.34s)]
*  What is the answer then? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=248.5s)]
*  Do you know why? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=249.46s)]
*  You want me to just keep going? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=250.78s)]
*  Is that a good thing or a bad thing? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=251.94s)]
*  Were there death threats? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=253.02s)]
*  How is this possible? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=254.14000000000001s)]
*  What's wrong with that art? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=255.14000000000001s)]
*  Are you saying they lied? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=256.18s)]
*  Have you told the government that? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=257.38s)]
*  Why won't you say the word crisis? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=258.65999999999997s)]
*  You're not answering my question. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=260.06s)]
*  This really is scary. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=261.09999999999997s)]

*  Yeah this pressure happening imminently [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=432.90000000000003s)]
*  and earlier today we heard from law enforcement agencies [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=435.14000000000004s)]
*  across the capital region about just how expansive [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=438.74s)]
*  this search and rescue mission has been [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=442.5s)]
*  with over 300 personnel on the ground and in the water. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=444.98s)]
*  Of course the big question remaining, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=449.34000000000003s)]
*  are there any survivors? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=452.22s)]
*  How many bodies have been recovered? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=453.82s)]
*  A law enforcement source telling CBS News [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=455.9s)]

*  from authorities just regarding how much debris, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=467.02s)]
*  how many individuals they were able to actually pull [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=471.29999999999995s)]
*  from the water here. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=474.26s)]
*  And authorities could also tell us a little bit more [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=476.05999999999995s)]
*  about when we will switch from this being a search [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=479.7s)]
*  and recovery mission to specifically more [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=482.26000000000005s)]
*  of a salvage mission. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=485.98s)]
*  We know that investigators are also on the ground [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=487.1s)]
*  with the NTSB, the National Transportation Safety Board. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=489.86s)]
*  They are the lead on this investigation. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=493.86s)]
*  We are waiting to hear what they were able to recover [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=496.42s)]
*  on the scene, what they'll be looking for. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=499.26000000000005s)]
*  Of course we know that investigators right now [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=501.70000000000005s)]
*  are very focused on why this Army Blackhawk helicopter [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=504.34000000000003s)]
*  was flying at such a low altitude near the airport. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=508.98s)]
*  Everyone asking that question today. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=513.26s)]
*  Beyond that, of course we know that there were 60 passengers [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=516.1s)]
*  and four crew members aboard the plane [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=519.3000000000001s)]
*  in addition to three Army soldiers in that Blackhawk. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=521.86s)]
*  But we know few details regarding who was on that flight. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=525.7s)]
*  So hoping that authorities might also share [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=530.34s)]
*  a little bit more with us about some of those victims there. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=532.9s)]
*  Still so many questions, Nicole. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=538.14s)]
*  Thank you so much. Stand by a second. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=539.54s)]
*  Let us know when that press conference start. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=541.18s)]
*  But for now, let's go to our senior transportation [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=542.5799999999999s)]
*  correspondent, Chris Van Cleave. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=544.66s)]
*  Chris. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=546.2199999999999s)]
*  Adriana, those helicopters are supposed to fly [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=549.0999999999999s)]
*  at 200 feet or less when they approach the arrival pattern [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=552.26s)]
*  or the departure pattern for Washington Reagan Airport. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=556.8199999999999s)]
*  We were up in the DC police helicopter [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=560.14s)]
*  just a couple of weeks ago ahead of the inauguration. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=562.3s)]
*  When we approached the area that was under Reagan tower control, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=564.26s)]
*  we very quickly descended from about 850 feet down below 200 feet [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=569.4200000000001s)]
*  for that very reason to be out of the way [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=574.38s)]
*  of the commercial airline traffic that was operating. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=577.1800000000001s)]
*  So one of the things that investigators are going to want [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=580.14s)]
*  to try to understand here is if the preliminary flight data [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=582.94s)]
*  is correct, why the helicopter appears to perhaps have been [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=587.14s)]
*  above that 200 foot, what I would call a hard deck [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=590.26s)]
*  for those helicopters. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=594.6600000000001s)]
*  Obviously, a priority is going to be getting the black boxes, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=598.0600000000001s)]
*  the cockpit voice recorder, the cockpit data recorder. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=601.5s)]
*  There was some reports last night that a team thought [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=605.34s)]
*  they may have found at least one of them. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=607.58s)]
*  So that may be an update we get today from the NTSB. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=609.7s)]
*  Back inside to you, Adriana. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=612.9000000000001s)]
*  All right, Chris. Thank you so much. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=614.1800000000001s)]

*  who acted quickly last night, who ran towards danger, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=731.86s)]
*  went into a very frigid river, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=736.38s)]
*  and have worked throughout the night. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=739.34s)]

*  and those teams have worked together throughout the night [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=749.74s)]
*  in really tough and heartbreaking conditions. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=753.0200000000001s)]

*  We wish we were gathering for different purposes today. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=781.14s)]
*  Just want to let you know that the Department of Transportation, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=786.4200000000001s)]

*  if you live in the D.C. area, you would know that this was [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=813.18s)]

*  The helicopter was in a standard pattern. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=819.9s)]
*  If you live in the D.C. area, you'll see helicopters [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=822.86s)]
*  up and down the river. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=824.78s)]
*  This flight pattern is seen oftentimes when you live in D.C. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=826.5s)]
*  This was a standard flight pattern last night as well. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=829.9799999999999s)]
*  The American Airlines flight coming into land [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=833.2199999999999s)]
*  was in a standard flight pattern as it was coming into D.C.A. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=836.18s)]
*  So this was not unusual with military aircraft [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=841.18s)]
*  flying the river and aircraft landing at D.C.A. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=845.98s)]
*  And again, if you live in the area, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=849.9000000000001s)]
*  you'll see that frequently with those two aircraft [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=851.62s)]
*  working together. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=858.1s)]
*  As many of you have reported, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=863.1400000000001s)]
*  we have located the two aircrafts. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=864.74s)]
*  The fuselage of the American Airline plane was inverted. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=869.5400000000001s)]
*  It's been located in three different sections. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=874.86s)]
*  It's in about waist deep water. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=878.98s)]
*  So that recovery is gonna go on today [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=881.42s)]
*  as that recovery takes place of the fuselage [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=884.14s)]
*  of the aircraft. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=887.3s)]
*  NTSB is going to start to analyze that aircraft, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=888.9s)]
*  partner with the FAA with all the information we have [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=892.86s)]

*  I would just say that safety is our expectation. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=899.8199999999999s)]
*  Everyone who flies in American skies [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=904.54s)]

*  That didn't happen last night. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=915.14s)]
*  And I know that President Trump, his administration, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=917.18s)]

*  the Virginia Congressional delegation to the podium next. US Senator Mark [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1395.8000000000002s)]
*  Warner, followed by Tim Kane and Representative Don Beyer. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1402.8000000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Mayor. I want to join with everyone else and express my [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1408.8400000000001s)]
*  condolences for the victims. For folks who don't live in the DMV, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1412.48s)]
*  we are made up of a lot of jurisdictions. Reagan Airport's in Virginia. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1420.48s)]
*  Across the river, we have Maryland, obviously the district, but has been [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1427.28s)]
*  indicated by the chief. When tragedy happens, all those distinctions [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1431.8s)]
*  between the various jurisdictions and our federal partners all disappear. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1437.52s)]
*  And I want to again thank all the first responders. On a personal note, I'll [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1441.72s)]
*  just add that [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1446.56s)]
*  literally, I now know I was coming back from the district from a dinner to my [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1448.82s)]
*  home in old town Alexandria. And while I did not see the collision, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1454.8s)]
*  um, I wondered, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1460.8400000000001s)]
*  I'd never seen this many red lights streaming towards the airport and [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1463.88s)]
*  across the river in Maryland about this time. Um, my phone started blowing up, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1468.88s)]
*  and I realized that this accident taking place. There'll be a time to [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1473.04s)]
*  figure out, I know NTSB will have a briefing later in the day. Um, but to [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1476.64s)]
*  the victims, our condolences to the first responders are thanks. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1482.3600000000001s)]
*  Um, sorrow, thanks and questions. So sorrow, as all have expressed to the [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1490.04s)]
*  crew, to the passengers, to the soldiers, to their families, to their [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1496.56s)]
*  friends, their loved ones, to people who are still trying to get information [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1500.76s)]
*  and unsure whether their loved ones have been lost. We offer our profound [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1504.96s)]
*  condolences to them and our sorrow for this tragedy. Thanks. I'll echo Mayor [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1511.6000000000001s)]
*  what you began with when you see a challenge like this and you see people [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1516.2s)]
*  from so many different agencies, local, state, federal, with different [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1521.16s)]
*  uniforms, different badges, but working in such a coordinated way. Even in the [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1524.68s)]
*  midst of a tragedy, it does give you a sense of appreciation and pride in [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1529.38s)]
*  people's willingness to come to the danger and work together. And I started [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1534.0400000000002s)]
*  to see that as a local official 30 years ago in Richmond and definitely have [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1539.44s)]
*  seen it here. And then finally questions. There are gonna be a lot of [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1543.24s)]
*  questions, obviously a lot of questions. And that's what the NTSB's job is, is [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1546.72s)]
*  to be an independent investigator of incidents like this. And they are here. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1552.4s)]
*  We were in dialogue with them earlier today. They've been here since they got [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1556.68s)]
*  the alert and they will be doing the work and playing lead in answering the [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1561.0s)]
*  many questions that we have. And that's as it should be. It's not a time to [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1565.0800000000002s)]
*  speculate. It's a time to investigate and get answers to the questions we [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1568.28s)]
*  need and I have confidence that will be done. Thank you. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1572.4s)]
*  Following up on the Senator, I think grief, thanks and service [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1579.0400000000002s)]
*  with millions and millions of Americans traveling every year. We are all grieving [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1583.8400000000001s)]
*  knowing that it could have been our loved ones. It could have been us and [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1589.0s)]
*  our hearts go out to all those who have lost folks in a most partisan place. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1592.92s)]
*  Also, it's I'm really thankful that Democrats and Republicans, people from [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1598.3200000000002s)]
*  all over have come together to try to make sure that people are served. As a [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1602.28s)]
*  local representative, I want the families to know that our office is [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1607.92s)]
*  available to serve you in any way we possibly can through this time of grief [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1612.16s)]
*  and transition and loss. And then also just note that we're deeply grateful for [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1616.12s)]
*  the people who risked their lives last night on a moment's notice, as we have [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1624.04s)]
*  the whole night on the river and the ice and the wind do serving us. And then [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1627.08s)]
*  finally, as Senator Cain were noted, after the NTSB investigation, we've got [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1632.52s)]
*  to make sure that at the federal level and with the support of Virginia, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1640.0s)]
*  Maryland, D.C., we're doing everything we can to make sure this does not happen [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1643.68s)]
*  again. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1647.28s)]
*  So with that, it's been said already that the National Transportation Safety [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1647.56s)]
*  Board becomes the lead agency in the investigation. Our jurisdiction in D.C., [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1662.24s)]
*  where the crash occurred over the river, is concludes as we in the leadership role [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1670.2s)]
*  of the unified command as we shift to a recovery effort. We expect the National [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1679.88s)]
*  Transportation Safety Board to provide briefings to the press later in the day. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1685.4s)]
*  So at this point, we can take a few questions. Yes. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1691.96s)]
*  What we're talking, what we can talk about today is what happened here with [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1701.2s)]
*  the collision of these vehicles. We said what we know and that the National [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1707.56s)]
*  Transportation Safety Board continues to investigate. I don't know that any of us [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1712.24s)]
*  have been briefed on anything that would suggest any other aircraft are implicated. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1718.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1725.24s)]
*  Chief. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1730.24s)]
*  So the rescue operation or the recovery operation goes on. It's a lot of touch [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1733.6000000000001s)]
*  and feel in the different parts of the plane or in the helicopter and the crash [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1737.88s)]
*  area is a little spread out. So we've got some work to do. And I think it's a [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1743.1200000000001s)]
*  pretty normal type of situation. I don't think it's extraordinary. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1747.4s)]
*  So the wind started blowing last night, so we've had debris travel from the [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1753.24s)]
*  airport down as far as the Wilson Bridge. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1756.96s)]
*  Uh, I couldn't tell you less than a mile. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1760.92s)]
*  Well, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1783.1200000000001s)]
*  we're gonna open the airport at 11 o'clock. It's safe. We've worked with [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1784.52s)]
*  all the federal agencies FAA. And, you know, it's been determined that we can [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1788.24s)]
*  open that airport safely. The recovery effort that's on our property is on the [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1793.3600000000001s)]
*  waterfront. Our primary runway 119 will be open. It's away from any activity. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1798.72s)]
*  We're gonna have a secure area around that. So all are comfortable that we can [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1807.0s)]
*  get back to operations. Now, each airline will announce or communicate [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1812.1599999999999s)]
*  to their passengers what their operations are going to be. Obviously, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1818.76s)]
*  their networks were disrupted overnight, and so we might have a slow recovery. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1824.04s)]
*  But the bottom line is we will begin to have aircraft moving out of this [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1827.92s)]
*  airport at 11 o'clock. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1832.36s)]
*  I don't think we can say anything about what's in in TSB's purview. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1842.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that. Jack, do you have anything to add? We don't [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1857.96s)]
*  have anything to add about that. Yes. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1861.72s)]
*  So the question is, can I guarantee the American flying public that the United [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1872.36s)]
*  States has the most safe and secure airspace in the world? And the answer to [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1876.6399999999999s)]
*  that is absolutely. Yes, we do. We have early indicators of what happened here, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1880.52s)]
*  and I will tell you with complete confidence, we have the safest airspace [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1886.08s)]
*  in the world. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1891.48s)]
*  I can say is that we have published the 1-800 number. We have family [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1902.04s)]
*  assistance centers set up here in DCA. We do in Wichita as well. I'm not at [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1919.2s)]
*  liberty to give the number of families that have been, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1926.12s)]
*  uh, that have used those services. But we are making that use. We have over [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1930.04s)]
*  100 team members that are either here or on their way that are specially [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1936.8s)]
*  trained to work with family members, handle travel arrangements, hotel [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1941.24s)]
*  arrangements, incidentals to make sure that we're taking care of people in any [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1946.48s)]
*  way that they can. As you know, as our teams are hurting and suffering as our [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1950.76s)]
*  passengers and their families need assistance, we're doing everything we [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1956.28s)]
*  can. I don't have any other more information on that right now. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1960.32s)]
*  So the next phase of this operation is going to be led by the NTSB. All of us [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=1986.28s)]
*  are working together though to to search the area and find the victims. I'm [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2001.68s)]
*  confident that we will do that. Um, and that will take us a little bit of time [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2007.24s)]
*  though. Um, it may involve some more equipment as far as the things being [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2011.84s)]
*  collected. I don't have personal knowledge. I know that we have been [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2015.6s)]
*  collecting debris that you would expect to see from a plane. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2018.48s)]
*  Just so the question is about the victims. The NTSB is going to lead that [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2024.36s)]
*  portion of the contact with the victims. I believe American is going to be [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2031.28s)]
*  involved with that as well. And so will the FAA and the Department of [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2034.9199999999998s)]
*  Transportation. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2038.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2045.9199999999998s)]
*  For Secretary Duncan, the flight path that the helicopter was on, is that a common flight path that is almost a helicopter to get through it? Is it cut across through the flight path? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2047.52s)]
*  So, I don't know if you all could hear the question. It's a question about the [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2057.52s)]
*  flight path of the helicopter. I don't want to go into too much detail about [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2063.3199999999997s)]
*  the information we have from the FAA, but obviously it is it is not standard to [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2068.04s)]
*  have aircraft collide. I want to be clear on that. But prior to the collision, the [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2074.88s)]
*  flight paths that were being flown from the military and from American, that was [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2080.8s)]
*  not unusual for what happens in the DC airspace. And as this investigation moves [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2086.6400000000003s)]
*  forward, we will be able to provide more information to you about the details of [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2092.92s)]
*  that statement. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2098.92s)]
*  So the question is, were there blind spots with air traffic control? I don't want to make statements about that. I don't need into that answer. But again, I think whether it was air traffic control, whether it was military aircraft, helicopters, or the American flight, everything is [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2104.8s)]
*  standard in the lead up to the crash. Now, obviously there was something happened here. You'll get more information and more details as this investigation moves forward. We'll learn what happened. But again, those who live in the DC area, we see military helicopters fly up and down the river. It's a standard path that they fly. They're used to aircraft landing at DCA. And there's a procedure that they have to do to get to the aircraft landing. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2129.8s)]
*  And there's a procedure in place because this happens every day. Something went wrong here. I look forward to the time and point when we can give you that information. But I don't want to comment on that right now. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2154.8s)]
*  We have raised this issue continuously. We've got very busy airspace. I think we will ask questions, but at the appropriate time. We are in this period right now where families are still being notified. We're trying to figure out what happened. There'll be time for those discussions. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2185.8s)]
*  Yeah, I just say the same thing. We've been pretty plain about our concerns, but it isn't a good time to speculate right now. We have faith that the NTSB will provide the answers about this. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2202.0s)]
*  So thank you for the question. Our first responders are resilient people, but yes, this call will be hard for them. Our peer support teams are already engaged with the responders, and we'll be following up on that. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2214.8s)]
*  I don't want to say too much on the communication between the helicopter and the tower and the airline and the tower, but I will say this. There was communication. It was, I'm sorry, it was communication between the helicopter and the tower. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2244.8s)]
*  And the airline and the tower, but I will say this. There was communication. It was standard communication. So there was not a breakdown, if that's your question, in communication between the military helicopter and the American airline flight. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2264.8s)]
*  There was communication between the aircraft and the tower. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2284.8s)]
*  The, I would say the helicopter was aware that there was a plane in the area. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2287.8s)]
*  In terms of body recovery, we, as we recover bodies, we have a process and we're not counting anybody's until they're in the possession of the medical director. So there may be some fluctuating in numbers that other people would report, but our numbers from the medical examiner. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2317.8s)]
*  So in regard to the president in the briefing room, I've been with this team for the last hour plus, as we've worked through the details of information we wanted to give you. But it is my understanding that either this morning he was going to be in the situation room or the situation room is obviously briefing the president. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2344.8s)]
*  He has been kept in full appraisal of what is taking place. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2363.8s)]
*  Well, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2374.8s)]
*  I don't have that information quite yet from the FAA, so I don't want to provide an information or I don't want to provide an answer or inaccurate information on what routes will be flown out of DCA. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2395.8s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2410.8s)]
*  Just quickly, I don't have a lot of information to release, but these are experienced pilots. I know that the captain was had six years with with PSA or almost six years with PSA and the first officer almost two years. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2438.8s)]
*  And again, standard approach. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2452.8s)]
*  And that's all about all I can say. Thank you. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2455.8s)]
*  In regard to the military, I don't have information in regard to the experience of the military pilots. I would just note that this was classified as a training mission. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2459.8s)]
*  Sometimes people could think that a training mission is someone who is inexperienced in the cockpit. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2469.8s)]
*  This is we call the these these missions that are flown in the DCA area as our pilots are getting hours and experience training mission. So don't read into that that we had. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2476.8s)]
*  How many hours the pilots on the military aircraft had and you had another question for me that was. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2487.8s)]
*  So so we are going to wait for all the information to come in from from this vantage point, but to to back up what the president said, what I've seen so far, do I think this was preventable? Absolutely. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2501.8s)]
*  All right. You just heard in a news conference that the search for the victims of that deadly midair collision has now turned from a rescue operation to a recovery operation. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2525.8s)]
*  The DC fire and EMS chief says he does not believe there are any survivors, according to what we just heard. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2535.8s)]
*  He said twenty seven bodies have been recovered from people who were on the plane and one body from someone on the helicopter. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2541.8s)]
*  We know that news just has to be absolutely devastating for those families who have been waiting for information about their loved ones. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2548.8s)]
*  And in fact, American Airlines has given out this number. It is one eight hundred six seven nine eight two one five again one eight hundred six seven nine eight two one five. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2554.8s)]
*  If you believe you had a loved one on board that flight, please give that number a call. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2565.8s)]
*  Our coverage of this disaster will continue on CBS mornings, your local news and our streaming channel CBS News 24 seven. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2570.8s)]
*  Many of you now will return to CBS mornings. This has been a CBS News special report. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2577.8s)]
*  We've been watching a CBS News special report on the deadly midair collision near Reagan Airport just outside of Washington. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2594.8s)]
*  I'm Errol Barnett at the CBS Broadcast Center here in New York. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2601.8s)]
*  DC fire officials say they do not believe at this hour there are any survivors. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2604.8s)]
*  First responders are now working on recovery operations and what they've described as extremely difficult conditions there on the Potomac River. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2609.8s)]
*  You're looking at live pictures, the sun just rising there in the nation's capital. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2619.8s)]
*  We heard them say that as first responders headed into the waters to find survivors, they encountered frigid temperatures and ice at this hour. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2623.8s)]
*  Twenty seven bodies have been recovered from the plane and one body from the Black Hawk helicopter. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2633.8s)]
*  This happened fewer than 12 hours ago, so it's still very early. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2639.8s)]
*  U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told reporters there was nothing unusual about the flight path of the American Airlines plane or the helicopter ahead of this crash. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2643.8s)]
*  And we heard him just say moments ago, this was absolutely preventable. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2653.8s)]
*  We'll still listen in to any new information that does come out of that press conference at DCA. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2658.8s)]
*  We also have a phone number for you. If you potentially knew anybody on that aircraft, you're encouraged to call one eight hundred six seven eight. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2664.8s)]
*  To one five to get more information from American Airlines. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2672.8s)]
*  Let's now listen and connect with Jeff Wise. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2677.8s)]
*  He's an aviation journalist and the host of Finding MH370 podcast. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2680.8s)]
*  Jeff, this is horrific. This is horrible to have to report on and discuss. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2684.8s)]
*  And from what we just heard at that press conference, there's no new information or anything they can confirm other than, yeah, both aircraft were on a typical route. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2689.8s)]
*  What do you make of what we're witnessing now and the lack of details this this early in the investigation? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2699.8s)]
*  Well, I'm not surprised by the lack of detail. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2706.8s)]
*  As you said, it's been less than 12 hours and this is a somewhat chaotic situation. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2709.8s)]
*  Something clearly went wrong. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2714.8s)]
*  I would push back against the idea that both of these aircraft were on normal flight routes. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2716.8s)]
*  I mean, they obviously should not have both been at the same place at the same time. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2719.8s)]
*  But it does fit into a pattern of there. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2723.8s)]
*  In recent years, there's been a spate of near misses at U.S. airports. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2725.8s)]
*  This is a safety concern that's been raised. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2728.8s)]
*  And unfortunately, it obviously was not adequately addressed. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2730.8s)]
*  And help us understand previous reports of near misses. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2734.8s)]
*  We've seen it at other airports. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2739.8s)]
*  I'm thinking LaGuardia here in New York, but here in the nation's capital, the Pentagon is right next to this airport. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2740.8s)]
*  In addition to, you know, the federal seat of government. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2746.8s)]
*  Why is it so unusual that this happened? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2752.8s)]
*  Well, there's a number of factors at play here, really. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2756.8s)]
*  One of them, this is an older airport. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2760.8s)]
*  It's quite close into the city center. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2762.8s)]
*  It's small. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2764.8s)]
*  It's right next to the most protected airspace in the world. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2766.8s)]
*  It's also very close to users who have incredible power over the aviation system itself. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2770.8s)]
*  Members of Congress have been lobbying. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2776.8s)]
*  For this airport to carry out more flights, even after the FAA had expressed concern that it was already overloaded. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2779.8s)]
*  And in fact, the flight that was being carried out was was a route that had been added just last year under pressure from a congressman who used it to get home. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2786.8s)]
*  And so this is a classic safety dilemma when you have forces pushing back against increased safety for all of us. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2797.8s)]
*  Whether it's to save money or to increase convenience for powerful people. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2806.8s)]
*  Jeff Wise, stand by for us. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2811.8s)]
*  We want to link up now with CBS News Homeland Security correspondent Nicole Skanga. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2813.8s)]
*  You are at the airport there, DCA, Reagan National. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2818.8s)]
*  This press update just finished behind you, Nicole. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2821.8s)]
*  I'm wondering what stood out to you as far as new information and anything that helps explain how this happened. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2824.8s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely, Errol. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2831.8s)]
*  It was an interesting press conference, certainly a litany of different law enforcement officials along with lawmakers here. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2834.8s)]
*  But perhaps the most fascinating comment coming from the transportation secretary, Sean Duffy. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2842.8s)]
*  It's just his second day on the job here, agreeing with the president of the United States saying this was absolutely preventable. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2847.8s)]
*  Now he was careful not to get into the investigation too much. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2855.8s)]
*  Of course, that will be handed over to the NTSB, the National Transportation Safety Board today. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2859.8s)]
*  And they are beginning that work today and will be on the ground to brief journalists later today. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2864.8s)]
*  But he did say that while it was clear that the helicopter here, that Army Blackhawk, was aware of the plane, it was not clear if the plane was aware of the helicopter. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2871.8s)]
*  That said, he did point to somewhat normal traffic between the airplane and the tower and said that both flight paths of the helicopter and of this plane were standard operating procedure, fairly normal here. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2882.8s)]
*  So again, this raising a little more in the way of questions about what possibly could have been wrong. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2898.8s)]
*  Now, as far as this next phase of the recovery efforts, obviously we are pivoting here from rescue search and rescue to recovery. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2905.8s)]
*  I asked Chief Donnelly, who is in charge of D.C. Fire EMS here on the ground and is lead of the Unified Command, if he is confident that all 67 individuals will be recovered. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2915.8s)]
*  He said yes. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2927.8s)]
*  Right now, they are pouring over three different debris fields and they have, of course, located the fuselage, that main part, main body of the plane, but it is broken up into three pieces. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2928.8s)]
*  And lawmakers I spoke with earlier, as well as law enforcement officials, did stress that it's a bit of a precarious process now. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2941.8s)]
*  This recovery process, I mean, the airplane is submerged in about five to eight feet of water. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2949.8s)]
*  The helicopter inverted upside down. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2957.8s)]
*  So a bit of a precarious process. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2959.8s)]
*  And Donnelly saying that in addition to actually recovering those bodies, there's a process by which the VA, the Virginia Medical Examiner and the Army Medical Examiner need to confirm each individual. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2961.8s)]
*  And so we hope to learn more about some of the victims here. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2975.8s)]
*  We know that there are support services that have been stood up for their family members, that some of them are nearby in a neighboring terminal receiving support from American Airlines and other local services as well. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2978.8s)]
*  That's right, Nicole. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2991.8s)]
*  And we shared a phone number that they delivered at the press conference for relatives of victims who want to find out more. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2992.8s)]
*  And you noted there's a family assistance center there at D.C.A. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=2998.8s)]
*  There is a similar family assistance center in Wichita, Kansas, where the American Airlines flight had departed from last night. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3001.8s)]
*  And I think what will be so confusing to everyone who had a loved one on board or needs to travel and can't get through D.C.A. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3009.8s)]
*  is that according to the officials there, these were standard flight paths. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3017.8s)]
*  An aviation expert we spoke with said it's called the Mount Vernon visual approach from the south toward D.C.A. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3022.8s)]
*  And Chris Van Cleave, our senior transportation correspondent, was saying typically helicopters flying near D.C.A. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3028.8s)]
*  have to lower to about 200 feet or lower when they're flying near the busy airport. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3034.8s)]
*  You add all of that together. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3040.8s)]
*  Plus, what they would and wouldn't say at this press conference in that they don't want to speculate. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3042.8s)]
*  And the fact that this was a military training exercise, it doesn't mean those soldiers on board weren't skilled or able or fully knowledgeable about what to do. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3046.8s)]
*  It does leave you with that major question of how this happened. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3057.8s)]
*  What might be some of the early clues? [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3063.8s)]
*  Well, certainly some questions here regarding communication failures, potentially the fact that the Secretary of Transportation was saying that the helicopter was aware of the plane, [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3069.8s)]
*  but perhaps the plane, unclear if the plane was aware of the helicopter. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3079.8s)]
*  Certainly there will be questions regarding how much air traffic control knew at the time, but nothing really stood out to us in that press conference as an indicator of what might have gone wrong. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3084.8s)]
*  Of course, we do know that that DOD helicopter, that Blackhawk coming from nearby Fort Belvedere in Virginia was on a training mission. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3096.8s)]
*  But the Secretary of Transportation there making it clear that there was no indication that because of that there was some sort of lack of training that would have impeded those helicopter pilots. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3105.8s)]
*  We also heard from the American Airlines CEO who spoke to the experience of the pilots aboard that flight, that regional airline airliner from Wichita, Kansas to Washington, D.C., saying that the pilot there had six years of experience. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3117.8s)]
*  His first officer had two years of experience that there was a team of four on board the plane. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3132.8s)]
*  So of course, a lot of questions here regarding what could have possibly gone wrong. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3138.8s)]
*  I think all of us are scratching our heads this morning asking ourselves, how could a crash have happened just so close to the airport, particularly in Washington, D.C.? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3143.8s)]
*  Which we know, you know, I've been up on helicopters with MPD, with the Department of Energy, with several federal law enforcement agencies here. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3152.8s)]
*  It's a very controlled airspace. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3160.8s)]
*  You know, you can't fly a drone in Washington, D.C. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3163.8s)]
*  It is one of the most meticulously monitored airspaces in the country. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3166.8s)]
*  I will say some of our colleagues from CBS News pressed both the mayor and the transportation secretary on how Americans should feel traveling across the United States. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3172.8s)]
*  And the secretary of transportation, you know, very forcefully said that Americans should feel reassured that the United States still has the safest airspace in the world. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3183.8s)]
*  Yeah, an unprecedented time of aviation safety in the country, some 16 years without a crash now broken by this tragedy. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3195.8s)]
*  Nicole Skanga is giving us the latest there from from D.C.A. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3204.8s)]
*  We appreciate that, Nicole. Thank you so much. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3208.8s)]
*  And for so many of us, Washington correspondents and folks who've been in and out of D.C., this is a place you fly out of frequently. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3211.8s)]
*  It's a very busy airport. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3218.8s)]
*  Let's bring in Jeff Wise, once again, an aviation journalist and host of the Finding MH370 podcast. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3220.8s)]
*  Jeff, what's jumped out to me and what we're learning is the difference in communication at this airport between what the soldiers aboard the military helicopter, how they would have communicated compared to those on board the jet, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3226.8s)]
*  the aircraft broadcasts in VHF, the Black Hawk broadcasts in UHF. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3242.8s)]
*  You better help us understand what that means and why they wouldn't have been in communication with each other. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3247.8s)]
*  I think a really important thing to understand about this crash is that the jet was coming in on a very narrowly defined path. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3254.8s)]
*  It was coming in on a standard route that planes come in every like minute and a half, one after another. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3262.8s)]
*  Boom, boom, boom. They're following a very precise route through the sky and they're doing that under the control of the tower. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3268.8s)]
*  The Black Hawk was not flying that kind of well-defined route. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3275.8s)]
*  It seems pretty clear to me. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3279.8s)]
*  This is very early, so I don't want to speculate. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3281.8s)]
*  But the jet was on a very specific path. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3283.8s)]
*  The Black Hawk was not. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3287.8s)]
*  It seems like the Black Hawk was not where it was supposed to be. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3288.8s)]
*  That's where I would definitely be looking at. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3291.8s)]
*  Yes, they're operating on different frequencies. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3293.8s)]
*  They're talking to the tower. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3296.8s)]
*  They're not talking to each other. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3297.8s)]
*  There has been ATC audio released in which the tower is telling the Black Hawk, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3298.8s)]
*  do you see this plane go around it or behind it? [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3304.8s)]
*  So clearly they're asking the Black Hawk to basically see and avoid. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3308.8s)]
*  They were giving them the responsibility. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3312.8s)]
*  You look for the traffic, you avoid it. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3314.8s)]
*  And obviously that didn't happen. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3316.8s)]
*  And the issue with that question from the control tower to the helicopter, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3318.8s)]
*  make sure you see the aircraft, may have been a point of confusion on the helicopter [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3324.8s)]
*  because this aircraft was coming in on runway 33, I believe, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3330.8s)]
*  which is a newer defined, you say narrowly defined, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3334.8s)]
*  a newer route to accommodate for what is already a very busy and very small airport. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3338.8s)]
*  We don't want to speculate, but we are within the first 12 hours of this happening. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3345.8s)]
*  Does that possibly help explain where some of the confusion may be [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3350.8s)]
*  that they did see an aircraft, but not the one the traffic control tower was warning them about? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3353.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3361.8s)]
*  It's nighttime. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3362.8s)]
*  You've got the lights of the runway off to your right as you're coming south [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3363.8s)]
*  and you see the flashing strobe lights, the navigational lights of the aircraft. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3367.8s)]
*  You can't tell just by looking at it which plane they're talking about. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3373.8s)]
*  And so you might, because so many planes are coming in, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3376.8s)]
*  Yeah, as you say, you might have one aircraft in sight and think it's another one. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3378.8s)]
*  It's stunning to know that it could be as simple as that. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3384.8s)]
*  We're talking about the nation's capital. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3388.8s)]
*  We're talking about the seat of government. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3390.8s)]
*  We're talking about the seat of the military. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3392.8s)]
*  The Pentagon is close to where this just happened. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3396.8s)]
*  And that in the end, we don't know yet, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3398.8s)]
*  and they did not share during the press conference any indication of this, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3401.8s)]
*  but it could have been a visual mix up. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3404.8s)]
*  What type of safeguards are in place to prevent this type of thing? [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3408.8s)]
*  Well, this is highly controlled airspace, very sensitive airspace, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3414.8s)]
*  and it requires training, it requires rules. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3419.8s)]
*  And obviously there has been a slip up. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3422.8s)]
*  Human beings are still an incredibly fallible part of the air traffic control system. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3425.8s)]
*  And people get disoriented, they get confused, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3431.8s)]
*  and this kind of thing happens all the time. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3434.8s)]
*  And it's just a question of making sure your rules, your training, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3437.8s)]
*  are all geared towards preventing it in the future. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3442.8s)]
*  There has to be a revamp. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3445.8s)]
*  People have been sounding the alarm about near misses at airports for years now. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3447.8s)]
*  Clearly it's past due to take those alarms seriously. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3453.8s)]
*  And we're speaking with Jeff Wise. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3459.8s)]
*  We're looking at live pictures of the Potomac River there outside Washington [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3461.8s)]
*  as a recovery effort continues to recover the debris and the victims [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3465.8s)]
*  and their bodies from the crash and a mid-air collision between an American Airlines jet [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3471.8s)]
*  and a Black Hawk military helicopter. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3476.8s)]
*  Jeff, thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3479.8s)]
*  Let's now speak with commercial airline pilot Captain Lauren Einsetler [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3482.8s)]
*  to speak more about this collision and how it may have happened. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3486.8s)]
*  I'm not sure how much you were able to pick up from our previous conversation, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3490.8s)]
*  but there's just a desperate question of how this can happen. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3494.8s)]
*  And it may in the end have been just a visual mix-up. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3497.8s)]
*  I'm wondering, based on the early information we have, what your thoughts are. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3500.8s)]
*  Well, based on the information from the air traffic, the recordings that we've heard, [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3506.8s)]
*  that it sounds like one of the pilots on the Black Hawk helicopter had actually said that [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3512.8s)]
*  at first they did not have the regional jet in sight, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3517.8s)]
*  and the second pilot had clicked on and said, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3521.8s)]
*  yes, they have the regional aircraft in sight, the regional jet, and they had separation, [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3524.8s)]
*  which obviously was not the case. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3530.8s)]
*  So then you have to wonder, okay, did one of those pilots or both in the Black Hawk helicopter [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3532.8s)]
*  assume that they were looking at something when it wasn't actually what they called in sight? [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3539.8s)]
*  Exactly, and that was my early thought as I was just speaking with Jeff Wise, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3545.8s)]
*  because the runway that this American Airlines jet was flying toward, runway 33, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3551.8s)]
*  the plane is on a Mount Vernon visual approach, as we've learned, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3557.8s)]
*  they're heading into runway 33, all of this is typical and routine, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3560.8s)]
*  while the helicopter, typically they are supposed to fly at less than 200 feet, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3565.8s)]
*  that does not appear to be the case here, you have to then look at that communication and that audio, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3570.8s)]
*  and in that audio, as soon as the collision happens, you hear the gasp and the shock among air traffic controllers, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3576.8s)]
*  so obviously a disaster and a tragedy that wasn't intended. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3584.8s)]
*  But further explain how a simple visual mix-up could be the cause of this tragedy. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3589.8s)]
*  Well, Errol, it's very hard sometimes at night, as we all know, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3599.8s)]
*  so when you're driving and let's say you have dark, wet road, for example, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3603.8s)]
*  so from a pilot's perspective, as we're coming in, you see at night, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3609.8s)]
*  you don't have quite the same visual acuity as you do in the daytime, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3614.8s)]
*  so in this case, you have the dark river, you have the airport lighting, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3618.8s)]
*  so with the closure rate and the speed by which both aircrafts were going, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3623.8s)]
*  it's very likely that they just didn't see the movement and that the position lights from the regional jet, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3630.8s)]
*  from the perspective of the Blackhawk pilot, could have been blended in with the airport lighting, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3637.8s)]
*  or even potentially they might have been looking at instead one of the aircrafts that were taking off at that time from runway one. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3644.8s)]
*  Captain Lauren Einstötler, thank you so much for connecting with us [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3653.8s)]
*  and just help us digest what we do and don't know so far on this midair collision. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3656.8s)]
*  We appreciate your time. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3661.8s)]
*  We are looking at live pictures of the Potomac River in Washington this morning. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3662.8s)]
*  A midair collision last night has led to a number of people losing their lives [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3668.8s)]
*  as they continue to try and recover bodies from those cold, frigid waters, [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3673.8s)]
*  a tragedy sending shockwaves throughout the country, especially in the nation's capital. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3677.8s)]

*  There are questions this morning as to how a mid-air collision in the nation's capital, [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3890.8s)]
*  which the Department of Transportation secretary says was completely preventable, happened. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3896.8s)]
*  CBS News congressional correspondent Caitlin Huey-Burns joins us from Reagan National Airport [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3901.8s)]
*  where one aircraft was heading toward before this mid-air collision. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3906.8s)]
*  Caitlin, what do we know at this early stage about what the key focus is to figure out how it happened? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3911.8s)]
*  Well, Errol, what we know now, unfortunately, is that this has moved from a rescue operation to a recovery operation. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3921.8s)]
*  Unfortunately, officials here just a few moments ago said that they don't believe there are any survivors from this crash. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3929.8s)]
*  And so now this will go under the jurisdiction of the NTSB. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3937.8s)]
*  And what that looks like remains to be seen in terms of the timeline. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3942.8s)]
*  But here are a couple of takeaways from this press conference and things that we want to know moving forward. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3947.8s)]
*  I asked officials here just moments ago, can you guarantee that Americans are safe to fly? [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3953.8s)]
*  Remember, this airport is set to open again at 11 just a few hours from now. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3960.8s)]
*  And officials said that they don't have any indications to suggest otherwise. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3965.8s)]
*  We also heard from the new Secretary of Transportation, Sean Duffy, who says that he agrees with President Trump that this could have been prevented. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3970.8s)]
*  So that is kind of the key question for investigators and, quite frankly, for lawmakers on Capitol Hill. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3980.8s)]
*  They're going to have that those same questions as well. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3988.8s)]
*  How could this have been prevented? Now, we are at the DCA airport. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3991.8s)]
*  This is actually technically in Virginia. And you saw members of the Virginia congressional delegation. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=3995.8s)]
*  I'm keeping an eye out for Senator Mark Warner, who said that he will come over and talk to me just in a few moments after he's wrapping up another interview. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4001.8s)]
*  So we have some questions about what congressional oversight is. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4010.8s)]
*  But, Erroll, as you know, on a typical Thursday here in Washington at this particular airport, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4013.8s)]
*  this is usually flooded with lawmakers trying to catch flights home. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4020.8s)]
*  This is a very convenient airport for Washington residents, but also for lawmakers. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4025.8s)]
*  They take flights out of here all the time. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4031.8s)]
*  And they have also raised concerns, senators have, about the congestion at this airport. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4034.8s)]
*  So while we're waiting to hear answers to questions about how this could have happened in the air, [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4040.8s)]
*  you've already had ongoing concerns from lawmakers who have been worried about the amount of flights that take off and land at this airport, given its size. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4046.8s)]
*  So that figures to be a continued line of questioning. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4059.8s)]
*  There's also a role for Congress here. Congress has oversight, particularly of the FAA. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4063.8s)]
*  And what's notable, Erroll, and I apologize if you've noted this already, but the FAA currently does not have an administrator. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4070.8s)]
*  That's a five-year term. It's meant to exceed a president's term so that it's not a political position. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4078.8s)]
*  The person who just occupied it just resigned ahead of his term ending. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4086.8s)]
*  And so there is a vacancy there that also raises some questions about who is having oversight when it comes to safety and everything related to aviation. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4091.8s)]
*  So those are lingering questions that lawmakers are likely to have, but that has also been kind of an ongoing concern, particularly at this airport. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4102.8s)]
*  And, Caitlin, you're accurate to note that while Congress has oversight of this, because personally they fly in and out of this airport every week, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4112.8s)]
*  they have a vested interest to get to the bottom of how such a routine flight for both the chopper and the jet could have resulted in a mid-air collision. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4120.8s)]
*  Certainly, if Senator Werner approaches you, feel free to jump into your Q&A live with us. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4130.8s)]
*  But I do want to add that what they have in their favor at the very least is that they have the air traffic control recording where ATC confirms with the chopper to get a visual confirmation of the jet. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4135.8s)]
*  The chopper confirmed it, and we will eventually have the black box, the data voice and data flight recorder from the jet at some point. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4146.8s)]
*  What then, when that information is gathered, do we expect them to do with it? What could be an outcome here? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4156.8s)]
*  If it was as simple as a miscommunication from ATC to the black hawk chopper. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4163.8s)]
*  Yeah, and that's the biggest question here is what that communication was like, and especially since officials say that this could have been prevented. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4170.8s)]
*  I could also tell you, Errol, that I got to this airport at about two in the morning, and family members of those who we now know are victims of this crash [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4179.8s)]
*  were gathered at the airport waiting and wanting to know a word of their loved ones. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4190.8s)]
*  They were gathered in a, essentially an American Airlines lounge outside of our direct purview, but meeting with lawmakers here. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4198.8s)]
*  And I'm flagging Senator Werner down. He's not. OK. He has to. Apologies for that. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4209.8s)]
*  He has to head to a hearing over on Capitol Hill where no doubt this will be discussed up on Capitol Hill as well. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4216.8s)]
*  But back to those family members, we could see at least through a window family members gathered with officials in essentially a holding room [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4224.8s)]
*  that was the American Airlines lounge here at DCA Airport wanting to know more information. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4237.8s)]
*  I saw one woman enter the arrived at the airport at around three in the morning looking for word for from her friend who she believed to be on that flight, unfortunately. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4244.8s)]
*  And as we know, as we just learned moments ago, there were no survivors believed to have come from this this flight. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4258.8s)]
*  So, again, just to recap, a lot of questions about oversight here, a lot of questions about communication. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4267.8s)]
*  This now will be a very long story with lots and lots of tentacles. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4274.8s)]
*  Errol, of course, top of mind are those family members who have lost loved ones. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4280.8s)]
*  We don't have an official count, as officials said. But of course, that is top of mind. And also how this could happen. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4286.8s)]
*  We heard from the transportation secretary that all of this was very routine, that you have military aircraft operating around DC, around this airport quite frequently. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4294.8s)]
*  You have a landing pattern. This specific flight from Wichita to DCA has been in place for about a year. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4307.8s)]
*  And so that flight pattern has been in existence. So everything, according to officials, looked normal. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4315.8s)]
*  So the question is, how could this have been avoided as they say it should have been? [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4323.8s)]
*  And so many friends of victims, relatives, they are they have the desperate question this morning of what happened. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4329.8s)]
*  How can they know more? And our hearts just go out to to them and all relatives of this tragedy. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4335.8s)]
*  Caitlin Huey Burns joining us live from Reagan National Airport there just outside Washington, DC, in Virginia. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4342.8s)]
*  Caitlin, thank you for more on this response. Let's bring in CBS News White House reporter Aaron Navarro. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4349.8s)]
*  Aaron, what is the latest we're hearing from the president and the White House this morning? [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4354.8s)]
*  Well, we heard Secretary Duffy mentioned that President Trump is expected to be in the situation room at some point this morning. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4359.8s)]
*  We have not seen any further statements from President Trump since last night. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4367.8s)]
*  But I also want to note what Caitlin mentioned earlier that while the recovery efforts remain the priority as the investigation phase of this all begins, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4371.8s)]
*  Secretary Duffy sided with President Trump in saying that this should have been prevented was quote preventable. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4380.8s)]
*  I thought that was notable in that press conference. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4386.8s)]
*  And help us understand the structure because we have the White House saying we're going to look into this. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4389.8s)]
*  You got the Department of Transportation via the secretary there Duffy leading investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board under his purview. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4395.8s)]
*  But you also have the Department of Defense because there was a military chopper involved as well. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4404.8s)]
*  Do we know who is in charge of all those various entities? [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4409.8s)]
*  Yes, certainly a lot of variables. I will take from what we heard at that press conference. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4413.8s)]
*  The Washington, D.C. mayor noted that the National Transportation Safety Board will be leading the investigation. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4418.8s)]
*  I don't hear Secretary Duffy necessarily disagree with that. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4424.8s)]
*  The Defense Department will have their own potentially separate investigation as well, just given that this was a military plane. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4427.8s)]
*  And the role of the White House here is that President Trump will be in the situation room getting all the information as it's coming in. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4433.8s)]
*  It remains to be seen whether he will address the public today. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4441.8s)]
*  But certainly a lot of verified information will come from the White House as well. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4443.8s)]
*  Aaron Navarro giving us the latest there from our D.C. Bureau as we continue to search for details here. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4448.8s)]
*  Aaron, thank you. We now want to bring in Stephen Wallace. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4454.8s)]
*  He's a former director of accident investigation at the FAA. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4457.8s)]
*  And perhaps you can help us understand how the hierarchy coordinates with each other. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4461.8s)]
*  The NTSB, of course, taking the lead. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4466.8s)]
*  But because you have a military helicopter involved, I'm wondering how they coordinate with DOD. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4468.8s)]
*  They will work very cooperatively. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4476.8s)]
*  But the the investigation will be run by the NTSB and they. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4479.8s)]
*  But they will they will invite the parties like I was the head of the accident investigation for the FAA. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4488.8s)]
*  FAA is always a party, particularly here where there will be issues around air traffic control. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4494.8s)]
*  The military will be a party. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4504.8s)]
*  The military may well conduct its own investigation. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4506.8s)]
*  It has its own procedures. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4510.8s)]
*  But this is fundamentally well, it's a combination, obviously, of a civil aircraft and a military aircraft accident. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4513.8s)]
*  But the NTSB will really have the lead as far as the White House. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4522.8s)]
*  I mean, they're not really going to be involved in the nitty gritty of the accident, [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4530.8s)]
*  but they certainly have a role in, you know, speaking, addressing the public concerns and and, you know, the overall system. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4537.8s)]
*  And Stephen, considering your background in all of this, it's 840 in the morning. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4550.8s)]
*  So we're almost about exactly 12 hours after this tragedy unfolded. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4555.8s)]
*  What do you make of the early information, the ATC audio, which seems to show that the control tower confirming with the Black Hawk helicopter to get visual confirmation of the incoming jet? [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4560.8s)]
*  Those on the chopper saying we do see the aircraft and then the collision moments later. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4572.8s)]
*  The fact that this is the Mount Vernon visual approach for the jet, a relatively new route up runway 33. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4578.8s)]
*  What's your early impression based on what we know of how this happened? [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4585.8s)]
*  Well, you know, as a professional in this field, I am not going to speculate as to the cause of the accident. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4591.8s)]
*  But I mean, I can certainly offer observations here and they it was clearly where the controller was relying on the pilot's ability to see and avoid and ask the pilot to be clear that the helicopter had seen the aircraft. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4599.8s)]
*  I think, you know, it's I think there'll be a huge focus on the limitations of kind of the see and avoid, particularly here we are in a nighttime environment with lots of lights and things flying around. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4622.8s)]
*  It is, you know, is just sort of your common sense would tell you, is it possible to think you see the airplane, but you're actually seeing something else? [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4635.8s)]
*  I think there'll be a large focus on whether the the the see and avoid practice is sufficient in all cases. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4646.8s)]
*  And I would point out here that this is the first time that a United States airliner has been in a mid air collision. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4656.8s)]
*  I believe I'm right. Since September of 1978. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4666.8s)]
*  And we're talking about a system that was a PSA mid air collision with the 727 in San Diego. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4671.8s)]
*  And and we're talking about a system that operates the air traffic control system, probably forty five thousand flights in the United States every day. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4678.8s)]
*  And I'm not sure how many of those are airliner flights, maybe twenty eight thousand. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4691.8s)]
*  It depends who you ask. But so this system is incredibly safe. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4696.8s)]
*  Yet, yet what happened happened. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4703.8s)]
*  And so obviously, it's it's not perfect. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4708.8s)]
*  And could it well, you don't want to speculate and we don't want to speculate either. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4713.8s)]
*  But at this early stage, you have relatives of these victims who are desperate to know why this happened. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4718.8s)]
*  Could it be as simple as a visual and verbal miscommunication? [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4724.8s)]
*  I mean, one thing that's always struck me flying in and out of DCA is just how visually mesmerizing it is. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4730.8s)]
*  No matter the time of day, you see the Washington Monument, you see the Capitol Dome as you come in, as you leave. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4737.8s)]
*  There is so much military activity in the form of these choppers carrying VIP around VIPs around sometimes on training missions. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4743.8s)]
*  But could it be as simple as a visual and audio miscommunication? [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4753.8s)]
*  I don't. I don't particularly I don't I don't mean let me say that with, of course, our hearts go out to the families. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4760.8s)]
*  The it's day one of an accident investigation. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4772.8s)]
*  And it's always the case that people are sort of most desperate for information when they have the least amount of information. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4778.8s)]
*  And, you know, what I can say is that the NTSB I worked with for many, many years, they are extremely methodical. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4788.8s)]
*  They are extremely thorough. And all of the evidence they could want will be present here. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4797.8s)]
*  I think you'll find that there are that aircraft. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4803.8s)]
*  The airliner will have had the most sophisticated voice and data recorders that record hundreds of parameters. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4806.8s)]
*  They have radar data. They have audio data. They have eyewitnesses. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4815.8s)]
*  So there's no no shortage of information. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4821.8s)]
*  But the NTSB will very methodically go through every bit of it. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4825.8s)]
*  They won't tell they won't announce the probable cause of this accident typically for for a year or more. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4830.8s)]
*  Oftentimes. Right. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4839.8s)]
*  Right. They'll take the time to speak with everyone involved, get all of the data, the flight data recorder, the voice recorder and issue a very sobering report. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4841.8s)]
*  Every time you see the NTSB reports from incidents like this, there are some surprises sometimes and eye opening remarks. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4851.8s)]
*  Stephen Wallace, thank you for joining us today and giving your early thoughts. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4859.8s)]
*  CBS News senior national security correspondent Charlie Dagata joins us now to help understand how this unfolded. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4864.8s)]
*  Charlie, you're at the Pentagon. What are we learning? [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4872.8s)]
*  Yeah, well, Errol, you know, you hit the nail on the head when you said every time you come into D.C., you see what kind of activity there is. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4876.8s)]
*  You know, it's routine to see military choppers going up and down the Potomac right around Reagan National Airport. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4884.8s)]
*  So as soon as that happened, we were checking with military sources as soon as we heard it was a helicopter. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4890.8s)]
*  We just naturally assumed that the military would have been involved. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4895.8s)]
*  Military officials tell us that the it was an army U.H. 60 Black Hawk helicopter. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4899.8s)]
*  We've reported that before out of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, taking part in a training flight. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4905.8s)]
*  The Fort Belvoir is about 17 miles south of Reagan. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4912.8s)]
*  The Black Hawk belonged to B Company, 12th Aviation Battalion. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4917.8s)]
*  Officials confirmed, as we've reported already, three soldiers on board. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4921.8s)]
*  None of them were senior officials. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4925.8s)]
*  The new defense secretary, Pete Hegsett, said on exit an investigation was launched immediately. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4927.8s)]
*  The army and the Defense Department are cooperating. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4933.8s)]
*  This is being led by the NTSB. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4936.8s)]
*  He also called the incident absolutely tragic. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4939.8s)]
*  You know, as you know, these helicopters are often used to transport military personnel, some cases VIP and other duties around the Washington area. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4943.8s)]
*  And I say that because as part of their training, they would learn how to travel and how to fly and get around in congested airspace and learn the flight patterns near the airport. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4952.8s)]
*  So a law enforcement source close to the investigation has told us that investigators will examine pilot experience in that D.C. airspace. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4963.8s)]
*  And those are the questions that we're asking here. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4972.8s)]
*  We're being told, look, let's wait. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4974.8s)]
*  Let's wait for the NTSB. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4976.8s)]
*  They are driving the investigation and the D.O.D. and the army are doing everything they can to cooperate. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4977.8s)]
*  And as we wait for an official report and official remarks from government sources, I'm wondering what you make of the details that we do know. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4983.8s)]
*  One thing our senior transportation correspondent Chris Van Cleave mentioned moments ago was that on his recent military chopper flights ahead of the inauguration, he witnessed as they had to lower in altitude to I think less than 200 feet when getting near D.C.A. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=4993.8s)]
*  And we heard at the press conference that while this was a training mission, as it's been described, soldiers on board are experienced, they are skilled. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5011.8s)]
*  So what do you make of that? [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5020.8s)]
*  And can you help us understand in layman's terms what it means that they were on a training mission? [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5022.8s)]
*  What is and is is that not? [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5026.8s)]
*  Well, you know, Errol, in layman's terms, almost everything is a training mission. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5028.8s)]
*  I think the reason they're saying it was a training mission is because it wasn't necessarily transporting personnel from one place to another. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5033.8s)]
*  They weren't on an operational mission. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5041.8s)]
*  So it's a training mission, again, not unique. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5043.8s)]
*  If anything, it's routine to see Black Hawk helicopters up and down the Potomac. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5046.8s)]
*  You know, I just moved here about six months ago, and I'm just blown away by the amount of traffic around Reagan National Airport and how low the planes come in right over the Pentagon as they land. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5051.8s)]
*  So that is a congested airspace. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5062.8s)]
*  But, of course, you know, in a manner speaking, they do have their lanes. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5064.8s)]
*  I think what will have to be determined, and this is way out of my pay grade, is whether they were operating within that envelope. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5069.8s)]
*  We know that it's tight. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5077.8s)]
*  Chris Van Cleave knows that it's tight. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5079.8s)]
*  You can see it for yourself. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5081.8s)]
*  We have to determine what went wrong or they have to determine what went wrong. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5083.8s)]
*  And I've been listening to the press conferences this morning and they said, look, the flight path of the helicopter was routine. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5087.8s)]
*  The flight paths were not unusual in the D.C. area, either for the incoming aircraft or for the chopper. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5094.8s)]
*  But clearly something went wrong, and that's what they'll have to determine here. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5102.8s)]
*  In terms of experience, they would, well, the Army would argue that the pilots and that crew would not have been flying in that area if they lacked the experience. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5106.8s)]
*  So I guess what I'm trying to say here is let's not necessarily confuse a training mission with sort of newcomers or individuals that weren't capable of flying within that airspace. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5115.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly what I wanted you to drill down on. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5127.8s)]
*  We are getting some early information, early information that the NTSB, which we've discussed is leading this investigation, [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5131.8s)]
*  may deliver their first press conference to the public at about 2 p.m. this afternoon. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5139.8s)]
*  This incident happening approximately 12 hours ago from this moment. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5146.8s)]
*  Charlie, what is the physical posturing around the airport? [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5151.8s)]
*  We know it's close to incoming outgoing traffic until at least 11 a.m. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5157.8s)]
*  That may get pushed back. What more can you tell us? [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5161.8s)]
*  OK, well, so as soon as this happened last night, in addition to contacting our sources here at the Pentagon, I'm only about 15 minutes away from the airport. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5164.8s)]
*  So I made a beeline for the airport to the Potomac. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5173.8s)]
*  Obviously, all the roads leading to the airport were closed off. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5176.8s)]
*  And you may have seen some of our coverage at Tony DeCople on the other side of the Potomac. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5179.8s)]
*  That was as close as we could get. It was a clear night, very cold. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5184.8s)]
*  In fact, the Potomac had been frozen over for a number of weeks leading up to this, and there is still ice there. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5187.8s)]
*  It gives you an idea of how cold it is and was. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5193.8s)]
*  Then, while we were there, it seemed that the helicopters, specifically the helicopters, were broadening their search area. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5196.8s)]
*  And I think that's what Tony was referring to earlier, the reason that they were moved off that area, because, you know, it's probably a mile or two across. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5205.8s)]
*  And what I saw, and you could see this in the darkness of night, there seemed to be three very distinct debris fields. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5213.8s)]
*  One in particular to the right from where I was looking, which is furthest away from the airport, where there's a lot of emergency vehicles there. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5222.8s)]
*  Again, divers. There's a lot of illumination to help with the search. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5229.8s)]
*  At one point, by the way, last night, they asked us to turn off our lights because it was getting in the way of their night vision and their searches. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5235.8s)]
*  So if anything, that that area of debris that they had been searching has been widened across the river and including the marina, which is where most of the television crews had set up. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5243.8s)]
*  And we did hear during the press conference a short time ago that the fuselage is in three distinct sections there. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5254.8s)]
*  It has now moved on to a recovery mission. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5260.8s)]
*  Charlie Daggett are giving us the latest from the Pentagon. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5263.8s)]
*  Charlie, we will surely continue to connect with you throughout the day. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5266.8s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5270.8s)]
*  Let's now speak with Linda Tran. She's a former senior adviser to then Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5271.8s)]
*  It's a day of tragedy, Linda. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5278.8s)]
*  I just want to get your early impressions of what we're all witnessing. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5280.8s)]
*  Well, I mean, first off, Errol, it's so sad, obviously, and I really appreciate the chance to be with you all. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5284.8s)]
*  I mean, some of the things to think about often, you know, you hear about the FAA being set in its ways. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5290.8s)]
*  You're witnessing right now exactly why that is. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5296.8s)]
*  If you think about it, the tenure of the officials, the career officials at the FAA is on average 16 years. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5299.8s)]
*  That's long enough to remember the Colgan air crash that happened in 2009. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5305.8s)]
*  And there are people that have been there 30, 40, 50 years who remember the legacy of TWA. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5309.8s)]
*  So all that is to say the Federal Civil Service takes this type of scenario, the potential for extremely seriously. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5314.8s)]
*  And that is why you see them working so hard on a daily basis. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5321.8s)]
*  At this juncture, you're seeing a lot of information coming at us fast and furiously. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5324.8s)]
*  I just want to stress that it is far too early to figure out who is to blame and what is to blame. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5329.8s)]
*  And you have seen as of this morning the handoff between DOT and the FAA to NTSB, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5334.8s)]
*  which is an independent organization that is designed exactly for this to take a deep look, to do forensic analysis of the digital trail, [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5339.8s)]
*  whether it's the cockpit reporter or the communications that have happened between those aircraft and the air traffic control tower and what was happening across the agency. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5347.8s)]
*  They will make their recommendations based on the actual data and what they're able to see. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5356.8s)]
*  Great points made all around there. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5361.8s)]
*  So what should we be looking to as we continue to analyze every aspect of this? [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5364.8s)]
*  As I just reported, we may hear from the NTSB, which is leading this probe at 2 p.m. this afternoon. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5371.8s)]
*  But in the meantime, you've got all these relatives of victims devastated, desperately trying to get in contact with the airline, get to the location. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5377.8s)]
*  And they too will be demanding answers in addition to Congress, people who fly in and out of this airport every day. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5386.8s)]
*  So where should we all be focusing our attention? [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5391.8s)]
*  Absolutely, Errol. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5395.8s)]
*  I mean, unfortunately, the main message here is not to jump to conclusions and unfortunately to preach some patience, [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5397.8s)]
*  because what we don't want to do is to have any big sweeping statements about what exactly happened before all of the data are available. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5403.8s)]
*  My understanding is the airline and the facility itself has been trying to keep in close contact with the various victims, [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5411.8s)]
*  family members to make sure that they have live and relevant information as it comes in. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5420.8s)]
*  But honestly, it's just a tough, tough situation. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5425.8s)]
*  It's the last thing anybody wants to see. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5427.8s)]
*  And it's again part of the reason why there is so much concern about the sort of standard operating procedures and what the FAA has underway. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5430.8s)]
*  And just in the last minute with you, what was what went through your mind? [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5438.8s)]
*  What was your reaction when you first heard of this? [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5442.8s)]
*  I mean, look, Errol, DCA is a very, very different airport than all of the others in the country. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5445.8s)]
*  It has older infrastructure, incredibly short runways. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5451.8s)]
*  In fact, when you think about how the airspace is restricted around this airport, [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5455.8s)]
*  it's actually amazing that on a regular basis, so many aircraft can get in and out of there safely. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5461.8s)]
*  My heart goes out to the family members. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5466.8s)]
*  And we do want to repeat that phone number 1-800-679-8215 for relatives of victims. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5469.8s)]
*  That's been provided to help you all get the information you need. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5476.8s)]
*  And there's a family assistance center both at DCA and at the airport in Wichita, Kansas, [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5480.8s)]
*  as well as a physical staging area for relatives of victims. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5485.8s)]
*  Linda Tran, thank you so much for joining us on this breaking news event. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5490.8s)]

*  I see conditions there, a recovery mission underway after more than 60 people, [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5499.8s)]
*  both passengers on a jet, crew and soldiers on a Black Hawk helicopter, [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5505.8s)]
*  all died after a mid-air collision right next to the nation's capital [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5510.8s)]
*  on what was, according to the Transportation Secretary, a completely preventable disaster. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5516.8s)]

*  with the military helicopter. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5819.6s)]
*  It is the first aviation disaster [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5821.16s)]
*  in the United States in 16 years. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5823.360000000001s)]
*  Crews continue to search the wreckage at this hour [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5825.9400000000005s)]
*  in the Potomac River. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5828.2s)]
*  But it's no longer a rescue mission. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5829.4400000000005s)]
*  Tragically, sadly, officials believe [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5831.68s)]
*  that there are no survivors. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5833.82s)]
*  67 people now lost to the people who love them. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5835.68s)]
*  Here's what we know about how this happened. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5839.52s)]
*  Just before nine o'clock last night, [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5841.68s)]
*  that American Airlines flight [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5843.360000000001s)]
*  was making its final approach to the airport. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5844.56s)]
*  That's when it collided with an Army Black Hawk helicopter [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5847.32s)]
*  on a training mission about 300 feet above the ground. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5850.28s)]
*  The moment of impact, a fireball was captured on camera [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5853.74s)]
*  in the sky over the Potomac River, and there you see it. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5857.04s)]
*  Also happening right now, an investigation is underway [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5860.2s)]
*  led by the NTSB and of course, a grim mission [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5863.0s)]
*  for forced responders in brutally cold conditions, [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5866.679999999999s)]
*  pulling bodies from the water. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5869.5599999999995s)]
*  So far, at least 27 people have been recovered [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5871.46s)]
*  from the American Airlines flight [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5874.04s)]
*  and one from the helicopter. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5875.68s)]
*  Nicole Skanga is at Reagan National Airport [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5877.68s)]
*  and she's been following this very closely. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5879.9400000000005s)]
*  Nicole, good morning. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5882.4400000000005s)]
*  What's the latest that you're learning? [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5883.62s)]
*  Good morning, good to be with you. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5887.200000000001s)]
*  And we just learned a number of things [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5888.68s)]
*  from officials there during that press briefing. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5890.4800000000005s)]
*  First, Transportation Secretary, Sean Duffy, [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5893.160000000001s)]
*  it's his second day on the job here, [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5896.08s)]
*  stressing that both the helicopter and the plane [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5897.96s)]
*  involved in this tragic crash [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5901.280000000001s)]
*  had been on normal flight patterns. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5903.28s)]
*  This was not unusual, he stressed to us. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5905.76s)]
*  And as you noted, this morning, [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5908.5199999999995s)]
*  the operation actually switched from a search [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5910.36s)]
*  and recovery effort to a full-on recovery operation, [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5912.76s)]
*  from search and rescue to recovery here. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5917.2s)]
*  We're also learning a little bit more [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5919.84s)]
*  about some of the individuals who were on this plane. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5921.96s)]
*  A number of figure skaters, their coaches, [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5924.98s)]
*  as well as their families, and actually in a statement, [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5927.84s)]
*  U.S. figure skating said, quote, [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5930.84s)]
*  "'We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy, [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5932.76s)]
*  and we hold the victims and families closely in our hearts.'" [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5935.96s)]
*  Now, the airport has been closed overnight [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5939.96s)]
*  with a number of flights here that were grounded. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5942.4800000000005s)]
*  In addition, a number of flights not able to land, [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5946.12s)]
*  19 diverted to nearby Dulles Airport. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5949.56s)]
*  But officials are starting to ready [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5952.24s)]
*  Reagan International Airport to reopen [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5955.24s)]
*  in just a couple of hours, [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5957.88s)]
*  with the American authorities saying it is safe to fly. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5959.36s)]
*  Nicole, thank you so much. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5967.28s)]
*  We are also about to hear from officials in Wichita, Kansas, [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5969.08s)]
*  where that American Airlines flight took off from yesterday. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5971.799999999999s)]
*  This is a live news briefing. Let's listen in. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5974.44s)]
*  And we will share those details and confirmed information [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5979.08s)]
*  when we receive that. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5983.5599999999995s)]
*  I want to first thank also the first responders [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5986.32s)]
*  in Washington, D.C., who have worked tirelessly [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5989.88s)]
*  throughout the night, and at this time, [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5993.5599999999995s)]
*  we have been told that there are no survivors. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=5997.16s)]
*  We mourn with all those who have been impacted. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6006.759999999999s)]
*  This is a terrible tragedy that will unite those in Washington, [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6011.56s)]
*  D.C. and Wichita, Kansas, forever. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6018.360000000001s)]
*  As we know, an American Airlines jet carrying 64 people [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6023.96s)]
*  plunged into the Potomac River after colliding in midair [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6029.200000000001s)]
*  with an Army helicopter on Wednesday night. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6033.84s)]
*  We're hearing recovery teams in Washington, D.C. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6037.08s)]
*  had pulled more than two dozen bodies from the icy waters. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6040.16s)]
*  We do not know yet final confirmation [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6045.64s)]
*  on all of the individuals who were on that flight, [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6048.04s)]
*  and of course, we will share that information, [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6051.72s)]
*  but not before families have been first contacted. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6055.2s)]
*  Congressman Ron Estes is here with us this morning [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6061.16s)]
*  and I would like to invite him to say a few words. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6064.48s)]
*  Well, thank you, Mayor Wu, and thank you [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6071.5599999999995s)]
*  for all of the City Council members [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6073.5599999999995s)]
*  for holding this press conference [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6075.16s)]
*  to help share this information. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6076.879999999999s)]
*  This is such a tragic day for our community. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6078.799999999999s)]
*  So many of us will be touched by people [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6082.04s)]
*  that we know directly or indirectly [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6084.12s)]
*  that were victims of this tragic tragedy that happened. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6086.28s)]
*  You know, I'm not going to say that this is a tragic day, [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6090.879999999999s)]
*  you know, overnight I was in contact [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6094.280000000001s)]
*  with the White House Situation Room, [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6097.320000000001s)]
*  getting updates as they were going through the process. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6099.8s)]
*  Spoke last night with the Chairwoman [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6102.76s)]
*  of the National Transportation Safety Board as well. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6105.200000000001s)]
*  And at that point in time, their investigation was, [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6108.160000000001s)]
*  they were getting prepared for that, [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6113.52s)]
*  but they were waiting for the search and rescue efforts [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6115.360000000001s)]
*  to conclude before they started that investigation. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6117.360000000001s)]
*  So I know this is going to be a tragedy [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6121.64s)]
*  that touches our community. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6123.68s)]
*  We have such a steep history of being involved in aviation [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6125.4800000000005s)]
*  and being a close-knit community like we are, [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6131.400000000001s)]
*  it's going to have consequences for years to come. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6134.76s)]
*  I do want to make a general comment [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6138.72s)]
*  about air safety in general. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6141.68s)]
*  I mean, we have the safest skies [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6143.400000000001s)]
*  in any country in the world. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6145.280000000001s)]
*  And when a tragic incident like this happens, [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6147.08s)]
*  obviously we want to do the investigation, [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6151.12s)]
*  which will take days and weeks to go through that process [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6153.2s)]
*  and to make sure that we can prevent accidents like this [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6156.64s)]
*  from happening in the future. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6159.88s)]
*  And so I appreciate all of the updates [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6161.12s)]
*  we'll have this morning. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6164.400000000001s)]
*  I know there'll be more coming out, [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6165.24s)]
*  both from here in Wichita as well as in DC. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6167.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6172.6s)]
*  Thank you very much, Congressman. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6176.6s)]
*  We also have a representative for Senator Jerry Moran [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6178.76s)]
*  who will share a statement as well. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6182.12s)]
*  Mayor, thank you. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6188.400000000001s)]
*  Mike Zamberslow with United States [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6189.6s)]
*  Senator Jerry Moran's office. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6191.64s)]
*  The Senator asked me to share the following statement [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6193.84s)]
*  on his behalf. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6197.360000000001s)]
*  Wichita is located in the heart of our nation. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6199.76s)]
*  And today we are grieving. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6202.96s)]
*  I received confirmation this morning [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6205.56s)]
*  that no one survived the crash [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6207.88s)]
*  of American Airlines flight 5342. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6211.12s)]
*  This is a sad day for Kansans and our nation. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6214.64s)]
*  As we awaken this morning to this tragic news, [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6219.4400000000005s)]
*  my heart grieves for the lives that were lost [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6223.56s)]
*  and their loved ones who are now learning [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6226.28s)]
*  that their friend or family member [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6229.2s)]
*  was among those who perished. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6230.96s)]
*  There will be much to learn and to do in the coming days [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6233.64s)]
*  in the wake of this tragedy. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6236.68s)]
*  But today, please join me in praying for Kansas. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6238.56s)]
*  May God comfort those who are mourning. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6242.64s)]
*  Mayor, thank you. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6245.4400000000005s)]
*  I would like to now ask our airports director, [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6249.6s)]
*  Jesse Romo, to provide some updates. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6252.76s)]
*  And again, a lot of the details [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6255.8s)]
*  are still waiting for confirmation. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6258.4400000000005s)]
*  And so we ask that Jesse give us the latest [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6260.72s)]
*  that we have confirmed. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6264.4400000000005s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6266.68s)]
*  Thank you, Mayor. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6270.84s)]
*  Good morning, everyone. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6271.68s)]
*  Jesse Romo, Director of Airports [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6272.72s)]
*  with the Tower Board Authority. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6274.08s)]
*  I don't have a lot of official information to share. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6276.4400000000005s)]
*  We will get that directly from NTSB. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6279.4800000000005s)]
*  American Airlines will be providing [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6282.84s)]
*  the official updates and information. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6284.72s)]
*  They do have a newsroom that you can go to online. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6287.04s)]
*  The website is aaa.com slash newsroom. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6290.96s)]
*  There's also an 800 number to utilize [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6296.0s)]
*  for the friends and family members [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6299.04s)]
*  of the People of War of the Flight, 1-800-679-8215. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6301.64s)]
*  I will say that airport staff did activate [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6310.12s)]
*  our family instance support team last night. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6312.36s)]
*  And so if family members did show up to the terminal [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6315.16s)]
*  to have additional information, even for support, [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6318.16s)]
*  we were there with them, with our team of volunteers, [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6322.24s)]
*  along with other airline staff and representatives. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6326.32s)]
*  The airport remains open. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6329.4s)]
*  There is air traffic continuing. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6331.88s)]
*  Right now we do have fog, so I would ask everybody [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6335.0s)]
*  to please drive safe as you're headed to the airport [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6338.76s)]
*  or are traveling today and keep up with your airline [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6341.44s)]
*  for additional information. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6344.36s)]
*  All right, you've been listening to a news conference [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6346.92s)]
*  in Wichita, Kansas about that deadly midair collision [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6349.12s)]
*  that happened last night. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6352.4s)]
*  You heard there from the mayor, Lily Wu, [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6353.28s)]
*  along with Representative Ron Estes. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6355.12s)]
*  And it was reiterated, Adriana, how safe America is [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6357.44s)]
*  when it comes to air travel. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6361.76s)]
*  So people should understand that. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6363.84s)]
*  I know Tony is near though, the scene of the crash [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6365.28s)]
*  near Reagan National Airport. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6367.88s)]
*  Tony, what are you learning this morning? [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6369.48s)]
*  Hey, Vlad, good morning. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6373.68s)]
*  A little trouble hearing you. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6374.599999999999s)]
*  We've been reset again. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6375.44s)]
*  We were on the Potomac early this morning. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6377.360000000001s)]
*  Viewers of our 7 a.m. broadcast on the East Coast [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6380.280000000001s)]
*  will recall, and then we were inside [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6382.320000000001s)]
*  at the press conference. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6383.6s)]
*  Now we've made our way to a vantage point [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6384.72s)]
*  where you can see the control tower [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6386.280000000001s)]
*  from Reagan National Airport, [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6387.68s)]
*  where those crucial audio message originated [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6389.160000000001s)]
*  in an attempt to communicate with the helicopter [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6391.96s)]
*  and the airliner, the collision not prevented, of course. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6394.280000000001s)]
*  One of the questions we've all had this morning, [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6397.080000000001s)]
*  it's come up in the press conferences, [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6399.120000000001s)]
*  we've been thinking about it as well, [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6400.4400000000005s)]
*  is what was going on aboard that Army helicopter, [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6402.160000000001s)]
*  that UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter that we understand [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6405.28s)]
*  originated from Langley, CIA headquarters. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6409.679999999999s)]
*  Charlie Daggett is our Pentagon correspondent, [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6413.4s)]
*  and I believe we have him on the line. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6415.32s)]
*  He's been looking into this side of the story. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6416.88s)]
*  Charlie, good morning. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6418.96s)]
*  Yeah, good morning, Tony. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6421.12s)]
*  As soon as we heard about this last night, [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6423.04s)]
*  the first thing we did was call officials [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6425.2s)]
*  here at the Pentagon. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6427.32s)]
*  We just assumed it was a military helicopter [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6428.88s)]
*  that was involved. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6431.28s)]
*  You said it yourself. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6432.12s)]
*  You can see the amount of traffic. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6433.24s)]
*  It's a very congested area. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6435.76s)]
*  The Army tells us, and these are the facts so far, [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6437.44s)]
*  and by the way, we're expecting a press conference [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6440.24s)]
*  with the defense secretary, [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6443.76s)]
*  the new defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6445.0s)]
*  within the next 20 minutes or so. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6448.96s)]
*  The Black Hawk belonged to B Company, [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6451.24s)]
*  12th Aviation Battalion. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6453.44s)]
*  Officials confirmed, as we've been reporting, [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6455.5199999999995s)]
*  three people on board. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6457.16s)]
*  There were no senior officials, [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6458.24s)]
*  and I mention that because sometimes these helicopters [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6459.56s)]
*  are tasked with getting senior defense officials [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6463.0s)]
*  up and down and across the D.C. area, [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6466.04s)]
*  which is why, I know it's been described as routine. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6469.88s)]
*  It is routine. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6472.36s)]
*  It's a very close, congested area, [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6473.76s)]
*  but it is routine to see these Black Hawk helicopters [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6476.52s)]
*  up and down that area near the airport. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6479.08s)]
*  As I said, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6482.16s)]
*  last night said an investigation was launched immediately [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6484.28s)]
*  using the Army and the Defense Department, [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6488.92s)]
*  although this is driven by the NTSB. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6491.0s)]
*  He called the incident absolutely tragic. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6493.4s)]
*  The helicopters, as I said, [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6496.48s)]
*  they can be used to take military personnel [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6497.92s)]
*  around the D.C. area, and as part of their training, [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6500.8s)]
*  they need to travel in the congested airspace. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6503.8s)]
*  You know, Charlie, we had a conversation earlier [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6508.16s)]
*  with a veteran Black Hawk helicopter pilot, [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6510.04s)]
*  a former battalion leader, a lieutenant colonel, [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6512.92s)]
*  who told us that one of the questions he would have [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6515.92s)]
*  is whether the pilots of this aircraft [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6518.16s)]
*  had night vision goggles on or not in this training mission. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6521.8s)]
*  He said without the goggles, [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6524.96s)]
*  they'd have a pretty good range of vision. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6526.12s)]
*  The Black Hawk is actually pretty good for visibility, [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6528.08s)]
*  and they'd have people assigned to looking out, [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6530.32s)]
*  but with the goggles on, [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6532.92s)]
*  it would radically change their field of visibility. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6534.44s)]
*  Do you have any insight on that front? [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6536.72s)]
*  Not yet, and that's one of the questions [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6539.639999999999s)]
*  that we've been asking, [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6541.16s)]
*  and I think one of the reasons [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6542.2s)]
*  they're probably trying to control the message [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6543.599999999999s)]
*  is they don't want to get ahead of the defense secretary. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6545.5199999999995s)]
*  I also have to point out here, [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6548.28s)]
*  we will be asking the questions. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6550.2s)]
*  You know, training mission doesn't necessarily mean [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6551.959999999999s)]
*  that you're dealing with an inexperienced crew. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6554.5599999999995s)]
*  Logic would state that you wouldn't have an inexperienced crew [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6557.839999999999s)]
*  in that area around the airport [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6560.919999999999s)]
*  for reasons that we've already discussed. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6563.639999999999s)]
*  So it will come down to what they were using, [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6565.879999999999s)]
*  what they were equipped with, their experience. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6569.12s)]
*  Those are the questions we'll be putting [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6572.32s)]
*  to the defense secretary later, [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6573.56s)]
*  but again, the officials that we've spoken to [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6575.72s)]
*  sort of drill down, yes, it was a training mission. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6578.76s)]
*  In a manner of speaking, many missions are, [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6581.64s)]
*  unless you're transporting one person [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6584.120000000001s)]
*  from one area to another, they could be described as that, [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6586.92s)]
*  but that doesn't necessarily mean [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6589.400000000001s)]
*  that there was a lack of experience among this flight crew. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6591.96s)]
*  Absolutely, and training mission doesn't mean, [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6596.04s)]
*  and it was an unimportant mission either, [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6599.0s)]
*  there was a purpose, it was on the docket for a reason, [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6601.04s)]
*  but it was a training mission. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6604.4s)]
*  So that's the question. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6605.799999999999s)]
*  Charlie Daggett, thank you very much. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6606.759999999999s)]
*  Vlad and Adriana, as I throw it back to you, [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6608.5599999999995s)]
*  I am reminded and struck by a comment from Robert Eisen, [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6611.0s)]
*  the CEO of American Airlines, [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6613.959999999999s)]
*  as we just hear Charlie's reporting at this initial stage [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6615.5599999999995s)]
*  on the Army side of things. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6618.2s)]
*  The CEO of American Airlines said that the Army helicopter [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6619.959999999999s)]
*  quote, came into the path of the commercial airliner. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6624.44s)]
*  So the perspective from American at this hour is, [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6627.719999999999s)]
*  is it the helicopter that's coming from their trajectory [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6630.6s)]
*  that caused this accident? [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6633.120000000001s)]
*  That's the statement from the press conference [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6634.280000000001s)]
*  just a few moments ago. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6636.360000000001s)]
*  Of course, we're gonna keep following it [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6637.200000000001s)]
*  as I send it back to you guys in New York. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6638.4400000000005s)]
*  So much to piece together, Tony, thank you so much. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6640.400000000001s)]
*  In the final moments before the collision, [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6643.360000000001s)]
*  air traffic control recordings show that the controller [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6644.96s)]
*  on duty asked the chopper if it could see the airliner, [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6647.4800000000005s)]
*  and the answer was yes. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6651.040000000001s)]
*  So why did they collide? [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6653.0s)]
*  Let's talk about this with Paul Rinaldi, [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6654.320000000001s)]
*  former president of the National Air Traffic [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6656.280000000001s)]
*  which is their labor union. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6658.88s)]
*  Good morning, Paul. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6660.160000000001s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6661.0s)]
*  Let's dive right in. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6662.280000000001s)]
*  Let's talk about this area, Washington DC. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6663.200000000001s)]
*  I've lived there in the past, [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6665.76s)]
*  and one of the first things you notice when you move there [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6667.04s)]
*  is all of the sound of the helicopters [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6669.4400000000005s)]
*  because of the activity, because of the nearby bases [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6671.0s)]
*  and high level officials traveling. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6673.240000000001s)]
*  Give us a lay of the land [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6675.68s)]
*  from the air traffic controller's perspective [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6676.68s)]
*  of how busy and dangerous, or not dangerous in general, [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6678.88s)]
*  this airspace is. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6681.92s)]
*  So the airspace around Washington National Airport [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6683.84s)]
*  is tremendously busy and complex. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6686.68s)]
*  The controls do an outstanding job day in and day out, [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6690.12s)]
*  but unfortunately it's a profession [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6694.08s)]
*  where you have to be 100%, 100% of the time. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6695.52s)]
*  Now we don't know exactly what happened last night, [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6698.240000000001s)]
*  and I heard some say this is kind of routine [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6701.4800000000005s)]
*  to have the helicopters there. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6704.76s)]
*  It is. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6706.08s)]
*  It was a clear night. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6707.4400000000005s)]
*  Communication with air traffic control, [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6709.16s)]
*  we just have to wait for the NTSB, DOD, and the experts [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6711.200000000001s)]
*  to try to figure out the root causes. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6715.36s)]
*  There's usually, I would say, more than one cause. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6718.48s)]
*  It's usually a chain of events that lead up to this. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6723.88s)]
*  So Paul, let me ask you about this. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6727.08s)]
*  People were probably wondering, [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6728.92s)]
*  when it comes to a military aircraft [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6730.5599999999995s)]
*  and a civilian aircraft, [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6732.2s)]
*  is the military aircraft under the same advisories [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6733.5599999999995s)]
*  that are issued by air traffic control? [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6736.92s)]
*  Are they listening and hearing and taking guidance [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6739.0s)]
*  from civilian air traffic control? [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6741.679999999999s)]
*  Yes, they are. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6744.24s)]
*  If they're in an airspace that's being worked [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6745.92s)]
*  by FAA controllers, they're talking to FAA controllers, [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6747.24s)]
*  and there's constant communication going on. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6750.28s)]
*  Part of the communication we understand [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6753.72s)]
*  is that the air traffic controller said to the helicopter, [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6755.44s)]
*  do you see the plane, the American Airlines plane, [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6759.48s)]
*  and the answer was yes, affirmative, we see the plane. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6762.28s)]
*  And then there's silence before the collision, [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6765.0s)]
*  according to our understanding. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6768.2s)]
*  Why would that be the case? [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6770.48s)]
*  Wouldn't the air traffic controller be able to see [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6771.6s)]
*  on the monitors that these are about to collide? [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6774.12s)]
*  Why wasn't there a call to abort? [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6775.96s)]
*  The air traffic controller probably on their display [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6779.88s)]
*  got something called the CA, a conflict alert, [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6782.08s)]
*  then issued a warning. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6784.84s)]
*  Do you have that aircraft in sight? [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6787.28s)]
*  The helicopter said yes. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6789.5599999999995s)]
*  We don't know what happened in the cockpit [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6791.76s)]
*  of either aircraft. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6793.5199999999995s)]
*  That's why we have to wait for the experts to investigate [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6794.84s)]
*  and really get to the root cause of how this happened [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6798.5199999999995s)]
*  and make sure it never happens again. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6801.64s)]
*  And at this altitude, we understand that the helicopter [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6803.56s)]
*  was flying around 300 feet. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6806.6s)]
*  We're told that then visual separation takes place. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6809.320000000001s)]
*  I guess that's where the pilot on the helicopter [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6813.72s)]
*  uses visual cues to see other aircraft in the area. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6816.84s)]
*  Could you tell us a little bit about that process [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6820.92s)]
*  and if there could be a possible confusion at night? [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6823.280000000001s)]
*  So VFR, visual separation rules, [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6828.320000000001s)]
*  is when it's more than three miles visibility [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6831.76s)]
*  and higher than a thousand feet ceiling for the cloud base. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6834.4400000000005s)]
*  Last night it was clear there was great visibility. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6839.280000000001s)]
*  So we use visual separation rules with helicopters [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6843.320000000001s)]
*  for sure in this area because you can't go [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6848.76s)]
*  to standard separation rules [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6851.24s)]
*  because there's just not enough room. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6852.88s)]
*  The airspace is so tight. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6854.52s)]
*  You have corridors where the helicopters need to be. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6856.04s)]
*  You also have prohibited areas that you have to avoid. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6859.48s)]
*  Obviously the sensitive areas in Washington, D.C. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6862.36s)]
*  and the Pentagon. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6865.799999999999s)]
*  So it's really, it's a narrow path that the pilots [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6867.04s)]
*  and the helicopters have to, of both the helicopters [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6870.679999999999s)]
*  and the aircraft need to fly. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6873.44s)]
*  It's very complex. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6874.639999999999s)]
*  And I don't wanna say it's routine [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6878.0s)]
*  because something tragically went wrong last night, [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6879.959999999999s)]
*  but for the most part, this happens hundreds of times a day [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6882.679999999999s)]
*  that the controls are communicating with helicopters [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6885.5599999999995s)]
*  and aircraft as they're on approach and departing from DCA. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6887.88s)]
*  Paul Rinaldi, we are so grateful to have your perspective. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6892.24s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6894.6s)]
*  Unfortunately, this is a horrible night [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6897.16s)]
*  for aviation in this country and we've gotta make it safer. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6899.76s)]
*  It's horrific. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6903.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6903.84s)]
*  All right, we will have much more on the search [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6904.66s)]
*  for the victims of the midair collision [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6906.32s)]
*  and the investigation into what went wrong. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6908.04s)]
*  But first it's time to check your local weather. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=6910.52s)]

*  What is at stake here? [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7549.92s)]
*  What is the answer to that? [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7551.04s)]
*  Do you know why? [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7552.04s)]
*  You want me to just keep going? [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7553.36s)]
*  Is that a good thing or a bad thing? [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7554.52s)]
*  Were there death threats? [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7555.6s)]
*  How is this possible? [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7556.76s)]
*  What's wrong with that, Art? [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7557.76s)]
*  Are you saying they lied? [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7558.76s)]
*  Have you told the government that? [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7559.6s)]
*  Why won't you say the word crisis? [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7560.96s)]
*  You're not answering my question. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7562.36s)]
*  This really is. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7563.44s)]

*  We're back on CBS mornings on what on any other day [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7597.46s)]
*  would be an absolutely stunning and beautiful sunrise [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7603.62s)]
*  over the Potomac River. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7606.96s)]
*  But this morning is first light on a tragedy [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7607.94s)]
*  over the Potomac. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7610.759999999999s)]
*  The collision of an American Airlines commercial flight [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7611.94s)]
*  with 64 people on board with an army Black Hawk helicopter [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7614.66s)]
*  with three soldiers on board. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7618.62s)]
*  This morning has been about finding out what happened. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7620.3s)]
*  A series of press conferences, [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7622.9s)]
*  the latest that we're waiting on right now as we speak [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7624.3s)]
*  is with Pete Hegseth, the new Secretary of Defense. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7627.46s)]
*  We want to hear the army side of what happened here. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7630.58s)]
*  We've already heard from the American Airlines personnel, [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7632.9400000000005s)]
*  NTSB first responders at an earlier press conference. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7637.38s)]
*  The White House of course is also monitoring all this [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7640.62s)]
*  and it's where we find our Ed O'Keefe. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7643.18s)]
*  Ed, good morning. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7645.54s)]
*  What are you hearing over there? [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7646.38s)]
*  Well, Tony, good morning. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7649.1s)]
*  This deadly tragedy happened just about [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7650.06s)]
*  four and a half miles south of where we are here [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7651.900000000001s)]
*  at the White House and it's the first major incident [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7653.94s)]
*  and test for the new Trump administration. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7656.139999999999s)]
*  The president said last night in a formal statement [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7658.5s)]
*  that he had been fully briefed on the situation [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7661.299999999999s)]
*  and thanked the first responders. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7664.299999999999s)]
*  But he then took to his own social media platform [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7665.74s)]
*  calling the collision quote, a bad situation [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7668.38s)]
*  that looks like it should have been prevented. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7671.08s)]
*  The National Security Advisor, Michael Walstead, [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7673.86s)]
*  reporters over here a little while ago. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7675.7s)]
*  The ongoing response in the Potomac River [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7677.58s)]
*  officially became a recovery mission around 4 a.m. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7679.48s)]
*  Federal officials involved with the response tell CBS News [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7684.38s)]
*  they're eager not only to get the basic information answered [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7686.9s)]
*  like how fast was the plane traveling, [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7689.34s)]
*  what will the black box flight recorder reveal, [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7691.34s)]
*  but also how many other near misses between military [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7693.78s)]
*  and commercial aircraft have there ever been [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7696.82s)]
*  around Reagan National Airport [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7699.46s)]
*  and why was a military training exercise being conducted [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7700.82s)]
*  at that time in or near the airport's airspace? [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7703.8s)]
*  Even though those of us who live in Washington know [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7706.1s)]
*  these types of missions are going on all the time [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7708.46s)]
*  with commercial aircraft going in and out of Reagan. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7710.8s)]
*  We expect to hear more from the White House [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7712.66s)]
*  as the day unfolds, Tony. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7714.9s)]
*  Big test of course also for these new cabinet secretaries [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7716.599999999999s)]
*  who've been confirmed just in recent days. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7719.2s)]
*  Well, that's true Ed. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7721.94s)]
*  And while I have you, I wanna linger on that for a moment [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7722.86s)]
*  because it's been interesting to hear the message [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7724.78s)]
*  from transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7727.099999999999s)]
*  who said again that this was preventable. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7730.139999999999s)]
*  He was asked directly about that. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7732.0599999999995s)]
*  He also was at pains to make the point [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7733.8s)]
*  that he still considers the U.S. to have the quote, [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7735.74s)]
*  safest airspace in the world. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7738.18s)]
*  From your understanding of how these relationships work [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7741.22s)]
*  in Washington, how tightly would the White House [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7743.38s)]
*  and these cabinet secretaries, Duffy, [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7746.5s)]
*  and we're about to hear from Hegseth, [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7748.7s)]
*  be coordinating their message? [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7750.18s)]
*  Well, it depends on how long that White House [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7752.820000000001s)]
*  has been up and running and how closely [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7755.860000000001s)]
*  those communications teams are coordinating. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7757.860000000001s)]
*  There have been some examples this morning [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7759.820000000001s)]
*  of conflicting information on times and number of bodies [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7762.42s)]
*  that had been pulled from the water, for example. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7767.240000000001s)]
*  That's probably typical of sort of initial response [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7769.92s)]
*  to disasters like this. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7773.4400000000005s)]
*  And so you may have to be excused for that. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7775.68s)]
*  I think the bigger test will be throughout the rest of today. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7778.0s)]
*  To what extent does the White House coordinate its message [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7780.76s)]
*  with the transportation department, the defense department, [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7783.04s)]
*  and then the myriad of local and state agencies [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7785.92s)]
*  that literally sit here at this nexus over the airport, [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7789.0s)]
*  Virginia, the District of Columbia, Maryland, [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7791.400000000001s)]
*  the Federal Park Police, the local police, [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7794.06s)]
*  the state police, the FAA. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7796.72s)]
*  They've had these kinds of tests around here before [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7798.64s)]
*  for years, different kinds of incidents. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7801.240000000001s)]
*  The inauguration recently, for example. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7803.26s)]
*  So these are people who talk to each other all the time. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7804.860000000001s)]
*  The new people at the table, of course, [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7807.06s)]
*  are the Trump administration officials. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7809.06s)]
*  And so we'll be watching closely to see how they respond [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7811.08s)]
*  and what information they're sharing publicly. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7813.68s)]
*  Yeah, we will. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7816.96s)]
*  Ed, thank you very much. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7817.8s)]
*  I want to go now back over to Reagan Airport. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7818.64s)]
*  You see the tower behind me. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7820.8s)]
*  Caitlin Huey-Burns is there. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7821.96s)]
*  We were just there a moment ago. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7823.320000000001s)]
*  And Caitlin, it's an amazing situation there [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7825.0s)]
*  because you got on the one hand outside the windows [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7827.64s)]
*  a recovery operation underway. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7830.320000000001s)]
*  Dozens of bodies, as we understand it, still in the water. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7832.34s)]
*  But you also have an airport on the brink of reopening. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7836.04s)]
*  Passengers expecting to get on flight soon, [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7838.62s)]
*  wheeling luggage through there, [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7841.04s)]
*  even as loved ones are in a lounge somewhere, [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7842.8s)]
*  contemplating the absolute worst. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7845.6s)]
*  I mean, what is the mood and what are you able to hear [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7847.12s)]
*  at this hour where you are? [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7849.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Tony. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7852.12s)]
*  And just across the way here, [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7852.96s)]
*  I see President Trump's private plane, [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7855.52s)]
*  which is also stationed here at DCA. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7858.120000000001s)]
*  Usually on a Thursday here, [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7861.360000000001s)]
*  this place is flooded with lawmakers [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7863.320000000001s)]
*  trying to get out of Washington [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7865.68s)]
*  and back to their constituencies, [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7867.280000000001s)]
*  back to their home states and districts. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7869.8s)]
*  This airport is set to open [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7872.160000000001s)]
*  in just about an hour and a half. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7873.72s)]
*  Officials here just moments ago were saying [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7875.76s)]
*  that they are going ahead with that as planned. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7877.64s)]
*  Tony, I got here to this airport around two in the morning [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7880.120000000001s)]
*  and we were waiting and trying to see [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7884.2s)]
*  how family members of loved ones [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7887.08s)]
*  who were involved in that crash [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7890.36s)]
*  were assessing the information. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7893.04s)]
*  They were in a holding room [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7895.639999999999s)]
*  in an American Airlines lounge, [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7897.599999999999s)]
*  out of sight of our cameras, [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7900.099999999999s)]
*  though we were able to kind of see through a window. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7902.36s)]
*  They were past security, meeting with various officials. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7905.42s)]
*  We saw a member of the NTSB there, for example. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7908.88s)]
*  Shortly afterwards, I talked to a woman [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7912.92s)]
*  who had gotten to the airport at around three in the morning, [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7916.24s)]
*  looking for any sort of word for her friend [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7920.52s)]
*  who she knew to be on that flight, [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7923.68s)]
*  as you can imagine, you know, [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7925.8s)]
*  not wanting to talk to members of the media at that time, [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7927.4800000000005s)]
*  just wanting answers. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7930.400000000001s)]
*  I mentioned DCA and lawmakers here [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7932.52s)]
*  because this is a place that's heavily trafficked [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7935.4400000000005s)]
*  by lawmakers, [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7939.56s)]
*  but it's actually a very small airport [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7940.54s)]
*  when you all things considered. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7943.26s)]
*  And lawmakers have been raising concerns for a while now [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7945.1s)]
*  about how congested this airport is, [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7949.74s)]
*  how many flights arrive and take off from DCA. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7952.42s)]
*  This has been a big concern for local Senator Tim Kaine, [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7957.96s)]
*  who represents Virginia. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7962.1s)]
*  We are at DCA, [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7963.88s)]
*  but this is technically based in the state of Virginia. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7965.0199999999995s)]
*  He's talked about this for a while. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7968.7s)]
*  I cover Congress and there is a lot for Congress to do [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7971.179999999999s)]
*  in terms of oversight, especially of the FAA. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7974.86s)]
*  And I should note that the FAA [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7977.9s)]
*  does not currently have an administrator, [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7979.86s)]
*  doesn't have anybody nominated to that post. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7983.179999999999s)]
*  That post is usually a five-year term, [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7985.38s)]
*  and the person who held it just recently resigned early. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7987.84s)]
*  It's meant to be a five-year post [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7992.22s)]
*  so that it extends beyond a presidency [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7993.94s)]
*  so that it's not a political position. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7996.74s)]
*  So we're waiting to see if an acting administrator [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=7998.58s)]
*  is appointed there and kind of what that looks like. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8002.3s)]
*  But there are a lot of questions from lawmakers [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8005.86s)]
*  who know this area well [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8007.9s)]
*  and who have been raising concerns [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8010.38s)]
*  about the flight patterns. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8012.0199999999995s)]
*  But I should note too, that the biggest takeaway [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8012.98s)]
*  when I was here at this press conference, [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8015.72s)]
*  I asked, should Americans be concerned [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8017.86s)]
*  about their safety on these flights? [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8021.22s)]
*  And officials say they have no reason to believe otherwise. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8023.3s)]
*  All right, Caitlin, thank you very much. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8028.58s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8029.78s)]
*  We are still thinking about those loved ones [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8030.78s)]
*  who are waiting on word. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8033.82s)]
*  They, at this hour, have been told the worst. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8035.46s)]
*  We're also thinking about that Heartland City [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8037.3s)]
*  of Wichita, Kansas, that whole region, [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8038.78s)]
*  thinking about who they put on that airplane [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8041.22s)]
*  and what happens next. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8043.22s)]
*  We wanted answers on the military side of this, [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8044.66s)]
*  but we just got word that the Pentagon briefing [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8046.86s)]
*  will not happen as initially scheduled. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8049.1s)]
*  So it's been delayed. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8052.1s)]
*  We will have that update as soon as we know more. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8053.0199999999995s)]
*  But ahead in a moment, [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8055.5s)]
*  we're gonna talk to a commercial airline pilot [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8056.54s)]
*  with more than 30 years experience [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8058.74s)]
*  about how landing at Reagan is difficult, [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8060.34s)]
*  how this might've happened, [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8063.34s)]
*  everything he knows at this early hour. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8064.7s)]
*  Local news coming at you next. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=8066.78s)]

*  no one better in the field than you, [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9083.18s)]
*  I have to say, Mr. DiCoppo. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9085.699999999999s)]
*  But the little nugget that you said [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9087.06s)]
*  that you're looking at the flight manifest [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9089.38s)]
*  and it says that the flight has landed. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9091.22s)]
*  There's a man who gets a text from his wife [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9093.539999999999s)]
*  that says landing in 20 minutes. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9095.38s)]
*  All of those normal things that we've all experienced. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9097.34s)]
*  And I think that's why this is so frightening to me [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9100.06s)]
*  because we could have been on the plane, [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9102.26s)]
*  we could have been on the ground waiting for somebody. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9104.06s)]
*  And when you think about that, [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9106.019999999999s)]
*  it's just very, very unsettling. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9107.58s)]
*  Yet they say that aerospace, air travel is safe. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9109.14s)]
*  So I have to keep focusing on that as well. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9112.98s)]
*  But this is tough. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9115.34s)]
*  It is really tough, Gail. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9118.1s)]
*  And those are all the human details [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9119.42s)]
*  that keep lingering with me as well. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9120.66s)]
*  They're haunting. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9122.019999999999s)]
*  And it was incredible. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9122.859999999999s)]

*  walking through the airport, heads up, eyes clear. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9132.7s)]

*  to find victims after an American Airlines plane collided with an Army helicopter over Washington. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9380.06s)]
*  Emergency first responders are now scouring the river amid frigid temperatures. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9386.06s)]

*  So this was not unusual with military aircraft flying the river and aircraft landing at D.C. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9415.02s)]
*  We are now at a point where we are switching from a rescue operation to a recovery operation. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9423.02s)]
*  At this point, we don't believe there are any survivors from this accident. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9429.02s)]
*  There were 60 passengers and four crew on board the American Airlines flight. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9433.02s)]
*  The Army Blackhawk helicopter was on a training flight with a crew of three based at Fort Belvoir in Virginia. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9439.5s)]

*  Recovery teams are battling cold temperatures, wind and debris in the waist-deep water of the Potomac River. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9463.98s)]
*  And the mayor of Wichita, Kansas, spoke earlier this morning about this unfolding tragedy. [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9469.98s)]

*  CBS News White House reporter Aaron Navarro joins me now with more on this. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9493.98s)]
*  Aaron, we saw President Donald Trump put out a statement overnight and we're just now learning he's expected to hold a news conference at around 11 o'clock this morning from the White House. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9497.98s)]
*  What more do we know? [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9507.98s)]
*  It'll be his first remarks on camera in that White House briefing room, as you mentioned, at 11 o'clock. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9509.98s)]
*  He also posted on Truth Social this morning saying that he has, quote, been fully briefed on the terrible accident that took place at DCA. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9516.46s)]
*  May God bless their souls. [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9524.46s)]
*  So we're expecting to hear more from Trump. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9526.46s)]
*  We've been hearing from Transportation Secretary Duffy, who was just sworn in yesterday as they have been giving information as they can about the recovery efforts, about how NTSB is leading the investigation. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9528.46s)]
*  We saw Defense Department Secretary Pete Hegseth put out a video just about an hour or so ago saying that they are actively working to investigate what occurred and why. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9542.939999999999s)]

*  And I'm just wondering as well, is this expected to impact at all the confirmation hearings for the president's cabinet nominees today? [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9556.939999999999s)]

*  We have not seen any indication that those would be delayed because of this crash. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9571.42s)]
*  And any indication what Donald Trump might be saying at that briefing later on this morning? [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9573.42s)]
*  We haven't gotten any background confirmation on what he's going to talk about or what he's going to say at this briefing. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9577.42s)]
*  We did hear or at least see the president at least muse about what happened, saying that it was, quote, preventable. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9583.42s)]
*  You heard Secretary Duffy at a press conference this morning agree with President Trump saying it was preventable just given the collision course that these two aircrafts were on. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9591.42s)]

*  And what did we hear from Pete Hegsath earlier today? [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9612.9s)]
*  Yeah, so that came out literally a half hour ago. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9616.9s)]
*  I know the previous reporter said it was about an hour ago. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9618.9s)]
*  So this is what Secretary of Defense Pete Hegsath had to say. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9620.9s)]
*  Just to repeat, annual proficiency training flight is what this crew was on. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9624.9s)]
*  In terms of experience, he said they were fairly experienced. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9629.38s)]
*  Those are the words that he used. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9633.38s)]
*  He was supposed to hold a briefing here, by the way, and we were expecting that by the half hour ago. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9635.38s)]
*  But instead, he's sort of been back into the White House to brief the president essentially about what we're talking about here. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9639.38s)]
*  They did have night vision goggles because that has come up. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9645.38s)]
*  What we don't know is whether they were using them at the time or whether they had other equipment like traffic collision avoidance systems, which commercial aircraft did not have. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9649.38s)]
*  Commercial aircraft do have, but fixed wing and rotary aircraft in the military, that's not always standard. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9658.859999999999s)]
*  We also don't know. [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9664.859999999999s)]
*  We know where this crew came from, and there's been a 48-hour pause on that entire unit and division while the investigation takes place. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9666.859999999999s)]
*  The Army and the DOD are helping the NTSB with the investigation. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9678.859999999999s)]
*  But we don't know. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9685.34s)]
*  We know where they're from. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9686.34s)]
*  We don't know where their flight path was. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9687.34s)]
*  There have been some reports that we haven't been able to confirm that they may have left from Langley, the CIA area. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9689.34s)]
*  We can't confirm that, but there are reports, and people have been looking at the flight lines. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9697.34s)]
*  And I have to drill down on this. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9702.34s)]
*  I've been here for six months or so, and I was astonished with the amount of traffic. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9704.34s)]
*  To see Black Hawk helicopters up and down the Potomac right around Reagan National is routine. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9709.82s)]
*  That's not rare at all. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9716.82s)]
*  Even at night, it happens all the time. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9718.82s)]
*  And I was really surprised when I came here to see that sort of thing, because the aircraft coming over this building at such low levels, [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9720.82s)]
*  I mean the commercial aircraft, passenger airlines, and then you've got helicopters. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9727.82s)]
*  And again, to suggest that this is a training flight doesn't necessarily suggest that the crew was inexperienced. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9733.3s)]
*  This is an annual proficiency test and night flying. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9742.3s)]
*  And I think we really have to determine what went wrong. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9746.3s)]
*  I hate to use the term stay in their lane, but it is such a congested high traffic area. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9750.3s)]
*  And military aircraft do have to coexist side by side with this very busy airport, which is right in the centre of town essentially. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9756.779999999999s)]
*  But this is routine. This shouldn't have been anything out of the ordinary that would have caused this collision. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9764.779999999999s)]
*  That's a really important point, I think, to make, Charlie. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9770.779999999999s)]
*  When people think of training flights, often they may think of inexperienced pilots. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9773.779999999999s)]
*  Based on what Pete Hegsett said in that video just released, as you mentioned, about half an hour ago, [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9778.779999999999s)]
*  is there any better explanation for what may have happened and how those pilots were trained to handle a situation like this? [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9785.26s)]
*  Well, I don't know. Are you going to play the clip now to hear it? [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9795.26s)]
*  I believe we do not have that prepared at the moment. [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9798.26s)]
*  OK, we've got it. Let's listen in. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9800.26s)]
*  The unit involved, the army unit involved with Bravo Company 12th Aviation Battalion at Fort Belvoir, it was an annual proficiency training flight. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9804.26s)]
*  And when we look at the crew, and not all can have been notified, so we're going to withhold ranks and names at this point. [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9812.74s)]
*  We do know on our side who was involved. [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9819.74s)]
*  It was a fairly experienced crew that was doing a required annual night evaluation. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9822.74s)]
*  They did have night vision goggles. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9829.74s)]
*  The 12th Aviation Battalion, as of now, has granted a 48-hour operational pause on contingency missions as what happened is reviewed. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9833.22s)]
*  And a senior-level aviation team, an investigative team from our Aviation Safety Center, was deployed last night and already is in Washington, D.C. to investigate what's going on. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9843.22s)]
*  We anticipate that the investigation will quickly be able to determine whether the aircraft was in the corridor and at the right altitude at the time of the incident. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9853.22s)]
*  So there you have it. I mean, not a lot of detail there. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9863.22s)]
*  Importantly, fairly experienced crew. This is a routine annual proficiency test. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9867.22s)]
*  The battalion has been put on pause for 48 hours. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9872.22s)]
*  My understanding is he doesn't want to get ahead of the briefing of the president at the White House with the information that he's got. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9876.22s)]
*  OK, a lot of news to follow here. Thank you so much, Charlie. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9881.22s)]
*  And CBS News correspondent Natalie Brand is joining us now outside Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Virginia. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9885.699999999999s)]
*  Natalie, good to see you. We know some of the victims' family members were there overnight waiting for answers. [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9892.699999999999s)]
*  What's being provided to them right now? What are they being told to do? [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9898.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this is just so heartbreaking and devastating, Chanel. [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9904.699999999999s)]
*  The American Airlines CEO was here in D.C. [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9907.699999999999s)]
*  Well, he is still here. He was at that press conference earlier this morning updating the media, obviously expressing deep sorrow for those impacted, [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9912.18s)]
*  the families of the 60 victims, the passengers on that flight and the four crew members. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9922.18s)]
*  And as we continue to learn more about who was on board, we know that the U.S. figure skating community put out a statement earlier this morning [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9929.18s)]
*  saying that sadly, you know, they confirmed that members, several of their community were on board that flight returning to D.C. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9938.66s)]
*  from a training program. And just within the last hour, we learned that that includes six people from the skating club of Boston, [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9946.66s)]
*  the CEO of that club saying two coaches, two teenage athletes and the athletes' moms. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9955.66s)]
*  He went on to say it's a close knit bond. And I think for all of us, we've lost family. [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9961.66s)]
*  So those just some of the people on board that flight from Kansas here to Washington and then, of course, the military service members on board the Black Hawk. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9968.14s)]
*  I know you were just talking at length about that. Such a huge tragedy. So much grief to process here on the ground. [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9979.14s)]
*  And amid all that grief, Natalie, of course, the search and recovery mission continues. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9986.14s)]
*  And this is going to be a huge, huge mission under really tough conditions. [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9990.14s)]
*  Talk about what's happening on the ground there this hour. [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=9995.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah, overnight, Chanel, first responders, hundreds of them were searching, combing through the Potomac River, [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10000.619999999999s)]
*  looking for any sign of life when this was still a rescue operation. They were working in extremely cold, frigid waters. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10008.619999999999s)]
*  It was very windy last night. So facing the complication of wind, again, extremely low temperatures and the darkness. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10017.1s)]
*  Now that the sun is out, at least that provides a little bit of relief. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10026.1s)]
*  But this has sadly, as you mentioned, turned into a recovery effort. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10032.1s)]
*  And they will have to expect it to work through the coming days to try to retrieve more bodies from the Potomac. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10037.1s)]
*  As you've been reporting, CBS News has learned from a law enforcement source that at least 30 bodies have been recovered so far. [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10046.58s)]
*  All right, Natalie Brand in Washington. Thank you. [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10053.58s)]
*  And I want to bring in Stephen Wallace now, a former director of accident investigations for the FAA. [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10057.58s)]
*  Stephen, thanks for joining us. The NTSB, we understand, has now taken over this investigation. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10063.58s)]
*  What does that mean and what are next steps? How are these government bodies are working together to find out what happened? [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10069.58s)]
*  Well, there will be parties to the investigation. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10076.58s)]
*  The NTSB will run the investigation and determine the probable cause. [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10079.58s)]
*  But I worked alongside of them for many years and I can say they are extremely thorough and extremely methodical. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10084.58s)]
*  And they don't speculate and they don't rush to conclusions. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10093.58s)]
*  So, you know, on this tragic day one where the pain of these families is so powerful, [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10098.06s)]
*  and people want answers immediately and of course there aren't answers immediately. [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10109.06s)]
*  But I'm very confident that the NTSB thoroughly examines every piece of evidence. [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10117.539999999999s)]
*  And there is almost any evidence that you could want is available in this accident. [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10126.539999999999s)]
*  The airliner will have state of the art voice and data recorders. [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10132.539999999999s)]
*  There's video, there are eyewitnesses, and there's all the wreckage. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10137.539999999999s)]
*  They will get to the truth, but they never rush to it. [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10145.02s)]
*  They never try to rush to a conclusion. Quite the opposite. [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10150.02s)]
*  Stephen, you know, there's so many questions right now about communication [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10154.02s)]
*  and what kind of conversations happen between air traffic control and the two flights that were involved here. [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10158.02s)]
*  Air traffic apparently said to the helicopter, do you see the plane? The Army aircraft said yes. [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10164.02s)]
*  So what may have happened here? [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10170.02s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to speculate, but you can just, you know, from your own experience driving over those bridges and everything, [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10173.5s)]
*  you know, there's a lot of lights in every direction. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10181.5s)]
*  And so is it possible that the pilots of the helicopter saw an aircraft, [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10184.5s)]
*  but it wasn't the right aircraft or saw something else? [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10194.5s)]
*  We just don't know. And I'm just not going to speculate. [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10198.98s)]
*  Was there a call to abort? Do we know anything about why that happened or didn't happen? [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10203.98s)]
*  I mean, would air traffic control not be able to see that this was coming? [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10208.98s)]
*  Well, I mean, the see and avoid and the air traffic control spoke to the helicopter pilot and told them, [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10213.98s)]
*  you know, it's a permitted thing where they can say, do you, can you, have you visually acquired, [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10218.98s)]
*  do you see the aircraft and stay behind it? [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10224.46s)]
*  I would point out here that the airliner is equipped with a collision avoidance system, [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10230.46s)]
*  which will see the helicopter has a transponder and everything, which will make it visible. [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10236.46s)]
*  But that system called TCAS is inhibited at very low altitudes, like below 500 feet typically, [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10241.46s)]
*  because you would get just so many random advisories that it's where it's dangerous to really maneuver quickly close to the ground. [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10250.939999999999s)]
*  So those systems, they still provide the traffic alert, but they don't up in the air. [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10260.939999999999s)]
*  They'll say fly up, fly down. They'll give a very direct collision avoidance instruction, [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10267.939999999999s)]
*  which that function will be inhibited as the aircraft is close to the ground. [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10272.939999999999s)]
*  And this collision occurred extremely close to the ground. [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10278.42s)]
*  All right, Stephen Wallace, thanks for your time and perspective. [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10282.42s)]
*  Thank you, Chanel. [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10285.42s)]
*  We're going to have much more continuing coverage of this breaking news as we learn more about what happened here. [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10287.42s)]
*  Stay with us. [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10292.42s)]

*  Welcome back. A search and recovery effort is currently underway in the Potomac River in Washington, D.C. [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10492.859999999999s)]
*  to find victims after an American Airlines plane collided with an Army helicopter over Washington. [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10498.859999999999s)]
*  Emergency first responders are now scouring the river amid frigid temperatures. [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10504.859999999999s)]
*  And officials say around 30 bodies have been recovered so far, with another 30 still missing. [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10510.34s)]
*  The National Transportation Safety Board is leading the investigation right now. [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10516.34s)]
*  And next hour we expect to hear from President Donald Trump. [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10520.34s)]
*  For now, I want to bring in CBS News Homeland Security correspondent Nicole Skanga. [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10524.34s)]
*  Nicole, what are we hearing from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem? [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10528.34s)]
*  And what will the agency really be looking into here? [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10532.34s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security surging resources from the U.S. Coast Guard. [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10536.82s)]
*  And we know that there were rescue boats sent in the very early hours of this morning from both station Washington and station St. Indigos. [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10541.82s)]
*  And so a lot of personnel convening here on the Potomac River, including the Coast Guard, [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10551.82s)]
*  but also working in coordination with some of the local and state law enforcement on the ground. [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10558.82s)]
*  We know that D.C. police and EMS fire. They are the lead right now and they're working with federal partners. [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10565.3s)]
*  FBI is also assisting, though we should point out that at this point, no indication of any sort of criminal intent here. [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10571.3s)]
*  And that is part of the reason this is being investigated, not by the FBI, but by the NTSB. [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10578.3s)]
*  You mentioned it earlier, the National Transportation Safety Board. [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10584.3s)]
*  We're hearing a lot of questions from the NTSB and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10588.779999999999s)]
*  We're hearing a lot of questions from the NTSB and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10592.779999999999s)]

*  They were just frankly floored by this collision. [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10615.26s)]
*  They have a lot of questions and they'll be very eager to hear from the NTSB on that black box, [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10617.26s)]
*  They have a lot of questions and they'll be very eager to hear from the NTSB on that black box, [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10619.26s)]
*  They have a lot of questions and they'll be very eager to hear from the NTSB on that black box, [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10621.26s)]
*  that flight recorder to determine what was the communication like between the helicopter pilots, [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10623.26s)]
*  that flight recorder to determine what was the communication like between the helicopter pilots, [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10625.26s)]
*  those three soldiers that we know were in that Army Blackhawk and the plane itself. [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10627.26s)]
*  those three soldiers that we know were in that Army Blackhawk and the plane itself. [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10629.74s)]
*  We heard earlier today from the transportation secretary saying that he believes that the [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10636.22s)]
*  helicopter was aware of the plane's presence. [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10641.82s)]
*  He was unclear on whether that plane was aware of the helicopter's presence. [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10644.62s)]
*  And now typically helicopters that fly in this airspace tend to look out for those planes. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10648.94s)]
*  They tend to navigate around them. [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10653.74s)]
*  They're in constant communication with air traffic control. [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10655.18s)]
*  So just a lot of questions right now about how this might have happened. [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10658.22s)]
*  But certainly a full show of force from all agencies across the federal and state and [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10662.779999999999s)]
*  local governments here. [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10669.019999999999s)]
*  At least 300 personnel on the river alone. [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10670.859999999999s)]
*  And I will tell you that when I drove here late last night shortly after the crash, [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10673.42s)]
*  it was just a sea of red lights. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10677.82s)]
*  And you know, I think mentioning the location is so important here. [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10680.3s)]
*  It is, can be, I guess a crowded airport often filled with lawmakers. [[02:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10684.22s)]
*  Who are traveling to and from D.C. [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10688.06s)]
*  So does that bring with it any concerns about aviation operations or national security? [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10689.66s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10696.539999999999s)]
*  And in fact, earlier today we were at a press conference with several lawmakers, [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10697.18s)]
*  lawmakers from Kansas, lawmakers from Virginia. [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10701.98s)]
*  Many of them sit on prominent commerce transportation committees on the hill. [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10704.939999999999s)]
*  Certainly they spoke out today and saying now is not the time to call into question [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10710.22s)]
*  exactly what happened before we have all the facts laid out before us. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10715.34s)]
*  But you can bet given the proximity of this incident and just how [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10719.1s)]
*  intimately so many lawmakers relate to this airport, they're in and out of it all the time. [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10723.02s)]
*  There is going to be an ongoing probe. [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10728.86s)]
*  Many questions to the FAA, many questions to the Department of Transportation, [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10731.42s)]
*  many questions regarding that NTSB investigation to determine really how could this have happened. [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10736.78s)]
*  It's a very controlled airspace here in Washington, D.C. [[02:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10743.02s)]
*  You can't just fly a drone up in the air. [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10746.220000000001s)]
*  There are TRs everywhere. [[02:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10747.980000000001s)]
*  And so for something like this to happen in a city that is used to all of this federal and state and [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10749.74s)]
*  commercial coordination has taken a lot of pilots, folks, lawmakers I'm talking to off guard and [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10755.66s)]
*  certainly, you know, a lot of folks demanding answers here. [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10762.62s)]
*  But I should say right now and today the feeling in this airport and being here on the scene [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10765.74s)]
*  is that the focus right now is on the victims. [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10771.34s)]
*  There are 67 people, about half of whom are still unaccounted for. [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10774.22s)]
*  There is that recovery effort underway right now trying to, you know, pull all of the bodies, [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10780.14s)]
*  all of the debris out of the river, the concern about, of course, the families and the loved [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10786.86s)]
*  ones of these victims, lifting them up and supporting them. [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10791.5s)]
*  And so that is truly the focus today. [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10794.7s)]
*  You can bet that in a city like Washington, D.C., the focus is going to shift on the investigation [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10797.34s)]
*  in due time when it's appropriate. [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10804.22s)]
*  All right. Thank you so much, Nicole. [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10806.78s)]
*  And CBS News congressional reporter Torian Small joins us now. [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10809.18s)]
*  Torian, we should mention this comes on a pretty busy day on the Hill. [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10813.34s)]
*  There are a few big hearings set to happen. [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10816.300000000001s)]
*  How are lawmakers there responding? [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10818.460000000001s)]
*  Yes, Chanel, several hearings going on. [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10820.7s)]
*  That includes Tosie Gabbard, Trump's pick to head the DNI. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10823.02s)]
*  And then Cash Patel, a controversial figure among Democrats here who Trump tapped to lead the FBI. [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10826.94s)]
*  I want to say, though, that as these two are underway, several other committees have addressed [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10835.1s)]
*  the situation. I want to point out the words from ranking member Jack Reed on the Senate [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10841.82s)]
*  Armed Services Committee. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10846.78s)]
*  He led this hearing by saying in part that this is a tragedy beyond words [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10848.54s)]
*  that his thoughts are with the families of those on board both aircraft as well as the entire army [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10853.42s)]
*  community. That committee also held a moment of silence before it began its duties or its work [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10858.7s)]
*  that it's doing today. [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10867.26s)]
*  Back to these committee hearings, though, Patel is under a microscope by Democrats, [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10868.62s)]
*  many of them calling him unqualified and unfit to lead the FBI, calling into question his loyalty [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10873.58s)]
*  to Trump and whether or not that would impact the department's ability to be independent from [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10880.7s)]
*  the president moving forward. [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10885.900000000001s)]
*  We heard so far in his hearing that the chairman, Chuck Grassley, defended a lot of the allegations [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10887.5s)]
*  around Patel before he had the opportunity to speak. [[03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10895.900000000001s)]
*  Patel's in the hot seat right now giving his opening statements, looking to rebut some of [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10898.060000000001s)]
*  the concerns that we've already heard from Democrats. [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10903.58s)]
*  And, Torian, we're also expecting to hear from President Donald Trump at 11 o'clock this morning. [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10906.859999999999s)]
*  What more do we know about that? [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10911.34s)]
*  Right, the president is set to speak in the 11 a.m. hour and address not only what he's been briefed [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10913.26s)]
*  on but also send his condolences to the family. [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10919.58s)]
*  We heard from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who didn't want to get ahead of the president by [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10922.539999999999s)]
*  releasing too much information but did confirm some details that we know that the three [[03:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10928.38s)]
*  army members involved in this crash were highly experienced and that they were doing a routine [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10935.5s)]
*  training procedure when this happened. [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10944.220000000001s)]
*  So we're expected to hear the president reiterate those words and then probably give more detail [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10947.02s)]
*  and insight into what exactly happened. [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10951.820000000002s)]
*  All right, Torian Small, thank you. [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=10954.380000000001s)]

*  You're not answering my question. [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11027.66s)]
*  This really is. [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11028.7s)]

*  We continue to follow some breaking news this hour. [[03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11167.1s)]
*  Right now, there is a search and recovery effort underway in the Potomac River in Washington, DC. [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11169.66s)]
*  They're trying to find victims there after an American Airlines plane [[03:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11176.060000000001s)]
*  collided with an Army helicopter over Washington. [[03:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11179.18s)]

*  Next hour, we expect to hear from the President, Donald Trump. [[03:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11191.98s)]
*  And CBS News White House reporter Aaron Navarro joins me now with more on this. [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11195.34s)]
*  Aaron, talk about the timing here because we were supposed to hear from Pete Hegseth, [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11199.98s)]
*  defense secretary. [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11203.66s)]
*  He was supposed to hold a briefing that was canceled. [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11205.1s)]
*  He instead put out a video. [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11207.74s)]
*  Now we know we're going to hear from President Donald Trump in just about 30 minutes. [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11209.42s)]
*  So talk about what happened there. [[03:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11213.98s)]
*  Could potentially see Secretary Hegseth at that briefing, still working to see [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11215.82s)]
*  exactly who will be with him in just half an hour. [[03:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11220.62s)]
*  We saw, as you mentioned, Hegseth lay out some of the details, not necessarily getting ahead [[03:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11223.34s)]
*  of what we know or getting ahead of the President, but laying out some of the details about the [[03:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11227.58s)]
*  training that the military helicopter was on last night. [[03:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11231.42s)]
*  And just one thing to mention, just given the timing of all of this, there is no [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11235.42s)]
*  Senate-confirmed head of the FAA right now. [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11240.460000000001s)]
*  The head before had resigned on January 20th, leading into the next administration. [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11243.66s)]
*  There was someone that was brought up who had worked at the FAA before. [[03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11249.5s)]
*  But just the timing, it being so close to the presidential transition, so close to President [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11253.82s)]
*  Trump's first days in office, could potentially make things difficult as the agencies look to [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11259.02s)]
*  work through and get to the investigation part of all of this. [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11267.1s)]
*  Interesting that you mentioned that. [[03:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11269.9s)]
*  Also want to ask whether this may or may not impact those confirmation hearings [[03:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11271.82s)]
*  for President Donald Trump's cabinet nominees supposed to happen today. [[03:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11276.699999999999s)]
*  We've seen those still stay on for both Tulsi Gabbard and Cash Patel. [[03:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11280.3s)]
*  You're seeing at least at the start of those hearings, the ranking members and chairman [[03:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11284.46s)]
*  acknowledge what happened in Washington, D.C. last night. [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11289.18s)]
*  But so far, those are still on as Trump's picks and his administration is working to [[03:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11292.779999999999s)]
*  get them through and fully confirmed. [[03:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11297.58s)]
*  Got it. [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11300.619999999999s)]
*  Okay, Aaron Navarro, thank you. [[03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11301.019999999999s)]
*  Take care. [[03:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11303.1s)]
*  And joining me now is Linda Tran. [[03:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11303.82s)]
*  She served as director of public engagement and senior advisor to former U.S. Secretary [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11305.34s)]
*  of Transportation Pete Buttigieg. [[03:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11310.14s)]
*  Linda, thank you for joining us. [[03:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11312.62s)]
*  Walk us through what the investigation might look like right now at a federal level. [[03:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11314.14s)]
*  Absolutely. [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11319.66s)]
*  Great to be with you, Chanel. [[03:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11320.380000000001s)]
*  So right now that we've turned the switch over to the recovery side of things, what it really [[03:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11321.74s)]
*  means is that the NTSB is on the driver's seat. [[03:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11326.3s)]
*  And so what you'll see is DOT and the FAA move to support the NTSB's independent investigation [[03:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11329.42s)]
*  in all the ways they can, whether that is helping to provide technology, looking into [[03:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11336.14s)]
*  the digital trail with them, sharing communicates that occurred across the agency, things that [[03:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11341.5s)]
*  the air traffic control tower was able to transmit to both aircraft, that sort of information, [[03:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11347.18s)]
*  which will ultimately help the NTSB provide its recommendations, its assessment of what [[03:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11352.38s)]
*  the causes were for this tragic collision and what it thinks the next step should be. [[03:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11358.06s)]
*  Linda, I want to ask you about something that Aaron Navarro had just mentioned, that right [[03:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11361.98s)]
*  now there is no Senate confirmed head of the FAA. [[03:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11365.58s)]
*  How may that impact the investigation? [[03:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11368.859999999999s)]
*  Well, look, I think it's definitely important to have a confirmed member, a confirmed [[03:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11372.38s)]
*  administrator for the Federal Aviation Administration in the seat, in large part because [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11376.939999999999s)]
*  this is what helps to translate what the vision of the White House is to that agency. [[03:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11381.74s)]
*  But it should be noted that there are extremely senior and capable [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11387.18s)]
*  career civil servants that are at the helm at the FAA right now. We do have a deputy administrator, [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11391.98s)]
*  as I understand it, who is going to be incoming, who was a former staffer at the FAA. And you [[03:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11397.74s)]
*  have the head of the air traffic organization, who is a longtime both pilot as well as a policy [[03:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11402.94s)]
*  expert, who is certainly going to be knee deep in all of this moving forward. So it's really just [[03:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11409.58s)]
*  a testament to how important it is to have these federal career civil servants who, you know, [[03:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11415.34s)]
*  whether through any sort of a political transition, who are the institutional knowledge [[03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11419.9s)]
*  and understand what the appropriate standard operating procedures should be, who understand [[03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11423.98s)]
*  what the remedies could be moving forward. You know, I also want to mention the timing [[03:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11429.1s)]
*  here. We're just over 20 minutes away from the airport reopening for air travel this morning. [[03:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11433.9s)]
*  For people who may look at what happened overnight and be concerned about getting [[03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11440.62s)]
*  back on a plane, what are officials saying to them today? I mean, look, I think it's entirely [[03:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11444.54s)]
*  reasonable looking at this really horrific footage that we've seen breaking overnight for people to [[03:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11450.140000000001s)]
*  be concerned about whether their loved ones are safe as they're going in and out of this airport [[03:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11455.42s)]
*  in particular. But what I can tell you is that, you know, we have had literally billions of flights [[03:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11459.820000000002s)]
*  take off and land safely at a national airport during the time since the previous sort of crash [[03:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11465.5s)]
*  occurred. And so they should be assured it is still very, very safe. It is the safest [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11471.66s)]
*  form of transportation there is. Okay, Linda, thank you. I want to now bring in CBS News [[03:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11475.66s)]
*  Homeland Security correspondent Nicole Skanga. Nicole, take it away. Hi there. I am joined by [[03:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11481.5s)]
*  the D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who's here with me. And we are just moments away from Reagan [[03:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11489.5s)]
*  National Airport reopening. So, Mayor, are all systems go? Is it business as usual? And what [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11495.42s)]
*  do you tell travelers who say they might be a little fearful to fly today? Well, first and [[03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11501.1s)]
*  foremost, our hearts and our prayers go out to all of the families impacted by this horrific [[03:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11505.9s)]
*  collision. I am very proud of our first responders in D.C. and in the entire region who have gone into [[03:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11512.86s)]
*  the conditions such that they are to try to bring everyone out of the river. And so that effort [[03:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11523.82s)]
*  continues. I think the message was very clear from the Secretary of Transportation as well as the [[03:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11531.18s)]
*  airport's director in the FAA saying that there's no reason not to resume a flight activity into [[03:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11538.220000000001s)]
*  Reagan Washington National Airport. And that's going to happen at 11. We should say that anybody [[03:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11547.019999999999s)]
*  who has travel plans should check with their carrier because we know that carriers are adjusting [[03:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11554.38s)]
*  flights. Yeah, and it's going to be important to double check today. You talked about that colossal [[03:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11560.06s)]
*  effort by federal, state, local law enforcement first responders. Absolutely. You've been in [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11565.42s)]
*  meetings all day. What is the latest you can tell us about this recovery operation? And in particular, [[03:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11570.62s)]
*  I mean, it's going to be so critical this next phase for bringing some sense of peace and solace [[03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11577.42s)]
*  to the families of victims too. Absolutely. Well, the airline, of course, is working with the families [[03:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11582.300000000001s)]
*  that were on the plane. The Department of Defense is working with the military personnel to make [[03:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11588.54s)]
*  sure families are notified. The National Transportation Safety Board becomes the lead [[03:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11594.86s)]
*  agency now on the investigation because I know people have a lot of questions and want to be [[03:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11600.54s)]
*  assured that their skies are safe. Absolutely. And I want to bring up because for those who might [[03:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11605.900000000001s)]
*  not be familiar with Washington, D.C., this is a very controlled, meticulous airspace. There is a [[03:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11612.460000000001s)]
*  lot of coordination between federal, local, commercial, which makes this all the more [[03:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11618.460000000001s)]
*  shocking, quite frankly, of an event for those who are not used to how the airspace is here. [[03:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11623.9s)]
*  Talk about that. Well, the airspace is different here because of the federal assets of our nation, [[03:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11629.42s)]
*  the White House, the Capitol, the Congress. So there is more restricted airspace here. For example, [[03:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11635.02s)]
*  you wouldn't see like a small plane that someone was operating at a different airport. She just [[03:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11641.34s)]
*  wouldn't see that. The fact that there was a military aircraft involved, they don't have the [[03:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11648.94s)]
*  same restrictions that other like private or commercial small planes would have. So the fact [[03:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11656.300000000001s)]
*  that it was a military plane and a commercial plane would explain how it could be in a restricted [[03:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11662.62s)]
*  airspace. Yeah, and we expect all of that to be part of the investigation. Absolutely. We know [[03:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11669.02s)]
*  that the NTSB is likely to brief us later today on that. What questions are you asking as this [[03:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11673.18s)]
*  investigation continues? Well, what we will want to know, of course, is why were the two aircraft [[03:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11679.98s)]
*  in such close proximity? Did they both have permission to be in close proximity? Do we need [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11688.300000000001s)]
*  to make some changes either to the flight plans for the commercial aircraft or for the military [[03:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11695.9s)]
*  aircraft? And certainly we would want to see some a pause in some of those those flights close to [[03:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11702.62s)]
*  the airport. Yeah, especially those training flights. Lastly, I do want to ask specifically [[03:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11709.900000000001s)]
*  about the victims and their families. Do you have the reassurances from the chief of fire and EMS [[03:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11714.94s)]
*  here that they are going to ensure that every last individual is recovered? Absolutely. And [[03:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11721.740000000002s)]
*  furthermore, is DC planning any services or events or even counseling for some of the families [[03:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11728.06s)]
*  impacted? Well, for sure, we're following the the lead of American Airlines and they have [[03:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11733.34s)]
*  processes in place that they are relying on. We have our own first responders who we will want to [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11739.26s)]
*  support with counseling who've been in the water and unfortunately, you know, is traumatic to be [[03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11747.66s)]
*  involved in these recovery efforts. So we're going to be supporting them every step of the way. We [[03:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11754.14s)]
*  have a very robust response team in our Department of Human Services and we'll be ready to be there [[03:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11759.9s)]
*  also with families who will likely be coming to our medical examiner's office. Madam Mayor, [[03:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11766.14s)]
*  we know so many of our viewers across the country are their hearts are with us here in Washington, [[03:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11771.34s)]

*  as to how much food you've rescued from the landfill? We've rescued four and a half million [[03:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11906.300000000001s)]
*  pounds. I can't even fathom how much food that is. And that's one little person in one little city [[03:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11911.34s)]
*  in America. We're going to call this chicken piccata. We did 450 of these meals today. This is the exact dish [[03:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11917.58s)]
*  you and I are going to have. Yep. That's really good. Is it good? Having a plan of how to keep people fed [[03:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11925.18s)]

*  to find victims along the Potomac River in Washington D.C. An American Airlines plane [[03:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=11998.78s)]
*  collided with an Army helicopter over Washington. Officials there say more than two dozen bodies [[03:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12004.060000000001s)]
*  have been recovered so far and President Trump will speak just around 11 o'clock this morning. [[03:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12009.58s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News congressional correspondent Caitlin Huey-Burns for more on this. [[03:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12015.66s)]
*  Caitlin what are we learning about the victims right now? [[03:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12021.18s)]
*  Hey well we have been here at DCA airport since about two in the morning and we saw family members of victims gathering in a lounge, an American Airlines lounge talking to officials trying to get more information. [[03:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12023.9s)]
*  We learned early this morning that this went from a rescue effort to a recovery effort and unfortunately profoundly sorry to hear that. [[03:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12039.66s)]
*  There have been that officials believe there have been no survivors of this collision. We have been briefed by various officials including the brand new transportation secretary who said that this could have been avoided. [[03:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12051.82s)]
*  Just to give you a little bit of context here at this airport. This is an airport heavily trafficked by lawmakers getting in and out of Washington to their home districts and states. [[03:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12067.1s)]
*  Typically on a Thursday like this you'll see a lot of lawmakers trying to get home. It's a small airport however and there's been a lot of concern among some lawmakers that this is an airport that's too congested, that there are too many flights coming in and out. [[03:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12079.18s)]
*  But officials were also stressing that the flight patterns that we saw yesterday not only from the flight, the American Airlines commercial flight landing here at DCA but also with the military Black Hawk that was flying is also a normal activity. [[03:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12097.5s)]
*  We see this all the time. So there are questions about how of course this collision happened, whether it was a communications failure and the like. Those questions remain. All of this now moves into the purview of the NTSB which will run its investigation. [[03:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12115.82s)]
*  So at the top of the hour we are expecting to hear from President Trump who will be joined by his transportation secretary and also his defense secretary to perhaps answer some of those questions about how this Black Hawk helicopter collided with this American Airlines flight. [[03:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12133.26s)]
*  We're also told that what we know about the victims is we don't know much about them but we also know that members of the U.S. figure skating team were on that flight having competed in Wichita and coming back to Washington. [[03:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12153.42s)]
*  We don't know exactly who was on that flight yet but those are people that we are watching of course. No one can imagine what these families are going through as they're waiting for answers and as the recovery effort continues. [[03:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12171.74s)]
*  They had 300 first responders here on site shortly after that collision happened shortly before 9 p.m. last night. [[03:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12189.98s)]
*  And Caitlin I know you got there sometime around 2 o'clock this morning and there were a lot of family members who were there trying to figure out what's going on and get some answers. Talk about the mood there. [[03:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12199.82s)]
*  Yeah I mean as you can imagine you hear about this happening and you wonder was someone I know on that flight. We saw they basically had a holding room for family members or acquaintances of loved ones who believed that they had family members or loved ones on that flight. [[03:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12209.74s)]
*  There's a holding room in the American Airlines lounge which is through the security barrier so we did not have access to it but we could see through a window and I saw many people in that lounge meeting with officials. [[03:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12233.34s)]
*  We saw one member of the NTSB there as well at least one member. You know as you can envision it people touching each other's shoulders you know taking comfort in the idea that they were going through this tragedy together but also this you know wanting to know answers. [[03:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12248.38s)]
*  I talked to one woman who arrived about 3 in the morning. She got in her car parked right outside the airport and went in said that she was looking for any news about her friend who was on that flight. [[03:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12269.18s)]
*  So of course those victims are top of mind for us as we learn in the coming hours or days exactly who they are. And we also know that this investigation continues and recovery efforts continue as well. [[03:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12283.5s)]
*  All right. And Caitlin can you walk us through in terms of the operation on the ground the search and rescue operation that is now a recovery operation. What's happening there because we understand the conditions are a bit tough. [[03:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12299.5s)]
*  Yeah that's right. Yesterday when this crash happened the skies were clear officials here today noted that. So that also goes into the questions about how this exactly happened. [[03:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12311.66s)]
*  But it is also very cold here. It has been cold here for quite some time. Just a couple of weeks ago we had a big snowstorm. So as you can imagine these waters are cold. We also learned from officials that that commercial American Airlines flight when it was discovered it was broken into three parts and recovery efforts. [[03:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12321.74s)]
*  Those involved in that effort were at least waist deep going through the water here on the Potomac. And so when I got here in the wee hours of the morning you could see a huge vast robust line of just lights from emergency vehicles of all sorts. [[03:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12341.5s)]
*  And then as it got closer to about 6 a.m. we saw fewer and fewer of those lights. But really a scene to behold here and I should note too just very quickly people are coming back to this airport to board flight. This airport officially opens back up for flights at 11 a.m. [[03:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12363.7s)]
*  All right. Caitlin Huey Burns thank you for those updates. [[03:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12381.34s)]
*  And CBS News congressional reporter Turing Small joins us now from Capitol Hill where there was a moment of silence this morning before some pretty key hearings got underway. So you've been listening in to this hearing for Trump's nomination for FBI director Cash Patel. Walk us through the big takeaways so far. [[03:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12384.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Democrats have been on Patel for his previous words. A lot of those they're saying are pretty controversial and do not make him qualify to lead the FBI. They're calling into question his loyalty to Trump and whether or not that could impact the bureau's independence from the president. [[03:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12404.099999999999s)]
*  Moving forward the idea behind that is they believe under a Trump era FBI it will be weaponized against his political opponents or enemies. Enemies was brought up quite a few times. Senator Dick Durbin the ranking member on this committee said that he believed that Patel has an enemies list as he said previously. [[03:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12422.38s)]
*  And he brought that up on top of going after some of other controversial things that he said. He referred to his association with far right figures including conspiracy theorists and then his association but also connection to January 6 rioters. [[03:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12444.34s)]
*  He questioned him on whether or not it was appropriate for him to have association with the families of people convicted and then ultimately in prison for their involvement in January 6 the January 6 riot on the U.S. Capitol. [[03:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12462.02s)]
*  As this hearing continues we're also hearing Republicans speak to the character of Patel giving him an opportunity to defend himself and clean up some of those statements oftentimes saying Democrats are taking them out of context. [[03:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12476.98s)]
*  Patel himself has pushed back on the idea that he associates himself with racist for example calling or saying recounting actually times where he was the victim of racist attacks himself. [[03:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12490.58s)]
*  As this continues we're expecting to see Democrats come forward and decry to their colleagues on the right that Patel in their minds have no business has no business being the top pick for Trump's next FBI head. [[03:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12503.539999999999s)]
*  And Torian it's also day two today of R.F.K. Junior's hearing as he seeks to be the head of health and human services for the country. We saw what happened yesterday. It does appear he has sort of sweeping Republican support. [[03:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12519.699999999999s)]
*  Will he have enough support to clinch this nomination. [[03:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12534.1s)]
*  Potentially yes there are some holdouts who are usual suspects when it comes to these more controversial picks. Susan Collins of Maine who is a part of the Senate Health Committee which is holding the hearing today for Robert F. Kennedy Junior. [[03:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12537.859999999999s)]
*  She said that she has some questions that still need answers. She wouldn't disclose whether or not she will be voting for him. She's saying she's following her protocol of waiting until she listens in full to this hearing. [[03:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12551.699999999999s)]
*  But she has some questions that need answers. There's also Lisa McKowski of Alaska who's been noncommittal about her support for Robert F. Kennedy Junior. And then there's Mitch McConnell. He was the third defector when it came to Pete Hegeson's confirmation. [[03:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12564.42s)]
*  He previously talked about how he had issues or concerns around R.F.K.'s association with people who look to repeal the polio vaccine. So these are three people that were watching. But that math there Chanel still would mean that Republicans would have a simple majority. [[03:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12580.66s)]
*  If the vice president J.D. Vance comes down steps into his role as the president of the Senate and cast that tie breaking vote for for Robert F. Kennedy Junior. [[03:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12599.3s)]
*  And finally one more key hearing we're watching closely is Tulsi Gabbard looking to be director of national intelligence. She is Trump's pick. Talk about her journey because a bit of an unconventional route to this nomination and what are her chances looking like today. [[03:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12609.38s)]
*  Yeah. Former Democrat former Democratic congresswoman then ran for president. She was then soured in her experience with the party ultimately defecting saying that she's an independent because of how she feels she was pushed out of the party by the establishment. [[03:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12623.779999999999s)]
*  She then went on to align herself with Donald Trump ultimately lending her an endorsement to Trump for 2024 and then joining him on the trail several times at major rallies and events hosting even fundraisers for the current president. [[03:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12640.02s)]
*  She's now looking to be the top national intelligence director and that's causing pause for not just Democrats but some Republicans. They're looking to question her and her association with some controversial political figures abroad including the ousted Syrian president Assad. [[03:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12655.46s)]
*  Whether or not she'll respond to concerns and credit criticism from Democrats about that association whether or not that could be a conflict of interest in this role if she is to be confirmed Chanel. [[03:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12673.859999999999s)]

*  Hi everyone. Welcome back. I'm Chanel call and for Vladimir Dutier right now we're following some breaking news that of Washington D.C. Any moment now we expect to hear from U.S. President Donald Trump about that tragic mid air crash of a passenger jet and Blackhawk helicopter that happened overnight in Washington D.C. So here's what we know so far. Crews were told are still on the ground searching more than 12 hours later. [[03:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12904.42s)]
*  Although this now has been classified as a recovery mission with the expectation that no one involved could have survived at this hour. Reagan International Airport where that flight is headed was headed is now back open a short time ago. We heard from the secretary of defense who said in a video message that the crew of that army helicopter were equipped with night vision technology at the time of this crash and called them quote fairly experienced. It was already going to be a [[03:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12934.42s)]
*  very busy day for the commander in chief as some of the most controversial cabinet picks including his would be FBI chief and director of national intelligence are on Capitol Hill right now as we speak for their highly anticipated confirmation hearings and things are already getting heated. All right. For more on all of this spring in CBS News senior national security correspondent Charlie Daggett. Charlie let's start with those comments from Pete Hegsat came in just about an hour ago now and this was supposed to be a briefing turned into a video message. [[03:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12964.42s)]
*  That was posted online. Walk us through the big takeaways especially what he said about the experience level of the people on board. Yeah that's right. We were all sort of beckoned to go to the briefing room here at the Pentagon just down the hallway from me at around nine thirty and then it was called off pretty quickly because we were told that the defense secretary had to make his way to the White House to brief the president about these very same things as you touched on fairly experienced. There's been a lot of question about this. [[03:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=12994.42s)]
*  The age the rank etc. He wouldn't divulge any of that he said because there are still next of kin issues involved. We weren't even even able to ascertain a rank the night vision goggles. Yes they did have night vision goggles. We don't know yet whether they were actually using the night vision goggles. [[03:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13024.42s)]
*  He did point out and we've been pointing out this morning we've been calling it a training mission because that's what the army had originally referred to it as. But it was an annual proficiency training flight. So it's an annual test that pilots do. So it wouldn't be unique to have crews in a Blackhawk helicopter that are running up and down the Potomac all day and night to be doing these training missions. [[03:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13042.54s)]
*  Even at night now there might be some question as he had pointed out he said we should be able to determine whether the aircraft was in the right corridor. Obviously that's important. And the right altitude the company that it was with which is Bravo Company 12th Aviation Battalion that has been essentially grounded for 48 hours. They've got a no fly for 48 hours while they look into it. I can also report that the army has its own sort of internal investigation in such a way that it's [[03:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13072.54s)]
*  able to determine whether the aircraft was in the right corridor. So it's a very interesting thing to see. And I think that's what the military personnel across Washington so the nature of the proficiency test flying in D.C. at night next to Reagan is exactly the kind of training that they would have. They would have had to have been tested on. [[03:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13132.54s)]

*  I think that's a very interesting thing to see. [[03:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13220.54s)]
*  I think that's a very interesting thing to see. [[03:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13222.54s)]

*  I think that's a very interesting thing to see. [[03:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13226.54s)]

*  I think that's a very interesting thing to see. [[03:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13232.54s)]
*  I think that's a very interesting thing to see. [[03:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13234.54s)]
*  Whether a rotary aircraft, a military rotary aircraft, [[03:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13236.54s)]
*  has something called the traffic collision avoidance systems, [[03:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13240.54s)]
*  that is something that is standard on civilian aircraft [[03:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13244.54s)]
*  and has been for decades. [[03:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13248.54s)]
*  Whether or not that would have helped, [[03:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13250.54s)]
*  or whether it would have helped with situational awareness, [[03:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13252.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13254.54s)]
*  This is going to be a long investigation. [[03:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13256.54s)]
*  The Army is doing what they can to determine [[03:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13258.54s)]
*  and work with the NTSB to determine exactly what happened. [[03:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13260.54s)]
*  And as Secretary Hegset himself said, [[03:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13264.54s)]
*  we have to determine whether that aircraft [[03:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13266.54s)]
*  is in the right corridor and at the right altitude. [[03:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13268.54s)]
*  That's critical as to what happened. [[03:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13271.54s)]
*  Charlie, I want to ask more about that communication piece, [[03:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13273.54s)]
*  because I think there's so many questions about that right now. [[03:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13276.54s)]
*  And many people may not be familiar with what's normal, [[03:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13279.54s)]
*  what's normal communication between an Army aircraft [[03:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13283.54s)]
*  and air traffic control. [[03:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13286.54s)]
*  And then we keep hearing this thing about seek and avoid, [[03:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13288.54s)]
*  this seek and avoid system. [[03:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13290.54s)]
*  Can you walk us through what normal communication would look like? [[03:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13292.54s)]
*  Well, so, as I understand it, [[03:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13295.54s)]
*  the way it works in a metropolitan area like this, [[03:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13299.54s)]
*  there are other cities and other towns [[03:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13303.54s)]
*  that have a relatively high concentration [[03:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13307.54s)]
*  of military aircraft flying around. [[03:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13312.54s)]
*  But this is sort of unique. [[03:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13314.54s)]
*  One, in the location of Reagan National itself, [[03:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13316.54s)]
*  and for those who haven't been here, [[03:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13320.54s)]
*  it's about five minutes, genuinely five minutes, from the Pentagon. [[03:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13322.54s)]
*  They overfly the Pentagon on their landing approach. [[03:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13326.54s)]
*  They come down the Potomac. [[03:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13330.54s)]
*  But this is obviously a very heavily congested area [[03:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13332.54s)]
*  in terms of U.S. military aircraft. [[03:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13336.54s)]
*  As I said, Blackhawks are flying up and down the Potomac all the time. [[03:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13339.54s)]
*  You have Marine One, Marine Two, the President's aircraft [[03:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13343.54s)]
*  that are flying around the same location at the same time. [[03:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13347.54s)]
*  So when it comes to coordination, that goes through the tower. [[03:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13351.54s)]
*  They have communications with one another. [[03:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13354.54s)]
*  Obviously, they have communications with their own bases. [[03:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13357.54s)]
*  This would have been part of that training [[03:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13359.54s)]
*  and part of that proficiency test. [[03:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13361.54s)]
*  It's exactly what they would have been testing for. [[03:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13364.54s)]
*  But ultimately, once they get close to Reagan National [[03:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13367.54s)]
*  and you've got civilian aircraft on approach, [[03:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13371.54s)]
*  then it becomes the tower's responsibility [[03:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13374.54s)]
*  to make sure that everybody's aware of that. [[03:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13376.54s)]
*  They should be aware that there are aircraft in the air. [[03:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13378.54s)]
*  They have different systems to do that, [[03:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13381.54s)]
*  but they also have to have eyes on. [[03:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13383.54s)]
*  Some important contacts there. [[03:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13385.54s)]
*  Charlie Daggett, thank you. [[03:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13387.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13388.54s)]
*  All right, now I want to bring in CBS News [[03:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13389.54s)]
*  Homeland Security correspondent Nicole Skanga. [[03:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13391.54s)]
*  She is at Reagan National Airport, which just minutes ago reopened. [[03:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13393.54s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[03:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13399.54s)]
*  And actually, we are just starting to see across from me. [[03:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13401.54s)]
*  There's a window, if I can paint a picture for our viewers, [[03:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13404.54s)]
*  and we are just starting to see the first commercial flights land. [[03:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13407.54s)]
*  We're here in Terminal 1. [[03:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13411.54s)]
*  We've been watching as a Southwest flight just landed moments ago. [[03:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13412.54s)]
*  And it's been fascinating to see the airport really transform [[03:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13417.54s)]
*  over the past 14 hours. [[03:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13421.54s)]
*  I've been here for 14 hours initially at a standstill, [[03:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13423.54s)]
*  and we saw the monitors, the screens turn red [[03:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13427.54s)]
*  as there were confused, frustrated, very upset, frankly, [[03:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13430.54s)]
*  travelers here at the airport, eventually those clearing out. [[03:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13436.54s)]
*  We know that at least 15 planes were grounded last night in addition [[03:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13440.54s)]
*  to 19 that were diverted to nearby Dulles Airport, [[03:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13444.54s)]
*  but now can confirm that operations are fully up and running. [[03:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13448.54s)]
*  We've been speaking with some travelers who have trickled in, [[03:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13453.54s)]
*  asking, are you concerned? [[03:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13455.54s)]
*  Are you nervous? [[03:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13457.54s)]
*  We've gotten sort of mixed responses. [[03:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13458.54s)]
*  Some folks understandably shaken by some of the video [[03:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13460.54s)]
*  that they saw surface overnight, others confident [[03:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13464.54s)]
*  that they will travel safely today. [[03:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13468.54s)]
*  And of course, both myself and my colleagues have pressed the D.C. [[03:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13471.54s)]
*  mayor, the secretary of transportation, lawmakers to say, you know, [[03:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13475.54s)]
*  can the American public feel confident heading on a plane today? [[03:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13481.54s)]
*  And everyone has resoundingly responded. [[03:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13485.54s)]
*  Yes, the FAA feels confident. [[03:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13488.54s)]
*  There's been a lot of coordination in terms of law enforcement [[03:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13491.54s)]
*  and first responders on the ground today. [[03:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13495.54s)]
*  But as for Terminals one and Terminals two, just saw another [[03:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13498.54s)]
*  Southwest flight take off. [[03:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13501.54s)]
*  It is business as usual, at least on this side of the airport. [[03:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13503.54s)]
*  And Nicole, you know, you spoke to D.C.'s mayor just about half an hour ago [[03:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13507.54s)]
*  live here on CBS News 24 seven. [[03:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13511.54s)]
*  And she was talking about the kinds of support available to families [[03:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13513.54s)]
*  of the victims walk us through what is going to be offered. [[03:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13517.54s)]
*  Yeah, and really American Airlines is leading much of this. [[03:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13521.54s)]
*  So they've actually stood up a bit of a resource center in Terminal two [[03:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13525.54s)]
*  that's across from where we are now, where it's serving as a place [[03:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13530.54s)]
*  where families can gather. [[03:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13534.54s)]
*  They have resources available to them. [[03:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13536.54s)]
*  There are counselors on standby and American, you know, [[03:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13538.54s)]
*  offering many services to those families. [[03:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13542.54s)]
*  Of course, the mayor saying that, you know, the whole city is behind [[03:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13544.54s)]
*  these individuals. [[03:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13547.54s)]
*  We heard lawmakers, both senators from Virginia as well as local [[03:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13548.54s)]
*  congressmen say their offices are open for any families that need [[03:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13554.54s)]
*  assistance or guidance during this time. [[03:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13558.54s)]
*  Earlier this morning, about two press conferences ago, we also saw both [[03:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13561.54s)]
*  senators from Kansas. [[03:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13565.54s)]
*  They had rushed to Reagan National Airport to try to comfort some of the [[03:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13567.54s)]
*  families that were here and waiting. [[03:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13571.54s)]
*  Of course, our affiliate speaking to one individual who was waiting for [[03:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13574.54s)]
*  his wife who said he had received a text message just 20 minutes before [[03:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13578.54s)]
*  the flight was meant to land. [[03:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13583.54s)]
*  And so some very heartbreaking stories emerging. [[03:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13585.54s)]
*  We're still learning more about the victims. [[03:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13587.54s)]
*  But certainly there is an effort here to really try to lift up these [[03:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13589.54s)]
*  families as much as possible. [[03:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13594.54s)]
*  It's interesting, I think, in the next few days, and we've talked about [[03:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13596.54s)]
*  this a little bit on 24-7, there are going to be a number of questions [[03:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13600.54s)]
*  that lawmakers pose, a number of questions for the NTSB, which is the [[03:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13604.54s)]
*  lead investigative agency here about what went wrong. [[03:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13609.54s)]
*  But today the feeling is really trying to bolster and support these [[03:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13613.54s)]
*  families as much as possible, focus on the victims, find out more about [[03:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13619.54s)]
*  them and offer what guidance can be offered or what love can be offered [[03:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13624.54s)]
*  quite frankly to their loved ones. [[03:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13629.54s)]
*  That being said, Washington, D.C., certainly a city and this certainly an [[03:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13631.54s)]
*  airport, DCA here, many lawmakers in and out of this airport. [[03:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13636.54s)]
*  Certainly that was something senators spoke about today, many of them [[03:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13640.54s)]
*  sitting on committees of commerce and transportation. [[03:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13644.54s)]
*  There are going to be some serious questions, some that we've raised during [[03:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13647.54s)]
*  our segments today regarding the communication failures, the apparent lack [[03:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13651.54s)]
*  of coordination here, but today the feeling very much of focus here on the [[03:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13656.54s)]
*  airport on lifting some of these families up. [[03:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13661.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's an important point, Nicole, where this happened. [[03:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13664.54s)]
*  This is a historic tragedy but also happened at an airport that is so [[03:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13667.54s)]
*  central to the work of national lawmakers and frequented, as you said, by [[03:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13671.54s)]
*  so many. [[03:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13676.54s)]
*  What does that say about national security? [[03:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13678.54s)]
*  We're hearing from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem today. [[03:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13680.54s)]
*  Yeah, we are hearing from the secretary and certainly the U.S. [[03:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13684.54s)]
*  Coast Guard, which sits under the Department of Homeland Security, [[03:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13689.54s)]
*  surged resources here in the early morning hours and late last night. [[03:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13692.54s)]
*  There were several vessels that came from nearby, Station Washington and [[03:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13697.54s)]
*  Station State Inigo, and so lots of DHS personnel on the ground just walking [[03:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13703.54s)]
*  around the airport. [[03:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13708.54s)]
*  It's very apparent that there is a real robust presence of TSA, a federal [[03:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13709.54s)]
*  protective service, of other law enforcement agencies that fall under the [[03:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13714.54s)]
*  Department of Homeland Security. [[03:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13718.54s)]
*  So certainly we can feel that presence here on the ground. [[03:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13720.54s)]
*  But as you point out, and the mayor actually spoke with us about this, [[03:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13724.54s)]
*  Washington, D.C. has a very unique airspace. [[03:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13728.54s)]
*  There are federal assets here, clearly, as was the case last night with this [[03:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13731.54s)]
*  Black Hawk Army helicopter. [[03:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13735.54s)]
*  And that does make it look a little different than some other cities, some [[03:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13737.54s)]
*  other airspaces above other cities in the United States. [[03:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13741.54s)]
*  Certainly going to be a crucial part of this investigation. [[03:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13744.54s)]
*  She raised several questions about where the helicopter was supposed to be and [[03:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13747.54s)]
*  what authorities, you know, a DOD helicopter would need versus a private [[03:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13751.54s)]
*  commercial helicopter, perhaps something that the NTSB will be looking into [[03:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13757.54s)]
*  today. [[03:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13761.54s)]
*  I did think it was very interesting during our press conference earlier today. [[03:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13763.54s)]
*  The secretary of transportation was asked, similar to what President Trump had [[03:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13769.54s)]
*  said earlier, was this preventable? [[03:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13775.54s)]
*  And he responded, you know, without hesitation, he feels this was preventable. [[03:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13777.54s)]
*  So I know we're awaiting remarks by the president. [[03:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13782.54s)]
*  It will be interesting to see if he sort of goes back to that point. [[03:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13786.54s)]
*  Certainly there are going to be a number of lessons learned in the coming days [[03:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13790.54s)]
*  and weeks. [[03:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13794.54s)]
*  But officials here, you know, despite being cautious about what they're [[03:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13796.54s)]
*  letting us into in terms of the investigation, seem to think that this [[03:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13799.54s)]
*  tragedy could have been prevented. [[03:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13803.54s)]
*  All right. [[03:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13805.54s)]
*  Nicole Skanga for us live inside the airport. [[03:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13807.54s)]
*  As Nicole mentioned, we are hopefully just moments away from hearing from [[03:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13809.54s)]
*  President Donald Trump at that White House press briefing. [[03:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13812.54s)]
*  That was supposed to start at 11 o'clock. [[03:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13817.54s)]
*  It looks like they're a bit delayed. [[03:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13819.54s)]
*  We'll bring you there as soon as that begins. [[03:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13820.54s)]
*  Stay with us here on CBS News 24 7. [[03:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13822.54s)]
*  I believe they are. [[03:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13849.54s)]
*  Then that will screw up America as a whole quite quickly. [[03:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13850.54s)]
*  I think I asked direct questions. [[03:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13879.54s)]
*  I don't know that they're tough questions per se. [[03:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13881.54s)]
*  What price should Moscow pay for the new [[03:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13883.54s)]
*  It was almost like being face to face with the devil. [[03:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13906.78s)]
*  Women riding bicycles dismembered. [[03:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13908.78s)]
*  She just vanished. [[03:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13909.78s)]
*  48 hours reports. [[03:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13910.78s)]
*  I thought and five. [[03:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=13911.78s)]

*  We continue to follow breaking news. [[03:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14008.14s)]
*  Any moment now we expect to hear from President Donald Trump about that tragic midair collision [[03:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14009.14s)]
*  of a passenger jet and Black Hawk helicopter in Washington, D.C. [[03:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14010.14s)]
*  So here's a look at what happened. [[03:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14011.14s)]
*  The [[03:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14012.14s)]
*  plane was on the ground. [[03:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14025.66s)]
*  They're searching more than 12 hours later, although this now has been classified as a [[03:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14026.66s)]
*  recovery mission with the expectation that no one involved could have survived. [[03:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14027.66s)]
*  At this hour, Reagan National Airport, where that flight was headed, is now back open. [[03:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14028.66s)]
*  Senator Tim Kaine of Washington, D.C., has been called in to discuss the situation. [[03:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14029.66s)]

*  One of the key aspects of the FAA reauthorization bill that Congress did last spring was to [[03:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14203.66s)]
*  increase the number of air traffic controllers because we were concerned that as a nation [[03:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14209.66s)]
*  we didn't have enough. [[03:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14214.74s)]
*  Again, I don't know whether that played any part here. [[03:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14215.74s)]
*  You did hear communication that has now been made public between the tower and the Hilo [[03:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14218.34s)]
*  where the Hilo acknowledges the presence of the plane, but beyond that we just can't [[03:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14224.58s)]
*  say anything right now. [[03:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14229.32s)]
*  You know, there's all this technical stuff and these questions about what happened. [[03:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14231.82s)]
*  There's also so much of emotion in this. [[03:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14235.22s)]
*  There's a human side of this. [[03:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14238.3s)]
*  The first thing I thought is the people who were here at Reagan Airport, your constituents, [[03:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14239.3s)]
*  they were moments away from what they thought was going to be a reunion with loved ones. [[03:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14243.8s)]
*  Have you been able to meet with any of those families yet? [[03:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14247.82s)]
*  What have they told you? [[03:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14250.46s)]
*  How are they doing? [[03:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14251.46s)]
*  Not yet. [[03:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14252.46s)]
*  Let's take you now to a CBS News special report. [[03:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14255.46s)]
*  This is a CBS News special report. [[03:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14257.82s)]
*  We're going to take you live right now to the Brady briefing room in the White House [[03:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14259.54s)]
*  where we just caught a glimpse of President Donald Trump. [[03:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14264.02s)]
*  We expect to hear his first remarks on this tragedy over the Potomac. [[03:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14267.1s)]
*  Let's listen in. [[03:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14271.380000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14284.060000000001s)]
*  I speak to you this morning in an hour of anguish for our nation. [[03:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14290.54s)]
*  Just before 9 p.m. last night, an American Airlines regional jet carrying 60 passengers [[03:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14297.18s)]
*  and four crew collided with an Army Black Hawk helicopter carrying three military service [[03:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14302.580000000002s)]
*  members over the Potomac River in Washington, D.C., while on final approach to Reagan National [[03:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14308.42s)]
*  Airport. [[03:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14315.140000000001s)]
*  Both aircraft crashed instantly and were immediately submerged into the icy waters [[03:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14316.54s)]
*  of the Potomac. [[03:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14321.300000000001s)]
*  Real tragedy. [[03:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14323.18s)]
*  The massive search and rescue mission was underway throughout the night, leveraging [[03:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14324.900000000001s)]
*  every asset at our disposal and I have to say the local, state, federal, military, [[03:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14329.52s)]
*  including the United States Coast Guard in particular, they've done a phenomenal job. [[03:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14336.02s)]
*  So quick, so fast. [[03:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14341.460000000001s)]
*  It was mobilized immediately. [[03:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14343.140000000001s)]
*  The work has now shifted to a recovery mission. [[03:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14346.74s)]
*  Sadly, there are no survivors. [[03:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14351.58s)]
*  This was a dark and excruciating night in our nation's capital and in our nation's [[03:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14355.5s)]
*  history and a tragedy of terrible proportions. [[03:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14360.26s)]
*  As one nation, we grieve for every precious soul that has been taken from us so suddenly [[03:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14365.06s)]
*  and we are a country of, really we are in mourning. [[03:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14372.78s)]
*  This is really shaking a lot of people, including people very sadly from other nations who were [[03:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14377.1s)]
*  on the flight. [[03:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14382.98s)]
*  For the family members back in Wichita, Kansas, here in Washington, D.C., and throughout [[03:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14384.82s)]
*  the United States and in Russia, we have a Russia contingent, some very talented people. [[03:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14389.42s)]
*  Unfortunately, we're on that plane. [[03:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14396.86s)]
*  Very, very, very sorry about that. [[03:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14398.66s)]
*  Whose loved ones were aboard the passenger jet, we can only begin to imagine the agony [[04:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14401.02s)]
*  that you're all feeling. [[04:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14406.54s)]
*  Nothing worse. [[04:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14408.82s)]
*  On behalf of the First Lady, myself, and 340 million Americans, our hearts are shattered [[04:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14410.9s)]
*  alongside yours and our prayers are with you now. [[04:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14415.46s)]
*  And in the days to come, we'll be working very, very diligently in the days to come. [[04:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14419.3s)]
*  We're here for you to wipe away the tears and to offer you our devotion, our love, [[04:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14424.1s)]
*  and our support. [[04:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14428.98s)]
*  There's great support. [[04:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14429.98s)]
*  In moments like this, the differences between Americans fade to nothing compared to the [[04:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14432.140000000001s)]
*  bonds of affection and loyalty that unite us all, both as Americans and even as nations. [[04:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14437.74s)]
*  We are one family and today we are all heartbroken. [[04:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14444.5s)]
*  We're all searching for answers. [[04:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14448.26s)]
*  That icy, icy Potomac, that was a cold, cold night, cold water. [[04:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14452.140000000001s)]
*  We're all overcome with the grief for many who have so tragically perished will no longer [[04:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14458.820000000002s)]
*  be with us. [[04:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14463.900000000001s)]
*  Together we take solace in the knowledge that their journey ended not in the cold waters [[04:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14465.78s)]
*  of the Potomac, but in the warm embrace of a loving God. [[04:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14469.86s)]
*  We do not know what led to this crash, but we have some very strong opinions and ideas, [[04:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14474.26s)]
*  and I think we'll probably state those opinions now. [[04:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14480.26s)]
*  Because over the years I've watched as things like this happen and they say, well, we're [[04:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14483.06s)]
*  always investigating, and then the investigation three years later they announce it. [[04:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14487.66s)]
*  We think we have some pretty good ideas, but we'll find out how this disaster occurred [[04:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14491.58s)]
*  and we'll ensure that nothing like this ever happens again. [[04:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14496.9s)]
*  The FAA and the NTSB and the U.S. military will be carrying out a systematic and comprehensive [[04:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14501.82s)]
*  investigation. [[04:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14508.54s)]
*  Our new Secretary of Transportation, Sean Duffy, is second day on the job when that [[04:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14509.54s)]
*  happened. [[04:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14516.94s)]
*  It's a rough one. [[04:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14517.94s)]
*  We'll be working tirelessly. [[04:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14521.02s)]
*  He's a great gentleman. [[04:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14522.02s)]
*  Our whole group is, these are great people, and they are working tirelessly to figure [[04:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14523.02s)]
*  out exactly what happened. [[04:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14528.98s)]
*  We will state certain opinions, however. [[04:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14531.5s)]
*  I'm also immediately appointing an acting commissioner to the FAA, Christopher Rochelieu, [[04:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14533.34s)]
*  a 22-year veteran of the agency, highly respected. [[04:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14540.34s)]
*  Christopher, thank you very much. [[04:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14544.26s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[04:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14547.02s)]
*  We must have only the highest standards for those who work in our aviation system. [[04:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14548.02s)]
*  I changed the Obama standards from very mediocre at best to extraordinary. [[04:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14552.22s)]
*  You remember that only the highest aptitude, they have to be the highest intellect and [[04:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14559.42s)]
*  psychologically superior people, were allowed to qualify for air traffic controllers. [[04:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14567.539999999999s)]
*  That was not so prior to getting there. [[04:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14574.619999999999s)]
*  When I arrived in 2016, I made that change very early on because I always felt this was [[04:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14577.98s)]
*  a job that, and other jobs too, but this was a job that had to be superior intelligence. [[04:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14583.58s)]
*  We didn't really have that and we had it. [[04:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14591.22s)]
*  Then when I left office and Biden took over, he changed them back to lower than ever before. [[04:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14594.06s)]
*  I put safety first. [[04:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14603.539999999999s)]
*  Obama, Biden, and the Democrats put policy first. [[04:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14605.06s)]
*  They put politics at a level that nobody's ever seen because this was the lowest level. [[04:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14608.86s)]
*  Their policy was horrible and their politics was even worse. [[04:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14617.62s)]
*  So as you know, last week, long before the crash, I signed an executive order restoring [[04:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14622.86s)]
*  our highest standards for air traffic controllers and other important jobs throughout the country. [[04:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14627.1s)]
*  So it was very interesting. [[04:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14632.7s)]
*  About a week ago, almost upon entering office, I signed something last week that was an executive [[04:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14634.54s)]
*  order, very powerful one, restoring the highest standards of air traffic controllers and others, [[04:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14645.1s)]
*  by the way. [[04:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14650.18s)]
*  Then my administration will set the highest possible bar for aviation safety. [[04:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14651.980000000001s)]
*  We have to have our smartest people. [[04:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14656.02s)]
*  It doesn't matter what they look like, how they speak, who they are. [[04:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14658.38s)]
*  It matters intellect, talent, the word talent. [[04:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14662.3s)]
*  They have to be talented, naturally talented geniuses. [[04:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14665.58s)]
*  You can't have regular people doing that job. [[04:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14669.58s)]
*  They won't be able to do it. [[04:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14672.66s)]
*  But we'll restore faith in American air travel. [[04:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14674.98s)]
*  I'll have more to say about that. [[04:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14677.42s)]
*  I do want to point out that various articles that appeared prior to my entering office, [[04:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14679.339999999998s)]
*  here's one. [[04:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14687.660000000002s)]
*  The FAA's diversity push includes focus on hiring people with severe intellectual and [[04:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14689.42s)]
*  psychiatric disabilities. [[04:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14695.62s)]
*  That is amazing. [[04:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14699.380000000001s)]
*  And then it says FAA says people with severe disabilities are most underrepresented segment [[04:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14700.86s)]
*  of the workforce. [[04:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14707.220000000001s)]
*  They want them in and they want them, they can be air traffic controllers. [[04:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14708.220000000001s)]
*  I don't think so. [[04:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14712.5s)]
*  This was on January 14th, so that was a week before I entered office. [[04:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14714.02s)]
*  They put a big push to put diversity into the FAA's program. [[04:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14720.58s)]
*  Then another article, the Federal Aviation Administration, this was before I got to office, [[04:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14726.94s)]
*  recently second term. [[04:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14735.220000000001s)]
*  The FAA is actively recruiting workers who suffer severe intellectual disabilities, psychiatric [[04:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14737.98s)]
*  problems and other mental and physical conditions under a diversity and inclusion hiring initiative [[04:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14745.539999999999s)]
*  spelled out on the agency's website. [[04:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14750.859999999999s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[04:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14754.02s)]
*  These are people that are, I mean, actually their lives are shortened because of the stress [[04:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14755.02s)]
*  that they have. [[04:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14762.1s)]
*  Brilliant people have to be in those positions. [[04:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14764.9s)]
*  And their lives are actually shortened, very substantially shortened because of the stress [[04:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14768.02s)]
*  where you have many, many planes coming into one target. [[04:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14772.42s)]
*  And you need a very special talent and a very special genius to be able to do it. [[04:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14776.539999999999s)]
*  Targeted disabilities are those disabilities that the federal government, as a matter [[04:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14783.1s)]
*  of policy, has identified for special emphasis in recruitment and hiring the FAA's website [[04:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14786.82s)]
*  states. [[04:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14792.619999999999s)]
*  They include hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, epilepsy, [[04:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14793.660000000002s)]
*  severe intellectual disability, psychiatric disability, and dwarfism all qualify for [[04:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14802.060000000001s)]
*  the position of a controller of airplanes pouring into our country, pouring into a little [[04:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14809.62s)]
*  spot, a little dot on the map, a little runway. [[04:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14816.660000000002s)]
*  The initiative is part of the FAA's diversity and inclusion hiring plan. [[04:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14821.62s)]
*  Think of that. [[04:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14826.1s)]
*  The initiative is part of the FAA's diversity and inclusion hiring plan, which says diversity [[04:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14827.1s)]
*  is integral to achieving FAA's mission of ensuring safe and efficient travel. [[04:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14832.78s)]
*  I don't think so. [[04:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14838.02s)]
*  I don't think so. [[04:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14839.02s)]
*  I think it's just the opposite. [[04:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14840.02s)]
*  The FAA website shows that the agency's guidance on diversity hiring were last updated on [[04:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14841.94s)]
*  March 23rd of 22. [[04:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14848.98s)]
*  They wanted to make it even more so. [[04:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14850.78s)]
*  And then I came in, and I assume maybe this is the reason, the FAA, which is overseen [[04:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14853.140000000001s)]
*  by Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a real winner. [[04:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14859.980000000001s)]
*  That guy's a real winner. [[04:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14864.060000000001s)]
*  Do you know how badly everything's run since he's run the Department of Transportation? [[04:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14865.060000000001s)]
*  He's a disaster. [[04:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14869.980000000001s)]
*  He was a disaster as a mayor. [[04:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14872.26s)]
*  He ran his city into the ground, and he's a disaster now. [[04:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14874.300000000001s)]
*  He's just got a good line of bullshit. [[04:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14878.3s)]
*  The Department of Transportation is government agency charged with regulating civil aviation. [[04:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14881.74s)]
*  Well, he runs it. [[04:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14887.58s)]
*  Forty-five thousand people, and he's run it right into the ground with his diversity. [[04:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14889.38s)]
*  So I had to say that it's terrible. [[04:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14894.699999999999s)]
*  Then it's a group within the FAA, another story, determined that the workforce was too [[04:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14898.619999999999s)]
*  white, that they had concerted efforts to get the administration to change that and [[04:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14904.4s)]
*  to change it immediately. [[04:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14912.16s)]
*  This was in the Obama administration just prior to my getting there. [[04:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14914.72s)]
*  And we took care of African Americans, Hispanic Americans. [[04:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14919.699999999999s)]
*  We took care of everybody at levels that nobody's ever seen before. [[04:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14923.34s)]
*  It's one of the reasons I won. [[04:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14926.72s)]
*  But they actually came out with a directive, too white. [[04:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14929.0s)]
*  We want the people that are competent. [[04:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14933.439999999999s)]
*  But now we mourn and we pray. [[04:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14936.64s)]
*  Would like to ask all Americans to join me in a moment of silence as we ask God to watch [[04:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14939.359999999999s)]
*  over those who have lost their lives and bring comfort to the loved ones. [[04:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14943.76s)]
*  I just want to say God bless everyone in this room. [[04:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14949.72s)]
*  This has been a terrible, very short period of time. [[04:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14952.64s)]
*  We'll get to the bottom of it. [[04:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14957.96s)]
*  So we all saw the same thing. [[04:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14960.119999999999s)]
*  We've seen it many times. [[04:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14962.4s)]
*  I've had the honor of hearing tapes. [[04:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14963.4s)]
*  Tapes are scary. [[04:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14968.0s)]
*  Very scary tapes. [[04:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14970.0s)]
*  You had a airliner coming in, American Airlines. [[04:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14972.76s)]
*  He was doing everything right. [[04:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14977.88s)]
*  He was on track. [[04:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14979.68s)]
*  He was the same track as everybody else that came in. [[04:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14980.68s)]
*  It's probably the same track as they've had for 25 years or more. [[04:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14982.84s)]
*  He's coming in the path. [[04:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14987.279999999999s)]
*  And for some reason, he had a helicopter that was at the same height, obviously when they [[04:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14989.8s)]
*  hit but pretty much the same height, and going at an angle that was unbelievably bad when [[04:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=14998.599999999999s)]
*  the air traffic controller said, do you see? [[04:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15006.88s)]
*  He's talking about, do you see him? [[04:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15010.72s)]
*  But there was very little time left when that was stated. [[04:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15013.439999999999s)]
*  And then also, he said, follow him in. [[04:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15016.68s)]
*  And then almost immediately after that, you know, seconds after that, there was the crash [[04:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15019.0s)]
*  that took place. [[04:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15025.56s)]
*  Well, you follow him in. [[04:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15026.56s)]
*  That means like everything's fine. [[04:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15027.800000000001s)]
*  Follow him in. [[04:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15029.56s)]
*  You had a pilot problem from the standpoint of the helicopter. [[04:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15032.960000000001s)]
*  I mean, because it was visual. [[04:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15038.12s)]
*  It was a very clear night. [[04:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15040.2s)]
*  It was cold but clear and clear as you could be. [[04:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15042.84s)]
*  The American Airlines plane had lights blazing. [[04:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15047.56s)]
*  They had all their landing lights on. [[04:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15051.92s)]
*  I could see it from the Kennedy Center tape. [[04:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15054.119999999999s)]
*  We had a tape up on the Kennedy Center that seems to be the primary. [[04:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15056.42s)]
*  That's why I'm sure we'll see other tapes because it's such an area where there are [[04:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15060.439999999999s)]
*  a lot of cameras, a lot of cameras looking up into the air, into space. [[04:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15064.64s)]
*  So we'll probably see many other shots of it before too much time goes by. [[04:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15070.08s)]
*  But we had a situation where you had a helicopter that had the ability to stop. [[04:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15074.92s)]
*  I have helicopters. [[04:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15082.28s)]
*  You can stop a helicopter very quickly. [[04:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15083.72s)]
*  It had the ability to go up or down. [[04:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15086.6s)]
*  It had the ability to turn. [[04:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15088.68s)]
*  And the turn it made was not the correct turn, obviously. [[04:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15092.36s)]
*  And it did somewhat the opposite of what it was told. [[04:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15097.44s)]
*  We don't know that that would have been the difference because the timing was so tight. [[04:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15101.44s)]
*  It was so, it was so little. [[04:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15104.96s)]
*  There was so little time to think. [[04:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15107.44s)]
*  But what you did have is you had vision. [[04:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15109.72s)]
*  The helicopter had vision of the plane because you had vision of it all the way, perfect [[04:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15112.76s)]
*  vision of it all the way from at Kennedy Center where the tape was taken. [[04:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15117.72s)]
*  And for some reason there weren't adjustments made. [[04:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15123.48s)]
*  You could have slowed down the helicopter substantially. [[04:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15127.359999999999s)]
*  You could have stopped the helicopter. [[04:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15129.88s)]
*  You could have gone up. [[04:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15131.279999999999s)]
*  You could have gone down. [[04:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15132.279999999999s)]
*  You could have gone straight up, straight down. [[04:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15133.279999999999s)]
*  You could have turned. [[04:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15134.759999999998s)]
*  You could have done a million different maneuvers. [[04:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15135.759999999998s)]
*  For some reason it just kept going and then made a slight turn at the very end. [[04:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15138.64s)]
*  And it was by that time it was too late. [[04:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15147.72s)]
*  They shouldn't have been at the same height because if it was at the same height you could [[04:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15151.64s)]
*  have gone under it or over it and nobody realized or they didn't say that it's at the same height. [[04:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15156.160000000002s)]
*  At the same height it still wouldn't have been great but you would have missed it by [[04:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15163.28s)]
*  quite a bit. [[04:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15166.62s)]
*  It could have been a thousand feet higher. [[04:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15167.62s)]
*  It could have been 200 feet lower. [[04:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15169.240000000002s)]
*  But it was exactly at the same height and somebody should have been able to point that [[04:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15171.68s)]
*  out. [[04:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15174.92s)]
*  So all of this is going to be studied but it just seems to me from a couple of words [[04:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15176.0s)]
*  that I like to use the words common sense. [[04:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15181.6s)]
*  Some really bad things happened and some things happened that shouldn't have happened. [[04:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15185.92s)]
*  So you had a helicopter going in identical direction. [[04:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15192.04s)]
*  You had a helicopter that was at the exact same height as somebody going in essentially [[04:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15197.48s)]
*  the opposite direction. [[04:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15202.0s)]
*  You had a plane that was following a track which is a track that every other plane followed [[04:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15204.4s)]
*  I don't imagine I know I've heard today that they might have been following the preceding [[04:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15209.96s)]
*  plane which was pretty close but not that close the preceding plane but you wouldn't [[04:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15214.439999999999s)]
*  have even been able to see that because of the direction that the helicopter was coming [[04:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15219.359999999999s)]
*  in at. [[04:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15223.039999999999s)]
*  So you had a confluence of bad decisions that were made and you have people that lost their [[04:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15224.039999999999s)]
*  lives violently lost their lives. [[04:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15233.679999999998s)]
*  We're going to take a few questions. [[04:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15238.96s)]
*  I'd like to ask our new Secretary of Transportation to say a few words. [[04:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15240.199999999999s)]
*  Sean Duffy is a great gentleman. [[04:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15244.599999999999s)]
*  Just started. [[04:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15246.56s)]
*  It's not your fault and I know you agree with me very strongly on intellect and even psychological [[04:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15248.039999999999s)]
*  well-being of the air traffic control. [[04:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15255.72s)]
*  It's such an important position and I think I can't emphasize stronger. [[04:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15258.24s)]
*  I changed it when I first ran in 2016. [[04:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15262.56s)]
*  I changed it. [[04:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15266.839999999998s)]
*  We had the highest standard that you could have and then they changed it back. [[04:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15268.12s)]
*  That was Biden to a standard you just I read it to you. [[04:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15274.240000000002s)]
*  That was from one of your papers. [[04:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15277.960000000001s)]
*  One of the people in this room actually wrote that and then I changed it back a few days [[04:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15280.480000000001s)]
*  ago and unfortunately that was we'll see. [[04:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15285.92s)]
*  We don't know that necessarily it's even the controllers fault. [[04:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15293.960000000001s)]
*  But one thing we do know there was a lot of vision and people should have been able to [[04:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15297.12s)]
*  see that you know at what point do you stop at what point you say wow that plane is getting [[04:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15300.52s)]
*  a little bit close. [[04:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15305.36s)]
*  So this is a tragedy that should not have happened. [[04:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15306.56s)]
*  Please sir. [[04:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15309.96s)]
*  Thank you Mr. President and I would just note the president's leadership has been remarkable [[04:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15310.96s)]
*  during this crisis. [[04:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15318.8s)]
*  We have had a whole of government response local state federal and when you see that [[04:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15319.8s)]
*  kind of cooperation it begins with the leadership in this body. [[04:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15326.36s)]
*  So thank you for that Mr. President. [[04:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15331.279999999999s)]
*  You make our jobs a lot easier. [[04:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15332.64s)]
*  You made an important point that when we deal with safety we can only accept the best and [[04:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15335.96s)]
*  the brightest in positions of safety that impact the lives of our loved ones our family [[04:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15342.6s)]
*  members and I think you make a really important point on that Mr. President. [[04:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15349.08s)]
*  That is the motto of your presidency. [[04:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15352.52s)]
*  The best and the brightest the most intelligent coming into these spaces. [[04:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15354.720000000001s)]
*  I want to take a moment and extend my condolences to the families of the loved ones. [[04:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15358.880000000001s)]
*  We commit to them that we are going to get to the bottom of this investigation not in [[04:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15364.800000000001s)]
*  three years not in four years but as quickly as possible with the NTSB who is here today [[04:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15370.36s)]
*  as well as the FAA. [[04:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15375.36s)]
*  What happened yesterday shouldn't have happened. [[04:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15377.44s)]
*  It should not have happened. [[04:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15380.44s)]
*  And when Americans take off in airplanes they should expect to land at their destination. [[04:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15382.36s)]
*  That didn't happen yesterday. [[04:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15388.68s)]
*  That's unacceptable. [[04:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15390.36s)]
*  And so we will not accept excuses. [[04:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15391.96s)]
*  We will not accept passing the buck. [[04:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15394.8s)]
*  We are going to take responsibility at the Department of Transportation and the FAA to [[04:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15399.16s)]
*  make sure we have the reforms that have been dictated by President Trump in place to make [[04:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15404.0s)]
*  sure that these mistakes do not happen again. [[04:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15408.84s)]
*  And again I want to thank you for your leadership Mr. President. [[04:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15412.4s)]
*  And I appreciate the confidence you placed in me. [[04:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15414.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15418.56s)]
*  Pete, would you like to say a few words? [[04:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15420.8s)]
*  Well thank you Mr. President. [[04:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15425.84s)]
*  Again I want to echo what the Transportation Secretary said about your leadership from [[04:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15427.6s)]
*  the moment we found out about this. [[04:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15431.88s)]
*  We were in contact with the White House trying to determine exactly what happened. [[04:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15433.48s)]
*  I would echo it as well. [[04:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15437.2s)]
*  No excuses. [[04:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15438.44s)]
*  We are going to get to the bottom of this. [[04:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15439.44s)]
*  We first and foremost from the Defense Department want to pass our condolences to the 64 souls [[04:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15442.48s)]
*  and their families that were affected by this. [[04:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15448.16s)]
*  Never should happen. [[04:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15451.36s)]
*  And certainly the three service members, the three soldiers, young captain, staff sergeant [[04:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15453.039999999999s)]
*  and CW2 Chief Warrant Officer. [[04:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15458.92s)]
*  Honor. [[04:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15461.16s)]
*  Routine annual retraining of night flights on a standard corridor for a continuity of [[04:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15462.16s)]
*  government mission. [[04:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15468.64s)]
*  The military does dangerous things. [[04:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15470.48s)]
*  It does routine things on the regular basis. [[04:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15471.96s)]
*  Tragically last night a mistake was made. [[04:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15475.0s)]
*  I think the President is right. [[04:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15477.519999999999s)]
*  There was some sort of an elevation issue that we have immediately begun investigating [[04:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15479.72s)]
*  at the DOD and Army level. [[04:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15485.0s)]
*  Army CID is on the ground investigating. [[04:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15487.279999999999s)]
*  Top tier aviation assets inside the DOD are investigating sir to get to the bottom of [[04:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15489.9s)]
*  it so that it does not happen again because it's absolutely unacceptable. [[04:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15494.96s)]
*  But I want to echo what the transportation secretary and you Mr. President said because [[04:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15498.56s)]
*  it pertains to the DOD as well. [[04:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15503.6s)]
*  We will have the best and brightest in every position possible. [[04:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15506.22s)]
*  As you said in your inaugural it is colorblind and merit based. [[04:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15510.039999999999s)]
*  The best leaders possible whether it's flying Blackhawks and flying airplanes, leading platoons [[04:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15514.92s)]
*  or in government. [[04:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15520.439999999999s)]
*  The era of DEI is gone at the Defense Department and we need the best and brightest whether [[04:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15522.119999999999s)]
*  it's in our air traffic control or whether it's in our generals or whether it's throughout [[04:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15528.32s)]
*  government. [[04:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15533.24s)]
*  So thank you for your leadership and courage on that sir and we'll stand by you on it. [[04:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15534.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[04:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15537.44s)]
*  Jay do you have a question? [[04:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15538.44s)]
*  Well thank you Mr. President for your leadership. [[04:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15543.6s)]
*  I just want to reemphasize something the President said and you've heard from the Secretary of [[04:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15545.76s)]
*  Transportation and of Defense. [[04:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15549.279999999999s)]
*  There really was a whole of government response. [[04:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15551.32s)]
*  We were all on the phone. [[04:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15552.98s)]
*  We were all communicating yesterday trying to get to the bottom of this immediately but [[04:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15553.98s)]
*  also try to communicate with the American people about what happened. [[04:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15557.2s)]
*  Something the President said that I think bears reemphasizing which is that when you [[04:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15561.52s)]
*  don't have the best standards in who you're hiring it means on the one hand you're not [[04:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15565.400000000001s)]
*  getting the best people in government but on the other hand it puts stresses on the [[04:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15570.44s)]
*  people who are already there. [[04:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15574.52s)]
*  And I think that is a core part of what President Trump is going to bring and has already brought [[04:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15576.480000000001s)]
*  to Washington DC is we want to hire the best people because we want the best people at [[04:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15581.12s)]
*  air traffic control and we want to make sure we have enough people at air traffic control [[04:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15585.7s)]
*  who are actually competent to do the job. [[04:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15589.740000000002s)]
*  If you go back to just some of the headlines over the past 10 years you have many hundreds [[04:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15592.02s)]
*  of people suing the government because they would like to be air traffic controllers but [[04:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15596.26s)]
*  they were turned away because of the color of their skin. [[04:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15599.7s)]
*  That policy ends under Donald Trump's leadership because safety is the first priority of our [[04:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15602.640000000001s)]
*  aviation industry. [[04:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15607.26s)]
*  Thank you Mr. President. [[04:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15608.26s)]
*  Mr. President, on DEI and the claims that you've made, are you saying this crash was [[04:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15610.26s)]
*  somehow caused and the result of diversity hiring and what evidence have you seen to [[04:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15615.9s)]
*  support these claims? [[04:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15621.62s)]
*  It just could have been. [[04:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15622.62s)]
*  We have a high standard. [[04:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15623.86s)]
*  We've had a much higher standard than anybody else and there are things where you have to [[04:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15625.14s)]
*  go by brain power, you have to go by psychological quality and psychological quality is a very [[04:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15630.06s)]
*  important element of it. [[04:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15637.76s)]
*  These are various very powerful tests that we put to use and they were terminated by [[04:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15639.14s)]
*  Biden and Biden went by a standard that's the exact opposite. [[04:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15643.099999999999s)]
*  So we don't know but we do know that you had two planes at the same level. [[04:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15647.859999999999s)]
*  You had a helicopter and a plane. [[04:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15651.38s)]
*  That shouldn't have happened and we'll see. [[04:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15653.66s)]
*  We're going to look into that and we're going to see but certainly for an air traffic [[04:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15656.38s)]
*  controller we want the brightest, the smartest, the sharpest. [[04:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15661.26s)]
*  We want somebody that's psychologically superior and that's what we're going to have. [[04:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15664.3s)]
*  Yeah, please go ahead. [[04:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15669.9s)]
*  Mr. President, you mentioned at the top of the briefing that there were several Russian [[04:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15672.9s)]
*  nationals on the flight. [[04:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15676.779999999999s)]
*  Will the US government be willing to facilitate the transfer of their remains considering [[04:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15679.22s)]
*  in fact there is no direct air travel between the two countries? [[04:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15685.66s)]
*  We've already been in contact with Russia and the answer is yes, we will facilitate. [[04:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15689.22s)]
*  Mr. President, please go ahead. [[04:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15693.58s)]
*  Thank you Mr. President. [[04:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15696.58s)]
*  The situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is getting worse. [[04:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15699.58s)]
*  Even though President John Lorenzo has been mediating the conflict between Rwanda and [[04:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15704.58s)]
*  the Democratic Republic of the Congo because he wants to bring peace and stability, the [[04:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15709.58s)]
*  situation is really bad right now. [[04:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15713.58s)]
*  I want to hear from Mr. President if you have any plan in the future to bring peace in the [[04:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15715.58s)]
*  Democratic Republic of the Congo. [[04:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15720.58s)]
*  There is going to be a question about Rwanda and it is a very serious problem, I agree, [[04:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15722.1s)]
*  but I don't think it's appropriate right now to talk about it, but it is a very serious [[04:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15725.1s)]
*  problem. [[04:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15729.1s)]
*  Mr. President, do you even yet know the names of the 67 people who were killed and you are [[04:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15730.1s)]
*  blaming Democrats and DEI policies and air traffic control and seemingly the member of [[04:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15735.1s)]
*  the US military who was flying that Black Hawk helicopter. [[04:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15740.1s)]
*  Don't you think you're getting ahead of the investigation right now? [[04:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15742.1s)]
*  No, I don't think so at all. [[04:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15745.1s)]
*  I don't think with the names of the people, you mean the names of the people that are [[04:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15746.1s)]
*  blaming the American Airlines, you think that's going to make a difference? [[04:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15750.62s)]
*  They are a group of people that have lost their lives. [[04:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15753.62s)]
*  If you want a list of the names, we can give you that. [[04:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15756.62s)]
*  We'll be giving that very soon. [[04:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15759.62s)]
*  We're in coordination with American Airlines. [[04:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15761.62s)]
*  We're in coordination very strongly, obviously, with the military, but I think that's not [[04:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15763.62s)]
*  a very smart question. [[04:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15767.62s)]
*  I'm surprised coming from you. [[04:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15769.62s)]
*  Please. [[04:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15771.62s)]
*  Thank you, President Trump. [[04:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15773.62s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[04:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15775.62s)]
*  I'm curious of who was at fault, if it was the plane, the helicopter, air traffic control, [[04:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15778.140000000001s)]
*  and can you assure people that it is safe to fly in and out of D.C.? [[04:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15782.140000000001s)]
*  Well, I've given you the analysis, and the analysis was based on vision. [[04:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15786.140000000001s)]
*  You had a lot of people that saw what was happening. [[04:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15792.140000000001s)]
*  You had some people that knew what was happening. [[04:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15796.140000000001s)]
*  There were some warnings, but the warnings were given very, very late. [[04:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15799.140000000001s)]
*  You know, those warnings were given very late. [[04:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15802.140000000001s)]
*  Almost as they were given a few seconds later, there was a crash. [[04:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15804.66s)]
*  It should have been brought up earlier. [[04:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15807.66s)]
*  But the people in the helicopter should have seen where they were going. [[04:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15811.66s)]
*  I can't imagine people with 20-20 vision not seeing, you know, what's happening up there. [[04:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15817.66s)]
*  Again, they shouldn't have been at the same height. [[04:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15825.66s)]
*  You're going in reverse directions or sideways directions. [[04:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15829.18s)]
*  Obviously, you want to be at different heights. [[04:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15833.18s)]
*  I see it all the time when I'm flying. [[04:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15835.18s)]
*  You have planes going in the opposite. [[04:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15837.18s)]
*  They're always lower. [[04:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15839.18s)]
*  We're higher. [[04:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15840.18s)]
*  So if somehow there's a screw-up, there's not going to be a tragedy. [[04:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15842.18s)]
*  It'll be close, but you know, there's never going to be a tragedy if you're at a different elevation. [[04:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15847.18s)]
*  For whatever reason, they were at the same elevation. [[04:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15851.18s)]
*  And also, from the American Airlines Center, he's along the track that every plane is along. [[04:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15854.7s)]
*  You say, what was the helicopter doing in that track? [[04:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15860.7s)]
*  It's very sad. [[04:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15865.7s)]
*  But visually, somebody should have been able to see and taken that helicopter at a play. [[04:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15866.7s)]
*  And they should have been at a different height. [[04:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15871.7s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[04:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15874.7s)]
*  You mentioned the Russians that were on board that plane. [[04:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15876.7s)]
*  What other nationalities were on board that passing through? [[04:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15879.7s)]
*  There were a couple of others. [[04:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15883.220000000001s)]
*  We're going to be announcing it in about an hour. [[04:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15884.220000000001s)]
*  We have some very specific information. [[04:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15886.220000000001s)]
*  We're calling the countries. [[04:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15889.220000000001s)]
*  We've spoken to most of them, but there were some other countries represented. [[04:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15890.220000000001s)]
*  Mr. President, have I spoken to President Putin? [[04:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15894.220000000001s)]
*  I have not, no. [[04:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15897.220000000001s)]
*  Not about this. [[04:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15899.220000000001s)]
*  On your executive order, you've already issued an executive order. [[04:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15901.220000000001s)]
*  You say, well, restore aviation safety. [[04:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15903.220000000001s)]
*  Right. [[04:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15905.220000000001s)]
*  This crash happened after that. [[04:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15906.220000000001s)]
*  Was the executive order successful? [[04:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15908.220000000001s)]
*  And what more need to change to keep people safe? [[04:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15910.220000000001s)]
*  You know, we issued it three days ago and we were in the process of making those changes. [[04:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15912.74s)]
*  This is something that should have been done a long time ago. [[04:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15916.74s)]
*  Actually, my original order should have never been changed. [[04:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15922.74s)]
*  And I think maybe you wouldn't have had this problem. [[04:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15924.74s)]
*  Maybe. [[04:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15926.74s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[04:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15928.74s)]
*  Go ahead. [[04:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15929.74s)]
*  Yes, thank you. [[04:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15930.74s)]
*  We see like everyday life that's very often the those diversity hires cause sometimes [[04:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15931.74s)]
*  issues, as you just mentioned. [[04:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15936.74s)]
*  So what plan do you have? [[04:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15938.74s)]
*  Are we going to see some fire? [[04:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15941.26s)]
*  Are you going to fire some of those diversity hires in the federal government? [[04:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15943.26s)]
*  What plan do you have? [[04:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15947.26s)]
*  I would say the answer is yes. [[04:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15949.26s)]
*  If we find that people aren't mentally competent, you see the language. [[04:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15951.26s)]
*  The language is put out by them. [[04:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15954.26s)]
*  And if you see that, I'm not going to bore you by reading it again, but these are not [[04:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15956.26s)]
*  people that should be doing this particular job. [[04:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15962.26s)]
*  They'd be very good for certain jobs, but not people that should be doing this particular job. [[04:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15965.26s)]
*  Mr. President, you have today blamed the diversity elements, but then told us that you weren't [[04:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15969.78s)]
*  sure that the controllers made any mistake. [[04:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15978.78s)]
*  You then said perhaps the helicopter pilots were the ones who made the mistake. [[04:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15981.78s)]
*  It's all under investigation. [[04:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15986.78s)]
*  I understand that. [[04:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15988.78s)]
*  That's why I'm trying to figure out how you can come to the conclusion right now that [[04:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15989.78s)]
*  diversity had something to do with this crash. [[04:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15993.78s)]
*  Because I have common sense. [[04:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15995.78s)]
*  Okay? [[04:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15998.300000000001s)]
*  And unfortunately, a lot of people don't. [[04:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=15999.300000000001s)]
*  We want brilliant people doing this. [[04:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16002.300000000001s)]
*  This is a major chess game at the highest level. [[04:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16004.300000000001s)]
*  When you have 60 planes coming in during a short period of time and they're all coming [[04:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16007.300000000001s)]
*  in different directions, and you're dealing with very high-level computer work and very [[04:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16013.300000000001s)]
*  complex computers. [[04:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16019.300000000001s)]
*  And one of the other things I will tell you is that the systems that were built, I was [[04:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16021.300000000001s)]
*  trying to rebuild the entire system, and then we had an election that didn't turn out the [[04:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16026.82s)]
*  way it should have. [[04:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16030.82s)]
*  But they didn't build the systems properly. [[04:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16032.32s)]
*  They spent a lot of money renovating a system, spending much more money than they would have [[04:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16034.82s)]
*  spent if they bought a new system for air traffic controllers, meaning the computerized [[04:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16039.32s)]
*  systems. [[04:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16044.32s)]
*  There are certain companies that do a very good job. [[04:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16045.32s)]
*  They didn't use those companies. [[04:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16047.32s)]
*  They used companies that should not have been doing it. [[04:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16048.72s)]
*  So I think it's very important to understand that for some jobs, and not only this, but [[04:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16052.14s)]
*  air traffic controllers, they have to be at the highest level of genius. [[04:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16057.14s)]
*  Okay. [[04:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16062.14s)]
*  I want to ask you about the ice skaters in a moment because the U.S. Ice Skating Committee [[04:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16063.14s)]
*  was affected. [[04:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16068.14s)]
*  But first, if I can, the cited FAA tax that you read is real, but the implication that [[04:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16069.14s)]
*  this policy is new or that it stems from efforts that began under President Biden or the Transportation [[04:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16073.14s)]
*  Secretary Pete Buttigieg is demonstrably false. [[04:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16078.14s)]
*  It's been on the FAA's website. [[04:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16081.56s)]
*  Who said that? [[04:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16082.56s)]
*  You? [[04:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16083.56s)]
*  No, it's on the website. [[04:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16084.56s)]
*  The FAA's website. [[04:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16085.56s)]
*  It was there in 2013. [[04:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16086.56s)]
*  It was there for the entirety. [[04:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16087.56s)]
*  Take what I read. [[04:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16088.56s)]
*  It was there for the entirety of your administration, too. [[04:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16089.56s)]
*  So my question is, why didn't you change the policy during your first administration? [[04:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16090.56s)]
*  I did change it. [[04:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16094.16s)]
*  I changed the Obama policy, and we had a very good policy. [[04:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16095.16s)]
*  And then Biden came in and he changed it. [[04:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16098.66s)]
*  And then when I came in, two days, three days ago, I signed a new order bringing it to [[04:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16101.08s)]
*  the highest level of intelligence. [[04:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16105.46s)]
*  Okay. [[04:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16107.46s)]
*  Please. [[04:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16108.779999999999s)]
*  Quiet. [[04:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16109.779999999999s)]
*  Quiet. [[04:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16110.779999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[04:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16111.779999999999s)]
*  Welcome back to the... [[04:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16112.779999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[04:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16113.779999999999s)]
*  You mentioned that a vision was probably the problem that was at issue in this crash. [[04:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16114.779999999999s)]
*  There's been some reports that one of the pilots in the helicopter may have been using [[04:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16120.38s)]
*  night vision equipment. [[04:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16124.259999999998s)]
*  Was there any indication? [[04:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16125.259999999998s)]
*  I heard that. [[04:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16126.259999999998s)]
*  We don't know. [[04:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16127.259999999998s)]
*  We're going to know that pretty soon. [[04:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16128.259999999998s)]
*  It may change your view plane if you do have the night vision. [[04:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16129.339999999998s)]
*  So it's very possible that could have happened. [[04:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16132.919999999998s)]
*  That would be maybe a reason why you wouldn't actually see as well as on a clear night. [[04:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16136.04s)]
*  You can see sometimes better without it. [[04:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16141.64s)]
*  Have a couple more. [[04:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16143.6s)]
*  Newsman. [[04:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16146.6s)]
*  Is it helpful to have your Secretary of Transportation confirmed, and does this intensify your interest [[04:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16147.6s)]
*  in getting other nominees confirmed quickly? [[04:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16152.6s)]
*  Can I go to what? [[04:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16154.6s)]
*  Is it helpful to have your Secretary of Transportation confirmed, and does this intensify your interest [[04:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16155.6s)]
*  in getting other nominees confirmed quickly as well? [[04:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16160.6s)]
*  Well, sure. [[04:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16162.6s)]
*  We want fast confirmations. [[04:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16163.6s)]
*  And the Democrats, as you know, are doing everything they can to delay them. [[04:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16165.0s)]
*  They've taken too long. [[04:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16169.2s)]
*  We're struggling to get very good people that everybody knows are going to be confirmed. [[04:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16171.2s)]
*  But we're struggling to get them out faster. [[04:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16177.0s)]
*  We want them out faster. [[04:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16180.12s)]
*  It's a good question, actually. [[04:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16181.12s)]
*  We've been pushing Sean. [[04:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16183.24s)]
*  Everyone knows Sean for a long time. [[04:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16185.8s)]
*  He got many, many Democrat votes, but they want to take as long as they can. [[04:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16188.0s)]
*  They ask questions like some of the questions that Peter would ask that were totally irrelevant [[04:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16192.0s)]
*  and not very good questions, but they want to just keep it going. [[04:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16197.68s)]
*  They want to keep it going as long as possible. [[04:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16200.64s)]
*  I was very honored, actually, that you got so many Democrat votes. [[04:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16202.52s)]
*  That was really good. [[04:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16206.36s)]
*  That was really good. [[04:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16207.36s)]
*  When I applied to meet with the families and second question, is it your impression that [[04:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16208.36s)]
*  little training that was done during that time? [[04:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16215.36s)]
*  The what? [[04:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16221.32s)]
*  The training that the helicopter was involved in. [[04:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16222.32s)]
*  Is it anything you can tell us about that? [[04:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16225.16s)]
*  You don't know. [[04:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16226.640000000001s)]
*  These are the things that will come up with the investigation. [[04:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16227.640000000001s)]
*  You don't know. [[04:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16229.880000000001s)]
*  But the helicopter obviously was in the wrong place at the wrong time and a tragedy occurred. [[04:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16230.880000000001s)]
*  Please. [[04:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16236.880000000001s)]
*  I've got a question about the... [[04:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16237.880000000001s)]
*  No, go ahead. [[04:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16239.880000000001s)]
*  Please. [[04:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16240.880000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[04:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16241.880000000001s)]
*  You've been critical of the current regulations and you've called for big reforms at FAA. [[04:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16242.880000000001s)]
*  I'm curious, sir, what is... [[04:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16250.4s)]
*  Well, I made the reforms. [[04:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16251.4s)]
*  What is your message... [[04:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16252.88s)]
*  Three days ago, I made the reforms. [[04:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16253.88s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[04:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16254.88s)]
*  What is your message then to the American public in the weeks and months ahead? [[04:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16255.88s)]
*  Should they feel hesitant to fly? [[04:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16257.759999999998s)]
*  And if you could clarify perhaps something that the Defense Secretary said when he said [[04:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16261.24s)]
*  that this helicopter was on a continuity of government mission? [[04:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16265.56s)]
*  I don't know what that refers to, but they were practicing. [[04:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16270.16s)]
*  They were. [[04:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16275.359999999999s)]
*  They do that. [[04:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16276.359999999999s)]
*  They call it practicing. [[04:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16277.359999999999s)]
*  And that's something that should be done. [[04:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16278.84s)]
*  It's only continuity in the sense that we want to have very good people and that has [[04:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16282.480000000001s)]
*  to be in continuity and that's what they refer to. [[04:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16286.04s)]
*  But it was basically practice and it was a practice that worked out very, very badly. [[04:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16290.16s)]
*  Okay? [[04:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16295.16s)]
*  Mr. President, on his question, the first question, should people be hesitant to fly [[04:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16296.16s)]
*  right now? [[04:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16305.08s)]
*  No, not at all. [[04:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16306.08s)]
*  I do not hesitate to fly. [[04:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16307.08s)]
*  This is something that it's been many years that something like this has happened and [[04:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16308.8s)]
*  the collision is just something that we don't expect ever to happen again. [[04:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16315.16s)]
*  We are going to have the highest level people we've already hired. [[04:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16320.28s)]
*  Some of the people that you've already hired for that position, long before we knew about [[04:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16324.84s)]
*  this, I mean long before, from the time I came in, we started going out and getting [[04:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16328.68s)]
*  the best people because I said it's not appropriate what they're doing. [[04:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16333.24s)]
*  I think it's a tremendous mistake. [[04:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16337.6s)]
*  You know, they like to do things and they like to take them too far and this is sometimes [[04:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16339.16s)]
*  what ends up happening. [[04:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16343.5s)]
*  Now with that, I'm not blaming the controller. [[04:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16344.5s)]
*  I'm saying there are things that you could question like the height of the helicopter [[04:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16348.640000000001s)]
*  and the height of the plane being at the same level and going in opposite directions. [[04:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16352.6s)]
*  It's not a positive. [[04:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16356.04s)]
*  But no, we're already hiring people. [[04:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16358.04s)]
*  No, flying is very safe. [[04:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16360.2s)]
*  We have the safest flying anywhere in the world and we'll keep it that way. [[04:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16361.800000000001s)]
*  Thank you all very much. [[04:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16365.28s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[04:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16367.76s)]
*  You have been watching a fairly high wattage press conference there in the Brady briefing [[04:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16374.84s)]
*  room with President Donald Trump, two cabinet secretaries and a brief appearance even from [[04:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16380.960000000001s)]
*  Vice President J.D. Vance. [[04:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16386.44s)]
*  The press conference began, as one might expect, with condolences and sorrow, words of comfort [[04:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16388.8s)]
*  to the families of the 67 people believed to be dead at this hour after that mid-air [[04:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16395.68s)]
*  collision. [[04:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16401.16s)]
*  And then the conversation turned, the president turned the conversation to what might have [[04:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16402.6s)]
*  happened, called it a confluence of bad decisions. [[04:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16407.32s)]
*  And then the bulk of the commentary was about diversity, equity and inclusion and an executive [[04:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16411.239999999998s)]
*  order that he signed a few days ago that he says corrected an FAA policy that was hiring [[04:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16418.04s)]
*  people who were not qualified to be air traffic controllers. [[04:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16424.46s)]
*  But then at another point, he said, didn't blame the air traffic controllers necessarily. [[04:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16427.579999999998s)]
*  And he seemed to in fact be blaming maybe the pilots of the Army helicopter. [[04:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16431.699999999997s)]
*  They were on the wrong path. [[04:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16436.14s)]
*  He said they should have seen. [[04:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16437.739999999998s)]
*  It wasn't really clear by the end, as I turned to our Ed O'Keefe here, who was listening [[04:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16439.739999999998s)]
*  along with me, what the president thought in a firm way was at fault at this hour. [[04:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16443.42s)]
*  He said it could have been. [[04:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16450.26s)]
*  He said he had common sense. [[04:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16452.5s)]
*  Didn't seem like he had firm conclusions, Ed. [[04:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16454.5s)]
*  No, Tony, he seemed to be jumping to conclusions before an investigation begins saying I'm [[04:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16457.5s)]
*  going to express my opinions knowing that it could take several years for an investigation [[04:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16463.699999999997s)]
*  to be completed. [[04:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16468.179999999997s)]
*  Let's convey two pieces of information he shared. [[04:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16469.179999999997s)]
*  First, he assured the flying public they should fly. [[04:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16471.179999999997s)]
*  Second, that there will be a quote systematic investigation led by the FAA, the National [[04:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16474.26s)]
*  Transportation Safety Board, the Defense Department to review what went on. [[04:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16478.42s)]
*  And he did name an acting administrator at the Federal Aviation Administration, a guy [[04:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16482.42s)]
*  named Chris Rocholo, a 22-year veteran who had been serving in a sort of active or acting [[04:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16485.859999999997s)]
*  role over the last several weeks because the then administrator and deputy quit earlier [[04:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16491.3s)]
*  this month ahead of the Trump inauguration, knowing they'd probably lose their job anyway. [[04:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16495.98s)]
*  But this focus on diversity, equity, inclusion programs is part of a big revamp of the federal [[04:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16500.739999999998s)]
*  policy and federal government that's underway, going into agencies and saying if you've got [[04:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16506.9s)]
*  any of these programs, they're being canceled. [[04:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16510.98s)]
*  The people that run them are being put on paid leave for now, believing that across [[04:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16513.22s)]
*  the federal government there's been too much focus on those kinds of issues and not on [[04:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16517.02s)]

*  Whether he's inferring here that somebody was in fact hired through that program is [[04:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16524.7s)]
*  unclear, but he's at least using that as one scapegoat in the early hours of this investigation. [[04:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16529.100000000002s)]
*  Tony? [[04:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16534.100000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it certainly sounded that way, Ed. [[04:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16535.739999999998s)]
*  You know, I'm reminded of the fact that from 2009, the last deadly crash like this, to [[04:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16537.94s)]
*  this one, you had four different presidents who oversaw a remarkable stretch of safety [[04:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16542.3s)]
*  in the skies. [[04:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16548.1s)]
*  They shared leadership during that time. [[04:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16549.1s)]
*  Now it seems like President Trump wants to put the blame on Biden and Obama, as he put [[04:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16552.14s)]
*  it in this remarkable press conference. [[04:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16557.059999999998s)]

*  this tragedy over the Potomac. [[04:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16564.82s)]
*  Last night's midair collision between a regional jet and an army helicopter, he said it's an [[04:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16567.62s)]
*  hour of anguish for our nation. [[04:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16571.579999999998s)]
*  And sadly, he reiterated, there are no known survivors. [[04:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16573.62s)]
*  Trump promised investigators will find out how this disaster occurred. [[04:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16577.9s)]
*  And our coverage of this tragedy will continue on CBS mornings, your local news, and also, [[04:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16582.3s)]

*  moment. But first, can you talk a little bit about what's happening there at the [[04:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16923.46s)]
*  airport? We know it just reopened to the public. Walk us through what you're [[04:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16927.22s)]
*  seeing there on the ground. [[04:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16930.420000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's great to be with you. This airport just reopened to the public. You [[04:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16934.18s)]
*  can see people wheeling their suitcases behind me and heading off to their [[04:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16938.100000000002s)]
*  flights. This is significant because this airport shut down soon after that [[04:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16943.14s)]
*  crash just before nine p.m. Last night, we arrived here at two in the morning [[04:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16949.100000000002s)]
*  to a completely empty shut down airport except for the families of those [[04:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16955.14s)]
*  who they lost in the crash the night before they gathered in an American [[04:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16962.94s)]
*  Airlines lounge inside this airport to meet with officials and be together. We [[04:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16969.66s)]
*  encountered one woman around three a.m. Who arrived here at the airport looking [[04:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16976.92s)]
*  for any news about her friend who she found out was on that flight. So very [[04:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16982.420000000002s)]
*  somber morning here and into these early hours. And that's when we found [[04:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16989.1s)]
*  out to that official said that there were no survivors here. But everything [[04:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16994.3s)]
*  has moved on at least technically here at this airport. I talked to one [[04:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=16998.82s)]
*  gentleman who was confident about boarding his flight. He was actually [[04:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17003.58s)]
*  Wichita originally. He was heading to the area as well today, not concerned [[04:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17008.3s)]
*  about safety. And that has been the line coming from officials as well that [[04:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17014.7s)]
*  this shouldn't have happened, but that consumers flyers Americans around the [[04:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17019.46s)]
*  country should still be confident that the planes they're boarding are safe. [[04:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17025.66s)]
*  And Caitlin, as we mentioned, this is now turned into a recovery mission. [[04:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17032.66s)]
*  They don't anticipate finding any survivors. What more can you tell us [[04:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17036.22s)]
*  about the next steps, though, in the investigation into why this happened? [[04:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17040.260000000002s)]
*  Yeah, well, this investigation now moves into the purview of the NTSB. Um, and [[04:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17045.78s)]
*  we don't know yet how long that investigation will take. Yesterday [[04:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17050.94s)]
*  after this crash just before nine p.m. Good 300 first responders at the scene. [[04:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17055.74s)]
*  When I was here in the wee hours of the morning, you could see all of the [[04:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17063.66s)]
*  bright lights from those first responders vehicles. Um, then several [[04:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17067.38s)]
*  hours later, fewer and fewer of them. We know that the commercial aircraft [[04:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17072.02s)]
*  that American Airlines plane when it hit the water, it broke into three pieces. [[04:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17077.920000000002s)]
*  And so that is part of the investigation as well. Divers have [[04:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17084.02s)]
*  been there. The recovery effort is well underway here and has been on. They're [[04:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17089.54s)]
*  waiting to see official counts of what they have. Um, uh, so far. But as we [[04:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17095.5s)]
*  mentioned, officials say there were no survivors here. Lots and lots of [[04:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17103.42s)]
*  questions remain about how this could have happened. Officials note that the [[04:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17108.3s)]
*  pattern of this commercial aircraft and the idea that there was a military [[04:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17113.74s)]
*  aircraft is completely normal. That happens all the time. So what was the [[04:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17119.18s)]
*  miscommunication perhaps or what went wrong? No one has at least the public [[04:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17125.02s)]
*  answers to that yet. Yeah, it was interesting because Caitlin in the [[04:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17130.18s)]
*  press conference that President Trump just gave, he suggested that the blame [[04:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17133.34s)]
*  of all this should be placed on the helicopter pilots and he also cited D [[04:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17137.699999999997s)]
*  I policies. Is there evidently evidence that we that you know of or that [[04:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17142.16s)]
*  officials know of that points to that being the reason for this crash? [[04:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17147.02s)]
*  Well, that was the first time we had heard it. And actually when he was asked [[04:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17152.66s)]
*  in a follow up, what is the evidence? Do you have any evidence that D E I [[04:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17156.100000000002s)]
*  policies are to blame? The president said he didn't know, but he thinks it [[04:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17159.98s)]
*  could have been now a little bit of context here at least to explain those [[04:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17165.420000000002s)]
*  comments. Remember when the president took office just last week, some of the [[04:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17171.5s)]
*  first executive orders that he signed were to revoke D E I programs at [[04:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17175.94s)]
*  various levels. And you heard from other officials at that press conference, his [[04:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17181.3s)]
*  defense secretary, his vice president, his secretary of transportation who [[04:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17185.76s)]
*  just started this job yesterday after being sworn in all echoed that [[04:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17192.5s)]
*  sentiment as well. So there is no answer to that. And the president himself [[04:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17196.82s)]
*  acknowledged that he does not have evidence for that at this point. I want [[04:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17202.38s)]
*  to go back to the victims who were on board this tragic flight. Caitlin, we [[04:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17206.9s)]
*  understand an ice skating club from Boston lost several members of their [[04:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17210.84s)]
*  team in this collision. What more do we know about that? And you also mentioned [[04:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17215.22s)]
*  that there's some Russian nationals that were on this flight. [[04:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17219.300000000003s)]
*  Yeah, also part of that U. S skating Federation. This was a group that had [[04:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17223.98s)]
*  been competing in Wichita and had been making their way back here to [[04:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17231.64s)]
*  Washington. We're still waiting, of course, for official names. But we do [[04:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17237.64s)]
*  know from U. S ice skating that they did have team members on that flight. [[04:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17242.88s)]
*  Unfortunately, there is a lot left to be known about who else was on that [[04:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17248.8s)]
*  flight. You heard from lawmakers here in Virginia, where this airport actually [[04:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17254.84s)]
*  is just at the border of D. C. Um, you know, some members from this area and [[04:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17259.72s)]
*  across the country. So as we're waiting to hear more about the victims here, we [[04:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17265.68s)]
*  know that their families were notified last night, many of them here at this [[04:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17270.78s)]
*  airport also looking for answers. Of course, that is all at the heart of [[04:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17275.8s)]
*  this. Those lost souls in this horrific collision. That is really a tragedy [[04:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17280.32s)]
*  here in Washington. Oh, my goodness. Absolutely, Caitlin. And we also heard [[04:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17287.04s)]
*  from passengers in Washington where that were at the airport at the time of the [[04:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17290.96s)]
*  crash. They witnessed it. We want to play some of that sound for you and [[04:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17295.64s)]
*  then talk on the other side. [[04:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17298.96s)]
*  I'm sure they're going through just horror. I can't imagine how terrible [[04:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17301.0s)]
*  that is. The chances of playing crash are so rare that you hear about these [[04:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17305.28s)]
*  things a lot these days and where in the olden days you didn't hear about [[04:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17310.8s)]
*  the stuff because news didn't travel so fast. So, uh, you know, you gotta gotta [[04:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17314.04s)]
*  think that our chances are pretty good getting on a plane this morning. We were [[04:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17318.2s)]
*  in the middle of the air while the pilot said that there is a tragic incident [[04:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17321.42s)]
*  happened in the D. C. Airport. They could not land. We were scared. We were [[04:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17328.04s)]
*  shocked. We are all kids and everybody's like, you know, what happened? [[04:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17332.28s)]
*  What happened in our prayers and thoughts are with the families and [[04:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17337.0s)]
*  everybody who's involved in that incident. You can only imagine the shock [[04:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17340.24s)]
*  and sadness and disbelief that those people who are watching this unfold [[04:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17344.7s)]
*  right from their eyes. We understand passengers now face a number of delays [[04:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17348.760000000002s)]
*  and cancellation. So how is this accident and investigation impacting [[04:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17352.920000000002s)]
*  air travel across the country right now? [[04:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17357.320000000003s)]
*  Well, it's a good question. And this particular airport was adamant about [[04:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17361.84s)]
*  reopening and continuing those flights and that partly, you know, sent the [[04:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17366.08s)]
*  message to Americans that it is still safe to fly. And we heard that from [[04:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17370.46s)]
*  officials as well. But I can tell you specifically about this airport. This [[04:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17374.760000000002s)]
*  is a highly trafficked airport. This is also a very frequent stop for [[04:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17378.54s)]
*  lawmakers in Washington coming from here back to their home districts and [[04:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17383.72s)]
*  back to their states. Typically on a Thursday here, you see lots of [[04:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17387.82s)]
*  lawmakers trying to catch last minute flight back to their home states and [[04:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17391.4s)]
*  districts. And so this is a highly trafficked airport, but it is also [[04:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17395.88s)]
*  very small compared to this city. And what we've heard from lawmakers for [[04:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17400.52s)]
*  a while now is concern about congestion here. Too many flights taking off and [[04:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17407.120000000003s)]
*  too many flights coming in. That is a concern that predated this this awful [[04:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17412.440000000002s)]
*  tragedy. But this has been on the top of some lawmakers minds as they've [[04:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17419.280000000002s)]
*  been conducting oversight of the FAA. And that's another important thing to [[04:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17424.600000000002s)]
*  note here is that Trump did announce made some news just now saying that he [[04:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17429.2s)]
*  has appointed an acting director, an acting administrator of the FAA. That's [[04:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17433.4s)]
*  significant because that position has been vacant for several weeks as the [[04:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17438.48s)]
*  previous administrator resigned before this administration took office. This is [[04:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17442.420000000002s)]
*  not a political position. Really, it is a five year term, and that's meant to [[04:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17447.52s)]
*  extend beyond a president's term so as not to be political. And so having that [[04:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17452.32s)]
*  position now is significant given that it is vacant. But there are going to be [[04:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17457.64s)]
*  so many questions from lawmakers on Capitol Hill, especially with how well [[04:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17462.44s)]
*  acquainted they are with this airport and again wanting to get that message [[04:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17466.719999999998s)]
*  to Americans across the country about safety when it comes to the air. [[04:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17470.039999999997s)]
*  Caitlin, he reburns from Reagan National Airport. Caitlin, thank you so [[04:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17474.96s)]
*  much for that report. Meanwhile, let's listen to more of what the president had [[04:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17478.36s)]
*  to say about this crash from the White House briefing room earlier this morning. [[04:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17482.52s)]
*  Take a listen. [[04:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17486.239999999998s)]
*  We do not know what led to this crash, but we have some very strong opinions [[04:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17488.06s)]
*  and ideas, and I think we'll probably state those opinions now. My changed [[04:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17493.44s)]
*  the Obama standards from very mediocre at best to extraordinary. You remember [[04:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17498.44s)]
*  that only the highest aptitude have to be the highest intellect and psychologically [[04:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17504.420000000002s)]
*  superior people were allowed to qualify for air traffic controllers. That was [[04:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17512.98s)]
*  not so prior to getting there. When I arrived in 2016, I made that change [[04:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17519.34s)]
*  very early on because I always felt this was a job that and other jobs too. [[04:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17525.9s)]
*  But this was a job that had to be superior intelligence. [[04:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17530.14s)]
*  Now, the president also said that he believes D E I policies played a role [[04:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17535.02s)]
*  in this. Take a listen to that. I signed something last week that was an [[04:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17539.06s)]
*  executive order, very powerful on restoring the highest standards of air [[04:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17545.22s)]
*  traffic controllers and others, by the way, then my administration will set [[04:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17548.38s)]
*  the highest possible bar for aviation safety. We have to have our smartest [[04:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17553.9s)]
*  people. It doesn't matter what they look like, how they speak, who they are. [[04:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17557.82s)]
*  It matters intellect talent. The word talent. You have to be talented, [[04:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17562.86s)]
*  naturally talented geniuses. [[04:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17567.66s)]
*  You can't have regular people doing that job. They won't be able to do it, [[04:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17571.06s)]
*  but will restore faith in American air travel. I'll have more to say about that. [[04:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17575.42s)]
*  I do want to point out that various articles that appeared prior to my [[04:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17579.86s)]
*  entering office and here's one. The F A A s diversity push includes focus on [[04:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17586.38s)]
*  hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities. [[04:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17592.98s)]
*  That is amazing. And then it says F A A. All right, let's bring in C B s [[04:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17599.74s)]
*  News senior White House and political correspondent at O'Keefe. And thank you [[04:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17605.02s)]
*  for being with us. Has there been any reaction yet to the president's comments [[04:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17608.52s)]
*  during this press press conference about D E I policies playing a role in this? [[04:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17612.9s)]
*  Well, Elizabeth, it wrapped up at the top of the hour, so it's hard to know. [[04:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17618.5s)]
*  But what he's what he's doing there in essence, and he said he was gonna do [[04:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17622.02s)]
*  this was he's he's jumping to conclusions before an investigation is [[04:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17625.82s)]
*  even underway. And he said, I'm going to do that because he didn't essentially [[04:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17629.7s)]
*  want to have to wait several years until the investigation is over. And [[04:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17633.62s)]
*  what he's doing is essentially drawing attention to a series of steps he's [[04:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17636.54s)]
*  taken since he became president about nine days ago that are designed to end [[04:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17641.46s)]
*  curtail stop funding all sorts of programs in the realm of diversity, [[04:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17646.46s)]
*  equity inclusion that he says have permeated the federal government [[04:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17650.739999999998s)]
*  needlessly over the last several years and taken the eye of those agencies [[04:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17654.94s)]
*  and departments off of their primary mission, which in the case of the F A A [[04:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17659.14s)]
*  is safety, which in the case of all the others is up for debate. He would not [[04:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17662.7s)]
*  say he was asked and also kind of avoided questions about whether he was [[04:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17666.98s)]
*  seeing something specific in who was involved in this, either in the air [[04:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17671.26s)]
*  traffic control tower or aboard either of the aircraft that would suggest that [[04:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17675.579999999998s)]
*  somebody in this was hired under one of those programs or is a minority or [[04:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17679.78s)]
*  something else. But that appeared to be what he was inferring and then began to [[04:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17686.62s)]
*  back off of it throughout the news conference, suggesting instead that, [[04:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17690.219999999998s)]
*  look, mistakes were made. We'll have an investigation. We should put out a few [[04:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17693.739999999998s)]
*  things. He said there will be a systematic investigation involving the [[04:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17697.06s)]
*  FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board, which we're expecting to hold its [[04:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17701.34s)]
*  first news briefing in about 90 minutes or so and the Defense Department and [[04:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17705.3s)]
*  then proceeded to sort of engage in what has been a years, if not decades long [[04:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17710.14s)]
*  debate across parties and presidencies about whether the nation skies are safe [[04:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17715.9s)]
*  enough and whether those that ensure that they are have the manpower and [[04:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17721.38s)]
*  equipment needed to avoid situations like this one. We've heard, of course, [[04:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17725.42s)]
*  for the last several years, Elizabeth, about close calls on runways from coast [[04:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17729.739999999998s)]
*  to coast and the concern that air traffic controllers are distracted or [[04:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17733.46s)]
*  not getting enough time off in between shifts to avoid this kind of mistake and [[04:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17738.14s)]
*  to ensure that pilot training, both civilian and military, is proper so that [[04:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17742.739999999998s)]
*  this kind of thing is avoided. What he didn't talk about, but the Defense [[04:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17747.019999999997s)]
*  Secretary did, is the idea that perhaps there are, not the idea, the reality is [[04:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17751.42s)]
*  that there are multiple military operations that go on over the skies of [[04:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17756.5s)]
*  Washington at the same time that commercial aircraft is coming and going [[04:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17761.26s)]
*  from Reagan National Airport. If you live here in Washington, it is not uncommon [[04:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17765.539999999997s)]
*  on weekends and late at night, once the sun goes down, to hear low-flying [[04:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17769.899999999998s)]
*  helicopters over your neighborhoods and often people think, well, what happened? [[04:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17774.42s)]
*  Are they looking for someone? You look up and you realize, oh, it's another Coast [[04:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17778.14s)]
*  Guard helicopter or it's a military helicopter and they're doing those low [[04:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17780.78s)]
*  altitude training missions that they do because they like to use the Potomac [[04:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17784.579999999998s)]
*  River, which cuts between Virginia and DC, and kind of come up the banks of that [[04:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17788.579999999998s)]
*  river to the northwest over Georgetown and Georgetown University and then up [[04:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17793.3s)]
*  into suburban Maryland, circle around and then head back down the river at low [[04:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17797.42s)]
*  altitude while planes are landing and coming and going from from from DCA. So [[04:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17801.379999999997s)]
*  that's part of what may have gone on here. In fact, this morning, the [[04:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17806.18s)]
*  president's nominee for secretary of the Army conceded to senators during a [[04:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17809.66s)]
*  confirmation hearing that perhaps they're going to have to reconsider [[04:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17813.02s)]
*  holding military exercises at that low altitude over the skies of Washington if [[04:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17815.7s)]
*  it interferes with civilian commercial aircraft coming and going from that [[04:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17820.9s)]
*  large airport. And what Caitlin was saying, it is a small place, it is popular [[04:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17824.78s)]
*  with a lot of people who want to be able to get in and out of Washington easily, [[04:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17829.02s)]
*  but you've also got multiple military bases, the Coast Guard, the local and [[04:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17831.5s)]
*  state police running those low altitude operations and that may have been [[04:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17835.62s)]
*  part of the problem here. Whether D. I. Had anything to do with it is absolutely [[04:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17839.7s)]
*  unclear at this point, but the president went there and suggested that the moves [[04:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17843.58s)]
*  he's been making in recent days, controversial disruptive as he promised [[04:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17847.7s)]
*  may be helping solve this mistake that was was so tragic and deadly over the [[04:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17852.54s)]
*  skies of Washington last night. Yeah, it's important important to keep [[04:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17858.54s)]
*  repeating that that we still don't know exactly what led up to this mistake. The [[04:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17862.22s)]
*  investigation is ongoing. I want to talk though about the victims. We understand [[04:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17866.06s)]
*  that there excuse me that there were some Russian nationals on that flight. [[04:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17870.98s)]
*  Can you go over what the president said and how he plans to handle the victims [[04:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17874.66s)]
*  families in this? [[04:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17878.46s)]
*  He can. He confirmed that Russian nationals were on the flight. We had [[04:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17880.78s)]
*  heard from an ice skating association and the U. S. Figure skating [[04:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17884.46s)]
*  association that in fact a number of passengers aboard the plane were coming [[04:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17888.66s)]
*  from Wichita from training sessions that were held with younger skaters in the [[04:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17893.5s)]
*  days after a figure skating championship that was held there over last weekend. [[04:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17898.62s)]
*  He said that the U. S. Government has been in touch with the Russian government [[04:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17903.7s)]
*  about getting the Russian nationals back to Russia. Should they? Should that be [[04:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17907.1s)]
*  their ultimate resting place? And he also confirmed that there were nationals from [[04:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17910.5s)]
*  other countries, but he wouldn't say which ones and that information about [[04:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17914.46s)]
*  that would be coming later. Notably during the briefing, he was asked, Have [[04:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17917.34s)]
*  you talked to President Putin about this? And he very sort of brushed it aside [[04:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17921.06s)]
*  and said quickly, No, I hadn't talked to him. Not about that. So what's unclear [[04:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17925.620000000003s)]
*  is whether in fact there's been a conversation at all since he became [[04:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17930.420000000002s)]
*  president between Trump and Putin, or if he's referring to something that's not [[04:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17933.22s)]
*  yet been confirmed that may have happened during the transition, or the [[04:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17937.780000000002s)]
*  two of them may have spoken. This has been one of the more intriguing aspects [[04:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17941.06s)]
*  of his new presidency is to what extent is he in touch with the Russian leader? [[04:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17944.620000000003s)]
*  He may have just inadvertently told us there that there has been a [[04:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17948.34s)]
*  conversation that had not been officially read out. So as often happens [[04:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17951.18s)]
*  when he speaks, he's established a series of new questions that we're [[04:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17955.379999999997s)]
*  gonna have to answer and introduced a concept that was not necessarily on the [[04:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17959.78s)]
*  minds of those monitoring the aftermath of this by suggesting that personnel [[04:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17964.019999999997s)]
*  policy across the federal government may have been to blame. Elizabeth. [[04:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17968.739999999998s)]
*  All right. CBS News, Senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe. [[04:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17972.44s)]
*  Thank you so much for being with us. All right, so let's take a look at these [[04:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17975.5s)]
*  two aircrafts involved in this tragic collision on the left, a standard PSA [[04:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17979.059999999998s)]
*  Airlines CRJ series jet. It holds up to 78 people. This one held 60 passengers [[04:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17983.7s)]
*  and four crew members. Now at the time of the crash, three soldiers on board [[04:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17990.78s)]
*  the Black Hawk helicopter in a video, newly appointed Department of Defense [[04:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17995.7s)]
*  Secretary Pete Hegseth said they were taking part in a standard military [[04:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=17999.739999999998s)]
*  training flight. Take a listen. [[05:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18003.98s)]
*  It was an annual proficiency training flight. And when we look at the crew and [[05:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18006.78s)]
*  we're not not all kin have been notified. So we're gonna withhold ranks [[05:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18011.18s)]
*  and names at this point. We do know on our side who was involved. It was a [[05:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18015.219999999998s)]
*  fairly experienced crew on that was doing a required annual night evaluation. [[05:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18021.199999999997s)]
*  They did have night vision goggles. [[05:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18027.14s)]
*  All right, I want to get right to CBS News Senior National Security [[05:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18030.86s)]
*  correspondent Charlie Dagata. Charlie, thank you for being here. Something to [[05:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18033.82s)]
*  note their night vision goggles. Are you hearing that there's any reason to [[05:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18037.62s)]
*  believe that those types of goggles could have played a role in all this? [[05:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18041.66s)]
*  Well, no. First of all, Elizabeth, it was confirmed by actually by officials [[05:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18048.06s)]
*  that we spoke to before we heard from Secretary Hegseth that they were [[05:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18051.66s)]
*  equipped with these night vision goggles. It raises a couple of questions that [[05:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18056.58s)]
*  we're hoping to find out this afternoon as to whether or not that would have [[05:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18060.420000000002s)]
*  helped the situation and helped their vision. That's not necessarily a slam [[05:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18063.86s)]
*  dunk because night vision goggles in a built up urban area can be very [[05:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18068.7s)]
*  distracting. I mean, I've worn them myself. I've used them myself. They give [[05:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18072.5s)]
*  us sort of greenish hue to things. And as we've already established, it was a [[05:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18076.54s)]
*  clear night last night and you've got an aircraft on approach. So whether or not [[05:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18080.54s)]
*  you'd have to use night goggles to identify that aircraft is the question [[05:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18084.78s)]
*  we'll try to find the answer to. Another part of that, you heard the Secretary [[05:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18090.1s)]
*  say this was a training program. Like part of that training and part of that [[05:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18094.66s)]
*  yearly assessment. And it's not necessarily training assessment training [[05:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18098.1s)]
*  as we would know it, but the annual proficiency training flight. So this is [[05:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18102.1s)]
*  really a sort of review. And as part of that review, as I understand it, that [[05:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18107.62s)]
*  would include not only using night vision goggles, but not using night [[05:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18112.5s)]
*  vision goggles as part of that training review. But it was something that [[05:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18117.54s)]
*  President Trump brought up as well. And he said that it may not have helped. [[05:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18121.5s)]
*  And I just have to point out a couple of things. You know, this is early on in [[05:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18126.22s)]
*  this investigation. Arguably, it hasn't even begun yet. Yet there was a lot of [[05:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18129.14s)]
*  I'll use the word blame heaped on the helicopter pilot. So he called it a [[05:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18134.02s)]
*  confluence of bad decisions. He said it was a pilot problem, referring to the [[05:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18139.58s)]
*  helicopter pilot. He called the angle and the path of the helicopter [[05:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18144.58s)]
*  unbelievably bad. The helicopter had the ability to stop go up, down or turn. [[05:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18148.620000000003s)]
*  Helicopter had clear vision of the plane adjustments weren't made. They shouldn't [[05:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18153.7s)]
*  have been at the same height. That's self evident. That's something also that [[05:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18158.02s)]
*  Secretary Hedgeseth brought up, he referred to it as an elevation issue. And [[05:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18163.38s)]
*  that pre tape statement, he didn't want to name rank. We could do that now. We [[05:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18168.54s)]
*  don't have the names of the people. Young captain, staff sergeant, chief warrant [[05:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18172.34s)]
*  officer. What's kind of interesting there is normally in a Black Hawk [[05:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18176.3s)]
*  helicopter, you'd have a crew of four. So that's just once again, it's it's two [[05:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18179.9s)]
*  more eyes that weren't in the cockpit of that helicopter when that incident [[05:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18184.82s)]
*  happened. You know, Ed brought up this point again, as did Caitlin, that these [[05:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18191.1s)]
*  types of annual night evaluations, this is very routine. This is something that [[05:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18195.54s)]
*  people who live in the area who around that area are used to hearing at night. [[05:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18200.16s)]
*  I mean, how often is this going on? Is this something that happens year round? [[05:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18204.44s)]
*  Different pilots come in and go through these evaluations? [[05:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18207.98s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Elizabeth, I just moved here right maybe seven months ago from [[05:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18212.24s)]
*  overseas. I was astonished at the amount of activity from these helicopters [[05:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18215.94s)]
*  because I was listening to Ed's report there. Yeah, I mean, I live in [[05:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18220.06s)]
*  Georgetown. It happens all the time. It's it is not uncommon to see a couple [[05:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18222.94s)]
*  of Black Hawk helicopters or more or Marine one going up and down the [[05:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18229.239999999998s)]
*  Potomac and in the vicinity of the airport. Now, it has already been raised [[05:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18233.46s)]
*  that maybe that's not the best place to have those drills. But the other [[05:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18239.699999999997s)]
*  argument is you need to have those drills because that's exactly the [[05:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18245.18s)]
*  environment that those helicopter pilots and crew are operating in. They are [[05:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18248.06s)]
*  responsible for transportation of personnel and troops in and out of and [[05:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18253.34s)]
*  around the D. C. Metropolitan area. So it would stand to reason that any [[05:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18259.260000000002s)]
*  training scheme would have at least an element of focus on there. But those are [[05:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18263.5s)]
*  the questions that are going to come up now about the wisdom of having these [[05:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18267.66s)]
*  annual annual training reviews around a heavily trafficked and I can't underline [[05:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18271.82s)]
*  that enough a heavily trafficked Metropolitan Airport, which is right [[05:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18280.3s)]
*  downtown. It's less than 10 minutes from the Pentagon. You fly right over the [[05:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18284.62s)]
*  Pentagon when you fly into into Reagan National as anybody's been here knows. [[05:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18288.579999999998s)]
*  It's I was astonished by it. Yeah, it's high profile as well. And Charlie, [[05:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18293.66s)]
*  before you go, I want to get to more of this recovery and investigation. You [[05:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18299.18s)]
*  know, they're still recovering victims of this crash over 60 civilians, three [[05:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18303.14s)]
*  military service members. I'm curious, how does the military handle this kind of [[05:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18307.22s)]
*  recovery effort and investigation? What role are they playing right now? Right? [[05:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18311.58s)]
*  So it is a mammoth task. We had been reporting overnight. I was at the [[05:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18316.58s)]
*  Potomac overnight after this had happened. I got there. So we had 300 [[05:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18321.38s)]
*  first responders, and that was a sort of multi state effort. But yes, Secretary [[05:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18325.94s)]
*  Hegseth said that army CID army investigators would be part of this [[05:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18331.579999999998s)]
*  investigation because normally they have their own department that would [[05:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18337.7s)]
*  investigate if there is a military aircraft, in this case, an army aircraft [[05:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18341.739999999998s)]
*  that has been involved in a mishap, an accident, an incident, what have you, [[05:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18347.54s)]
*  where it sometimes where it blurs a little bit. And they made clear here is [[05:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18351.74s)]
*  this will be driven by the NTSB. So this will be to augment some of that [[05:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18356.32s)]
*  investigation. Highly skilled investigators will be working with the [[05:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18362.260000000002s)]
*  NTSB and the FAA and trying to determine exactly what happened. But they'll want [[05:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18365.98s)]
*  to know if the helicopter and crew are to blame or for whatever reason again, [[05:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18370.66s)]
*  this elevation seems to be the biggest problem. And again, that's self evident. [[05:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18376.3s)]
*  They'll want to determine whether those the aircraft and the crew were flying [[05:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18381.34s)]
*  within that permitted envelope and therefore should have been out of harm's [[05:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18385.66s)]

*  It's going to take some time, but we're still seeing a very, very large and [[05:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18782.940000000002s)]

*  where we are standing. I spoke to one lift driver. He says that his friend [[05:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18805.02s)]

*  plane. As we've been reporting, members of the figure skating community were [[05:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18823.02s)]

*  devastating reality for many people in the figure skating community, a very [[05:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18849.98s)]

*  question that we all share and that many people are thinking, how could [[05:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18866.86s)]

*  know, traveling on a plane is the safest or one of the safest forms of [[05:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18874.64s)]

*  domino effect when you had the airport closed for several hours overnight. [[05:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=18924.5s)]

*  what it's like to land a plane at that airport? [[05:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=19296.58s)]
*  Yes, many times. It's very busy airspace. In this case, we have a lot of [[05:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=19299.420000000002s)]
*  different types of aviation, military, airlines, corporate and it's very [[05:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=19304.34s)]
*  sensitive airspace because of the location and of course the need to [[05:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=19309.940000000002s)]
*  protect the capital in this case. So we heard these 13 seconds of between the [[05:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=19314.3s)]
*  air traffic control and the pilots on the pilot of that plane. And those 13 [[05:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=19320.06s)]
*  seconds are really gonna be a key piece of evidence on all this. Can you walk us [[05:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=19324.22s)]

*  pilot air traffic control and potentially other aircraft? [[05:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=19336.38s)]
*  Well, absolutely. I mean, the regional jet pilots would be at that altitude, [[05:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=19341.100000000002s)]

*  as in night flying in general. You don't have the same, you know, clarity of [[05:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=19366.18s)]

*  that depth perception, you don't really have that. It's very flat. So with the [[05:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=19375.34s)]
*  closure rates and the similarity to the speeds, it would be hard to actually [[05:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=19381.5s)]
*  make out the regional jet, even though they did call it in sight. Now, you said [[05:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=19387.219999999998s)]

*  didn't see the collision at a minimum, these family members heard the [[05:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20477.48s)]
*  response. They likely could hear the sirens. We heard the CEO of American [[05:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20481.76s)]
*  Airlines saying he's sending support to them. What does that mean? Grief [[05:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20486.0s)]
*  counselors? What kind of help are they getting? [[05:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20489.199999999997s)]
*  It is that it is grief counseling. It is resources. It is knowing who to talk to, [[05:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20494.96s)]
*  where to talk to them and how to talk to them. Because this is a scenario that no [[05:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20499.12s)]
*  one would expect, especially considering that we haven't seen something like [[05:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20503.719999999998s)]
*  this in terms of a commercial collision and since 2009. And so I think that many [[05:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20508.199999999997s)]
*  people when they get on these planes that you know, you go through your safety [[05:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20514.12s)]
*  instructions and all the videos and things like that, expecting for things [[05:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20517.239999999998s)]
*  to go well. And so to your point to experience something like this in this [[05:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20520.28s)]
*  moment, certainly surreal. I have to tell you, I was on a plane from Atlanta to [[05:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20527.02s)]
*  this area earlier this morning, something else that was surreal on the [[05:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20532.42s)]
*  plane, watching so many people watch this news as it was unfolding these press [[05:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20536.059999999998s)]
*  conferences with this information as it was unfolding and many of them certainly [[05:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20540.219999999998s)]
*  concerned about what was happening and also looking for some reassurance about [[05:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20545.379999999997s)]
*  are they safe on the plane as well. The pilot, the crew members all reassured [[05:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20549.8s)]
*  our safety. I certainly think at a time like this, absolutely welcomed words. But [[05:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20556.420000000002s)]
*  back to that family, they are still trying to figure out exactly what to do [[05:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20564.760000000002s)]
*  next. In addition to American Airlines, Washington D. C. Is certainly supporting [[05:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20568.8s)]
*  these people as well. In fact, Mayor Muriel Bowser told our CBS News colleague [[05:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20573.36s)]
*  Nicole Scanga earlier today on 24 seven that they will do everything they can to [[05:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20578.260000000002s)]
*  wrap their arms around these families as well, because not only is Kansas [[05:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20582.660000000003s)]
*  hurting in this moment, but Washington D. C. As well as the nation. Skyler [[05:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20586.660000000003s)]
*  Henry, thank you so much for being there. President Donald Trump joined his vice [[05:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20590.9s)]
*  president and many others in a news conference from the White House [[05:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20595.620000000003s)]
*  briefing room earlier today after brief condolences to the families who have [[05:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20598.940000000002s)]
*  lost their loved ones. This is what the news conference turned into. Watch. [[05:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20602.920000000002s)]
*  We do not know what led to this crash, but we have some very strong opinions [[05:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20608.5s)]
*  and ideas, and I think we'll probably state those opinions now. My changed [[05:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20613.86s)]
*  the Obama standards from very mediocre at best to extraordinary. You remember [[05:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20618.9s)]
*  that only the highest aptitude have to be the highest intellect and [[05:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20624.86s)]
*  psychologically superior people were allowed to qualify for air traffic [[05:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20632.5s)]
*  controllers. That was not so prior to getting there. When I arrived in 2016, [[05:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20637.62s)]
*  I made that change very early on because I always felt this was a job that [[05:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20645.48s)]
*  and other jobs do. But this was a job that had to be superior intelligence. [[05:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20649.6s)]
*  All right, so let's continue the conversation with CBS News. Erin Navarro [[05:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20655.8s)]
*  live at the White House joining us now. Erin, we're glad you're with us. We [[05:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20658.719999999998s)]
*  know it's a very busy day where you are. Erin, the president wasted no time [[05:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20662.52s)]
*  tying this to the previous administration's policies. He punctuated his own [[05:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20666.22s)]
*  opposition to diversity, equity and inclusion policy positions. Do we know [[05:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20671.18s)]
*  for sure that if the error that led to this tragedy had any root in DEI [[05:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20676.9s)]
*  policies? [[05:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20682.14s)]
*  Reid, the short answer is no. And President Trump was asked how he came to [[05:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20685.34s)]
*  that conclusion later on in the press conference, and he said it's, quote, [[05:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20689.54s)]
*  common sense. What President Trump was referring to earlier in the conference [[05:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20692.8s)]
*  and a little bit in the answer you just played was the claim, and he mentioned [[05:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20697.96s)]
*  this in the memo he signed last week, that the FAA during the Biden [[05:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20702.84s)]
*  administration hired three individuals with, quote, serious infirmities that [[05:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20706.48s)]
*  could impact their job. They're at the press conference today. Trump talked a [[05:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20710.5s)]
*  lot about FAA and air traffic controllers being of the highest standard [[05:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20713.96s)]
*  and said he does not want the FAA to hire people with, quote, severe [[05:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20718.18s)]
*  intellectual and psychiatric disabilities. Again, we have no proof or [[05:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20721.2s)]
*  evidence that that had anything to do with the crash last night. We know that [[05:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20725.420000000002s)]
*  the Trump administration has been pushing their agencies to get rid of [[05:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20730.18s)]
*  anything regarding DEI policies. And while we're talking about Trump's [[05:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20734.22s)]
*  executive actions in relation to this, official with the Office of Personnel [[05:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20738.54s)]
*  Management confirmed to CBS News that air traffic controllers were exempt [[05:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20742.7s)]
*  when it comes to the hiring freeze that Trump issued last week, as well as this [[05:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20747.12s)]
*  deferred resignation, sometimes referred as a buyout that was issued by the [[05:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20751.18s)]
*  White House earlier this week. Air traffic controllers exempt from that as [[05:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20754.72s)]
*  they're considered those dealing with public safety. And Aaron, we also know [[05:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20759.04s)]
*  the president announced that he's going to immediately appoint an acting FAA [[05:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20763.28s)]
*  administrator. Do we know who that will be? [[05:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20766.68s)]
*  It'll be Christopher Rochelow, who was appointed deputy administrator for the [[05:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20770.44s)]
*  FAA about a week ago. He has lots of experience in the FAA, was a chief [[05:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20775.44s)]
*  safety officer, had also been a chief operating officer at the National [[05:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20781.08s)]
*  Business of Aviation Association. He had spent 10 years in the Air Force. Now, [[05:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20785.34s)]
*  the post was left vacant after Michael Whitaker resigned on Trump's [[05:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20790.74s)]
*  inauguration day. Whitaker had been confirmed without any objections in the [[05:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20794.86s)]
*  Senate about a year and a half ago. We know that Whitaker had been criticized [[05:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20800.100000000002s)]
*  by Elon Musk, who we know has the close ear of President Trump because [[05:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20804.34s)]
*  Whitaker proposed fines to Musk's SpaceX company. But Christopher Rochelow is now [[05:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20808.58s)]
*  the top head of the Federal Aviation Administration as they begin to work on [[05:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20814.100000000002s)]
*  what happened and investigate how this occurred. Well, and from his own words, [[05:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20819.940000000002s)]
*  the president painted quite a dark cloud about the previous administration [[05:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20823.9s)]
*  stacking of our nation's transportation system. But did he have anything to say [[05:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20827.36s)]
*  about whether Americans today who are about to get on a flight should feel [[05:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20831.780000000002s)]
*  confident to fly? [[05:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20835.52s)]
*  He said Americans right now should not be afraid to fly. I said he is not [[05:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20838.820000000003s)]
*  hesitant to fly and that it's been many years since something like this [[05:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20842.780000000002s)]
*  happened and they don't expect it to ever happen again. He, like Duffy said [[05:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20846.18s)]
*  earlier this morning, touted America's having the quote safest flying anywhere [[05:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20850.260000000002s)]
*  in the world. [[05:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20855.100000000002s)]
*  Erin Navarro, live from the White House, thank you so much for that [[05:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20856.420000000002s)]
*  conversation. Well, CBS News transportation teams really are helping [[05:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20858.9s)]
*  us to know a lot more about the two aircraft involved. So here you see on [[05:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20861.660000000003s)]
*  your screen what we're talking about at the time of the crash. The three [[05:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20865.9s)]
*  soldiers on board that Blackhawk helicopter flew in a standard military [[05:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20868.74s)]
*  training flight on the left, a standard PSA Airlines CRJ series jet holding 60 [[05:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20872.22s)]
*  passengers and four crew members. Newly appointed Department of Defense [[05:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20878.58s)]
*  Secretary Pete Hegseth talked more about that Blackhawk flight last night. [[05:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20882.640000000003s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[05:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20886.22s)]
*  Routine annual retraining of night flights on a standard corridor for a [[05:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20888.100000000002s)]
*  continuity of government mission. The military does dangerous things. It does [[05:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20894.46s)]
*  routine things on the regular basis. Tragically, last night a mistake was [[05:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20898.58s)]
*  made. I think the president is right. There was some sort of an elevation [[05:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20903.46s)]
*  issue that we have immediately begun investigating at the D. O. D. and Army [[05:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20908.42s)]
*  level. Army C. I. D. Is on the ground investigating top tier aviation assets [[05:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20912.34s)]
*  inside the D. O. D. Are investigating, sir, to get to the bottom of it so that [[05:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20918.2s)]
*  it does not happen again because it's absolutely unacceptable. So over the [[05:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20921.94s)]
*  next several hours, you could be hearing a lot more about the use of [[05:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20926.219999999998s)]
*  potential night vision goggles aboard that military helicopter. So let's [[05:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20928.78s)]
*  continue that conversation, bringing in CBS News Ellie Watson. So Ellie, you [[05:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20932.94s)]
*  have some information about these soldiers and the units they came from. [[05:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20936.98s)]
*  That's right. Read. We learned actually from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth [[05:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20943.94s)]
*  in that briefing at the White House that the three soldiers were a captain, [[05:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20947.26s)]
*  a staff sergeant and chief warrant officer. They were soldiers as a part [[05:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20951.579999999998s)]
*  of the 12th Aviation Battalion out in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, which is just [[05:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20956.94s)]
*  south of D. C. And they were flying a annual proficiency evaluation flight [[05:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20961.48s)]
*  when the tragic accident happened near Reagan Airport last night. We know from [[05:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20967.66s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, Secretary Hegseth said that they were a fairly experienced [[05:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20973.179999999997s)]
*  Black Hawk crew. We know the army is in the process of notifying family members, [[05:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20977.58s)]
*  and after that we may learn the identities of the three soldiers. Now [[05:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20983.620000000003s)]
*  we also have word that you've actually flown in a Black Hawk with the [[05:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20987.9s)]
*  Secretary of Defense. Take us inside that craft and the staffing of that [[05:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20991.780000000002s)]
*  craft. There were three, correct? [[05:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20995.420000000002s)]
*  There were three in this flight. Black Hawks are one of the modes of [[05:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=20999.54s)]
*  transportation for senior Defense Department officials like the Secretary [[05:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21003.82s)]
*  of Defense, but also senior army leaders, other senior Pentagon officials. [[05:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21008.5s)]
*  The most recent time I was in a Black Hawk was in December in Tokyo in Japan [[05:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21012.78s)]
*  when Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was visiting there. When I rode in the [[05:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21017.86s)]
*  Black Hawk, you put on big headphones to shield your ears from the noise, [[05:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21022.78s)]
*  and you get in, you sit down, there's a pilot, a co-pilot, and then two soldiers, [[05:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21029.54s)]
*  at least in my experience, looking out of each side of the helicopter. [[05:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21035.18s)]
*  And we know from Secretary Hegseth that the training exercise that this Black [[05:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21039.7s)]
*  Hawk was taking part in was a continuity of government mission. And what that [[05:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21044.18s)]
*  could mean is that these soldiers were training for an event if there were an [[05:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21049.06s)]
*  event that they needed to evacuate senior leaders like the Secretary of [[05:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21055.9s)]
*  Defense or other high up officials. They were training for an event like that [[05:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21059.7s)]
*  when this tragic accident took place last night. [[05:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21064.9s)]
*  What about the reported use of night vision goggles? Do you have any reporting [[05:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21068.86s)]
*  on that and how that could have affected their field of vision? [[05:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21072.9s)]
*  The Defense Secretary said that they had night vision goggles, but President [[05:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21078.46s)]
*  Trump in the briefing room was unclear on whether or not they were wearing them. [[05:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21082.86s)]
*  And if you have the night vision goggles on, you can see more clearly in your [[05:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21086.22s)]
*  range of vision, but may be obstructed from seeing peripherally. So that will be [[05:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21092.1s)]
*  part of the investigation when investigators get on the ground and start [[05:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21097.82s)]
*  looking at what led to this accident. We do know that Army CID is helping the [[05:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21102.42s)]
*  National Transportation Safety Board with this investigation, but the Army has [[05:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21108.98s)]
*  also sent investigators from the Army Combat Readiness Center to look into [[05:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21112.7s)]
*  what the Army part of this was. NTSB is leading the investigation, but the Army [[05:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21119.46s)]
*  will be in support. And Reid, I also want to note something because we've talked [[05:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21125.7s)]
*  all morning about how routine these helicopter flights are over the Potomac, [[05:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21131.06s)]
*  and that is true. But President Trump's pick to lead the Army, to be the Secretary [[05:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21135.86s)]
*  of the Army in his confirmation hearing, said that going forward, it may be worth [[05:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21142.06s)]
*  looking at whether or not these training flights should be so close to Reagan [[05:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21145.66s)]
*  National Airport. Yeah, I think there'll be a lot of drilling down on how to [[05:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21150.100000000002s)]
*  avoid this in the future on many levels. And let's talk a little bit about that, [[05:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21153.74s)]
*  because in his news conference, the president really seemed to indicate that [[05:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21157.86s)]
*  somehow, potentially DEI policy was to blame for this crash. He's already taking [[05:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21160.9s)]
*  some heat for that assertion, some saying it's too early to make that [[05:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21167.66s)]
*  assertion. But let's take it a step at a time. What is the chain of command in [[05:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21171.3s)]
*  this investigation that could find out if the president is actually talking [[05:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21175.34s)]
*  about something that's rooted in something concrete there? [[05:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21179.14s)]
*  The president's comments are way ahead of anything we've learned from [[05:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21184.54s)]
*  investigators. The investigation, as I said, will be led by the National [[05:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21188.18s)]
*  Transportation Safety Board with Army supporting. So the Army Criminal [[05:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21192.34s)]
*  Investigative Division, the Secretary of Defense Pete Hexeth said is [[05:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21197.7s)]
*  cooperating, is helping the NTSB. But we also have the Army Combat Readiness [[05:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21202.46s)]
*  Center sending investigators and subject matter experts who can examine and [[05:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21207.579999999998s)]
*  investigate and then tell the NTSB what led to the Army part of this and what [[05:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21213.06s)]
*  led to this training flight turning into such a terrible disaster. [[05:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21217.62s)]
*  Terrible disaster indeed. Ellie Watson, thank you so much reporting live from [[05:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21224.34s)]
*  the Pentagon for us. We appreciate it. Well, in addition to the fact that this [[05:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21227.98s)]
*  is a personal national tragedy, there is also a discussion happening after that [[05:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21232.219999999998s)]
*  news conference by the president, the vice president and Mr. Hexeth that is [[05:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21238.1s)]
*  taking a political tone much more on what they had to say, pointing some [[05:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21242.62s)]
*  potential fingers of blame and then also reaction from members of the prior [[05:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21247.579999999998s)]

*  The F. A. A. Which is overseen by Secretary Pete Buttigieg. A real [[05:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21532.02s)]
*  winner. That's guys a real winner. You know how badly everything's run since [[05:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21538.46s)]
*  he's run this Department of Transportation? He's a disaster. He was [[05:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21541.82s)]
*  a disaster as a mayor. He read his city into the ground and he's a disaster. Now [[05:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21547.22s)]
*  he's just got a good line of [[05:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21553.06s)]
*  the Department of Transportation. His government agency charged with [[05:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21554.22s)]
*  regulating civil aviation while he runs it 45,000 people and he's run it right [[05:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21560.98s)]
*  into the ground with his diversity. [[05:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21566.22s)]

*  his post. He writes despicable as families grieve Trump should be leading, [[05:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21574.940000000002s)]
*  not lying. He says we put safety first, drove down close calls, grew air [[05:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21579.98s)]
*  traffic control and had zero commercial airline crash fatalities out of millions [[05:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21583.88s)]

*  A. One of his first acts was to fire and suspend some of the key personnel who [[05:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21592.52s)]
*  helped keep our skies safe. Mr Buttigieg then saying time for the president to [[05:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21596.08s)]
*  show actual leadership and explain what he will do to prevent this from [[06:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21600.16s)]

*  tragedies have happened over the many, many decades of both Republicans and [[06:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21635.04s)]
*  Democrats at the helm of the great safety agencies that regulate the airways [[06:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21639.08s)]
*  in our country. So I just want to start there. It's strange to see the [[06:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21644.2s)]
*  political football, but I also want to make clear what the secretary is [[06:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21647.960000000003s)]
*  talking about are the actual data. So, for example, part of his comment was [[06:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21651.68s)]
*  about the air traffic controllers and the recruits that have happened. So the [[06:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21656.24s)]
*  during his leadership, we actually exceeded the number of recruitments for [[06:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21662.300000000003s)]
*  air traffic controllers last year for the very first time in decades. So [[06:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21667.72s)]
*  there's significant progress that has been made and then really big picture [[06:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21672.64s)]
*  here. Rather than get caught up in the culture wars that it's clear that this [[06:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21676.12s)]
*  president would like us to focus on what actually needs to happen fundamentally [[06:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21681.12s)]
*  is continued, sustained and in fact increased investment for the Federal [[06:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21685.48s)]
*  Aviation Administration. Consider the fact that the operations for the air [[06:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21689.56s)]
*  traffic organization caps out at about $10 billion and just millions of that [[06:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21694.28s)]
*  amount is dedicated towards air traffic control operations. And so to be really, [[06:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21699.48s)]
*  really clear, part of what needs to happen is a lot of investment into [[06:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21705.28s)]
*  upgrading air traffic control towers into upgrading technology and tools that [[06:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21708.76s)]
*  are used to keep passengers safe and certainly not this political back and [[06:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21712.719999999998s)]
*  forth. You've got a president of the United States, though, who's targeting [[06:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21716.36s)]
*  Mr Buddha Judge, implying that he hired unqualified individuals with. And these [[06:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21719.42s)]
*  are the presidents were disabilities and psychological issues. The president [[06:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21723.96s)]
*  said it. So we have to ask it where they're hiring policies that put people [[06:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21728.2s)]
*  like this in place who have, as the president said, psychological issues. [[06:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21731.36s)]
*  Absolutely a fair question. And to be really clear under the previous [[06:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21735.52s)]
*  administration, there were very inclusive hiring practices that are [[06:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21739.32s)]
*  designed, if you think about it, to ensure that the agencies that protect [[06:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21743.28s)]
*  Americans are educated by the lived experiences of those Americans that it [[06:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21746.64s)]
*  is designed to serve in no way, shape or form. Would there have been anyone [[06:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21751.8s)]
*  in an air traffic control tower who have severe mental disabilities or [[06:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21756.32s)]
*  would be unable to carry out the responsibilities of that job? It's [[06:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21760.44s)]
*  again a deflection, a distraction from the fact that a very terrible thing [[06:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21763.92s)]
*  happened today, and it was under the watch of this president. You say severe [[06:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21768.719999999998s)]
*  mental disabilities. Are you personally aware of any hiring of anybody who was [[06:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21772.739999999998s)]
*  flagged as having any mental disabilities? I am not. So the president [[06:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21776.32s)]
*  also says that people of merit should feel these government jobs. What do we [[06:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21780.8s)]
*  know about the people who were hired? And we really need to be clear that we [[06:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21784.6s)]
*  do not know if there was any connection between D. I. Or any other policies [[06:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21788.8s)]
*  that the president of the United States has said it is early in the [[06:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21793.92s)]
*  investigation. But the president did have to say a lot about those D. I. [[06:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21796.6s)]
*  Hires. You mentioned an inclusive hiring policies. Do you feel that there [[06:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21800.399999999998s)]
*  were anybody who were hired because of D. I. Policy rather than merit? [[06:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21805.16s)]
*  What I can tell you is I have spent my own fair share of time in air traffic [[06:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21810.96s)]
*  control towers all across this country. And what I can tell you about the [[06:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21814.88s)]
*  people that I've encountered is that they went through extensive training. [[06:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21818.48s)]
*  They're extraordinarily committed to the jobs, and they take the safety of [[06:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21821.92s)]
*  the flying public extraordinarily seriously. There's no question in my [[06:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21825.76s)]
*  mind that the people that are operating our air traffic control towers right [[06:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21830.0s)]
*  now have the best interest and are incredibly talented and skilled at [[06:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21833.079999999998s)]
*  their jobs. We appreciate the conversation. We know some of the [[06:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21837.239999999998s)]
*  questions were tough, but they have to be asked. The president of the United [[06:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21840.56s)]
*  States raises them and we have to follow up and ask. So thank you so much [[06:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21843.600000000002s)]
*  for taking those questions. Well, the fallout from the American Airlines [[06:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21846.88s)]
*  plane crash looming large over Washington, where Senate confirmation [[06:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21850.56s)]
*  hearings are being held at this very moment for key trump appointees. [[06:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21854.16s)]
*  Senator Mark Warner talked about the tragedy at the start of the [[06:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21858.24s)]
*  confirmation hearings for Tulsi Gabbard. Listen, it's a horrible tragedy. The [[06:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21861.84s)]
*  victims families are still being notified. For those of us who live in [[06:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21867.36s)]
*  this region, you know, it's [[06:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21873.32s)]
*  always kind of complicated. We've got Virginia, D. C. Maryland and a host of [[06:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21877.16s)]
*  local jurisdictions. But last night when this tragedy took place and I happen [[06:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21883.0s)]
*  to be driving by national on the way home and saw all the first responders [[06:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21886.48s)]
*  rushing to the scene, [[06:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21891.559999999998s)]
*  people came from as far away as Baltimore, Fairfax County. We had [[06:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21893.8s)]
*  duty and federal officials there. And these first responders is always ran [[06:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21899.1s)]
*  towards the tragedy. Um, there'll be a time to figure out how what happened and [[06:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21904.64s)]
*  how we rectify it. But today our thoughts and prayers ought to be with [[06:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21910.52s)]
*  the families and again thanking our first responders. Let's go live to CBS [[06:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21914.16s)]
*  News congressional reporter Tori and small. You are there in our nation's [[06:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21919.28s)]
*  capital. Just a stone's throw away from where this is all playing out. Let's [[06:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21922.42s)]
*  first of all focus on the path to confirmation for some of the most key [[06:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21926.14s)]
*  and controversial trump nominees. What have you been hearing from lawmakers? [[06:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21929.78s)]
*  Yeah, read. I'm keeping my head on the soul because there are three ongoing [[06:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21936.62s)]
*  confirmation hearings happening at the same time. That's for Robert F. Kennedy [[06:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21940.14s)]
*  Jr. Trump's picked had the Department of Health and Human Services. Then [[06:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21943.94s)]
*  there's Tosi Gabbert, Trump's pick for D. N. I. Director and then cash, but tell [[06:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21949.02s)]
*  who has been arguably under the greatest amount of scrutiny from Democrats on [[06:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21955.98s)]
*  his respective panel as he's been tapped to lead the FBI. Patel is an [[06:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21961.78s)]
*  individual who is known as a staunch trump loyalists, which gave pause to [[06:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21967.62s)]
*  quite a few Democrats on this panel. I talked to Senator Richard Blumenthal [[06:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21973.06s)]
*  ahead of this hearing, and he said, even though there appears to be a pathway [[06:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21977.5s)]
*  to confirmation for not just, uh, Patel, but also Pam Bondi, who's been tapped [[06:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21983.1s)]
*  to be the next A. G. He thinks that it's the job of Democrats to illustrate [[06:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21990.02s)]
*  just why this is concerning. Take a listen to what he told me. [[06:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=21994.82s)]
*  Bondi Patel appears to have the pathway to the confirmation. If that [[06:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22001.5s)]
*  happens, what concerns do you have about the makeup of these institutions? [[06:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22007.06s)]
*  We're at a break the glass moment for our democracy. J. D. Vance has said [[06:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22012.96s)]
*  that maybe the president needn't follow the courts in their orders because [[06:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22017.9s)]
*  they have no armies or police force. I'm going to be looking to Pam Bondi to [[06:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22023.920000000002s)]
*  be saying no to the president United States if he gives her any illegal or [[06:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22028.94s)]
*  moral order. And I'm going to be looking to my Republican colleagues to join me [[06:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22033.34s)]
*  in insisting that she do the right thing. I think we're only at the beginning [[06:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22038.579999999998s)]
*  of this potential range terror for our democracy because a Department of [[06:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22045.059999999998s)]
*  Justice that's let loose without respect for the law will do lasting damage [[06:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22052.059999999998s)]
*  to our democracy. [[06:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22058.38s)]
*  Mhm. [[06:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22059.86s)]
*  There were quite a few striking moments during that confirmation hearing [[06:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22062.760000000002s)]
*  Blumenthal actually read back Patel's previous comments asking if he still [[06:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22066.940000000002s)]
*  stood by them. Many of those comments, not just Blumenthal, but many [[06:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22072.86s)]
*  Democrats on that panel believe we're disqualifying of Patel because in their [[06:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22076.74s)]
*  words they were anti law enforcement and conspiratorial. Well, we know that [[06:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22082.32s)]
*  Kash Patel has faced a lot of criticism for the comments that he's made about [[06:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22087.42s)]
*  the agency that Trump has tapped him to lead and that he that really led to a [[06:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22091.14s)]
*  pretty heated exchange today. [[06:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22096.059999999998s)]
*  Yeah, read Senator Clobuchar, Amy Clobuchar of Minnesota had a very [[06:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22101.26s)]
*  heated back and forth between them. And in fact, it went over her time. It [[06:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22107.12s)]
*  caused quite a few Republican members of the panel to argue with the chairman [[06:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22111.539999999997s)]
*  to rein her in because they felt it was out of line. But similar to [[06:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22116.58s)]
*  Blumenthal, she wanted to read back what he said previously and get him to stand [[06:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22121.22s)]
*  on those words today. Take a listen to that exchange. [[06:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22126.420000000002s)]
*  Do we have that sound? [[06:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22133.120000000003s)]
*  Did you say that the FBI headquarters should be shut down and reopen as a [[06:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22136.420000000002s)]
*  museum of the deep state? Mr Chairman, are we allowed to go an extra time? [[06:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22141.38s)]
*  Let's see. You got you get a second round before I call on Senator Lee. [[06:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22145.7s)]
*  Could he just answer the question if he said that the FBI headquarters where [[06:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22150.98s)]
*  they investigate cyber crime and terrorism, Mr. Chair, shut down and open [[06:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22155.420000000002s)]
*  as a deep state, Mr. Chair, museum. Did he say that the headquarters should be [[06:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22159.38s)]
*  shut down? Mr. Chair, I deserve an answer to that question. He is asking to be [[06:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22163.86s)]
*  head of the FBI and he said that their headquarters should be shut down. Mr. [[06:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22168.24s)]
*  Chair, Parliamentary Inquiry. You got anything you want to say, Mr Patel, [[06:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22172.38s)]
*  before I go on to Senator Lee? Simply this. If the best attacks on me are [[06:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22176.4s)]
*  gonna be false accusations and grotesque mischaracterizations, the only thing [[06:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22181.02s)]
*  this body is doing is defeating the credibility of the men and women at the [[06:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22184.56s)]

*  I was on the ground in service of this nation and any accusations leveled [[06:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22193.86s)]

*  are grotesquely unfair. And I will have you reminded that I have been endorsed [[06:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22202.460000000003s)]
*  by over 300,000 law enforcement officers to become the next director of the FBI. [[06:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22207.3s)]
*  Let's ask them. [[06:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22212.82s)]
*  Hmm. Read what I found instructive about this exchange is in my conversation [[06:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22215.420000000002s)]
*  with Blumenthal, he said that the goal for Democrats with this confirmation [[06:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22220.780000000002s)]
*  hearing, knowing that there is a pathway to confirmation is to introduce the [[06:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22224.86s)]
*  American people. So utilizing the public nature of this hearing to paint a [[06:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22229.22s)]
*  picture of who Patel is. These allegations about what he said before [[06:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22233.7s)]
*  his previous words or comments on these institutions come just come before just [[06:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22240.02s)]
*  days ago when a whistleblower alleged that he put almost compromised a [[06:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22248.100000000002s)]
*  hostage situation in Yemen where there were Americans looking to be secured by [[06:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22253.58s)]
*  the U. S. He had prematurely made comments to the Wall Street Journal on [[06:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22260.5s)]
*  that release. So this is building. They're looking to build this case [[06:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22267.06s)]
*  against Patel, knowing that it might not sway the Republican colleagues, but at [[06:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22271.420000000002s)]
*  least to paint this picture of who the incoming administration might be in and [[06:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22275.9s)]
*  what that could mean for the future of these institutions. Read and just to [[06:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22281.22s)]
*  button this up. Speaking to timeline, what are you hearing for the [[06:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22284.98s)]
*  confirmation hearings and votes for R. F. K. For Tulsi Gabbard and for Mr Patel? [[06:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22287.78s)]
*  Do you have a sense of the timeline and how this will play out this week or [[06:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22293.22s)]
*  maybe into next week? [[06:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22296.02s)]
*  Yeah, their hearings will wrap up today. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Met before the [[06:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22299.02s)]
*  House or sorry, the Senate Health Committee that's health, education, labor [[06:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22305.100000000002s)]
*  and pensions. That was his second hearing yesterday. He met with Senate [[06:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22311.34s)]
*  Finance, who would ultimately be tasked with voting him out of committee to the [[06:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22314.5s)]
*  floor. So far, it appears that he has the numbers among Republicans to make it to [[06:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22318.5s)]
*  the floor at some point. Same with Tulsi Gabbard. The question is, how long would [[06:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22323.100000000002s)]
*  it take for them to actually reach a final confirmation vote? Democrats can [[06:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22327.18s)]
*  invoke their right to filibuster this to enforce a debate on this, but that will [[06:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22332.9s)]
*  prolong the inevitable. If at least three Republicans, if only three [[06:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22337.9s)]
*  Republicans, I should say, defect. The numbers are still there. Senate former [[06:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22343.74s)]
*  senator and now vice president, now the president of the Senate, J. D. Vance [[06:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22348.38s)]
*  could come in and test that tie breaking vote for all three of these these [[06:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22352.86s)]
*  candidates. Torian Small watching the path to confirmation. Thank you so much. [[06:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22357.260000000002s)]

*  president of the United States briefly expressing condolences to the victims, [[06:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22699.04s)]

*  prior administration and the policies and the staffing of the prior [[06:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22709.8s)]

*  I think it's a bit early to be making any determinations in this particular [[06:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22718.24s)]

*  can't really begin to talk about what happened until we've completed the [[06:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22734.16s)]
*  investigation. I think perhaps the president and some of his [[06:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22740.36s)]
*  administration are getting a little ahead of where we are. NTSB will do a [[06:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22744.52s)]
*  very thorough and a political evaluation of the system. And our our role is not [[06:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22750.04s)]
*  to place blame, but to figure out what happened, why it happened and how it can [[06:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22757.0s)]
*  be prevented. And then there are various parties to the investigation, which in [[06:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22761.8s)]
*  this case will include the FAA, Department of the Army, possibly the [[06:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22766.2s)]
*  Department of Defense, the aircraft manufacturers. And so everybody will [[06:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22770.84s)]
*  play a role. NTSB will lead the investigation and we'll be looking very [[06:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22777.879999999997s)]
*  carefully at the personnel, what they did, how they performed. And then we'll [[06:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22781.96s)]
*  come to an unbiased determination of, you know, what if anything, what [[06:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22787.12s)]
*  mistakes were made and then what we can do to correct them in the future. [[06:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22793.039999999997s)]

*  a chance to go through it and make sure everything is accounted for and they're [[06:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22852.48s)]
*  able to determine exactly how the aircraft impacted. One thing that is of [[06:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22857.36s)]

*  don't know what kind of recording devices the Black Hawk had on it, but [[06:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=22883.08s)]

*  to go and somebody else might not be able to step back on the ice for a [[06:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23260.96s)]

*  make sure our ice is occupied and is at capacity. But I have to tell you that [[06:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23278.6s)]
*  this ice being empty and this arena having gone silent, it makes me feel good. [[06:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23283.6s)]

*  to see the facility empty. It's almost eerie, but I think it's fitting and I [[06:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23294.239999999998s)]
*  think it's respectful. [[06:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23303.239999999998s)]
*  I skated and trained at the old facility, not here. It was very different than this. [[06:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23306.239999999998s)]
*  But it's, so I didn't come back and skate here, but coming back and training [[06:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23317.239999999998s)]
*  here, but I said the same thing as Doug just said when I walked in and it was kind [[06:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23324.239999999998s)]
*  of like, just we went upstairs and it was silent. It was eerie. It just is a [[06:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23329.239999999998s)]
*  little strange to be in and in this ice rink, other ice rinks, there's not [[06:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23334.239999999998s)]
*  figure skating all day and here there's figure skating and it's, there's always [[06:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23339.239999999998s)]
*  music and we perform to music. It's emotional and sometimes that may make it [[06:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23344.239999999998s)]
*  harder for some because you hear the music and you start emoting and it can [[06:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23349.88s)]
*  just pull out all these feelings and so it could be challenging to get back out [[06:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23353.88s)]
*  there. That's okay. Just a little at a time and just do what we can and be there. [[06:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23358.88s)]
*  As I say, we just have to be there for one another, but I think to be here, I [[06:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23366.88s)]
*  don't come here that often and I just didn't know what else to do. So I just [[06:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23371.88s)]
*  thought I needed to be with some friends. Paul and I have been through a lot [[06:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23377.52s)]

*  and stand in need of comfort looks like from an Olympic skater, Nancy Kerrigan. [[06:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23423.16s)]
*  And you know, you see that empty ice sheet behind her and you are mindful, as [[06:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23428.16s)]
*  am I, having covered several Olympics, you are mindful of the many hours that [[06:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23432.8s)]

*  right now go to CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd. Sam, [[06:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23451.8s)]
*  that just gives you such pause. But also when we think of the victims' families, [[06:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23455.8s)]
*  we think of the victims as the people who have been hurt, but also the victims [[06:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23460.44s)]
*  who have been hurt. So I'm wondering if you can tell us a little bit about how [[06:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23465.44s)]
*  the victims do need answers as part of their healing journey. Talk to us about [[06:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23470.44s)]
*  how critical the information on those boxes will be that have now been [[06:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23475.44s)]
*  recovered. Well, the investigation is being led by an entity named the NTSB. [[06:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23479.44s)]
*  The NTSB will be the lead agency investigating what occurred in very close [[06:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23484.44s)]
*  time, but there are two black boxes. One that's in the cockpit and that really [[06:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23490.079999999998s)]
*  monitors communications in the cockpit and with air traffic control. And then [[06:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23495.079999999998s)]
*  another second black box that tracks things like altitude and airspeed and how [[06:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23500.079999999998s)]
*  the systems on the aircraft are performing. Both of those black boxes are [[06:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23505.079999999998s)]
*  going to be incredibly important to the investigation to try to ascertain if [[06:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23509.079999999998s)]
*  there was any miscommunication between the commercial airliner and, for example, [[06:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23514.079999999998s)]
*  air traffic control or if a system malfunctioned. The second piece of this [[06:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23519.72s)]
*  investigation that's going to be really critical is what occurred with that [[06:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23524.72s)]
*  helicopter. And the Department of Defense and the Department of the Army are [[06:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23527.72s)]
*  going to have to brief publicly as to what systems or boxes were on the [[06:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23531.72s)]
*  helicopter to try to understand what its flight pattern was like. [[06:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23536.72s)]

*  The first commercial airline disaster in the US in 16 years. [[06:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23783.66s)]
*  Search and recovery efforts are underway in Washington after that deadly crash between [[06:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23788.42s)]
*  a military aircraft and a regional American Airlines plane last night. [[06:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23792.42s)]
*  While emergency crews are searching the Potomac River to find the crash victims, we are going [[06:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23797.02s)]
*  to show you video now, courtesy of Earth Cam that shows the moment of the collision. [[06:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23801.260000000002s)]
*  The jet was on course approaching Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Virginia coming [[06:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23806.260000000002s)]
*  from Wichita, Kansas. [[06:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23811.28s)]
*  60 passengers were believed to be on board the American Airlines flight along with four [[06:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23813.100000000002s)]
*  crew members. [[06:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23817.18s)]
*  Three soldiers are said to have been on board the military helicopter. [[06:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23818.66s)]
*  People say roughly 30 bodies have been recovered so far, including all three soldiers. [[06:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23822.78s)]

*  The president spoke to the tragedy earlier today. [[06:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23838.14s)]
*  The work is now shifted to a recovery mission. [[06:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23841.559999999998s)]
*  Sadly, there are no survivors. [[06:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23846.5s)]
*  This was a dark and excruciating night in our nation's capital and in our nation's [[06:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23850.34s)]
*  history and a tragedy of terrible proportions. [[06:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23855.1s)]
*  As one nation, we grieve for every precious soul that has been taken from us so suddenly. [[06:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23859.9s)]
*  And we are a country of really we are in mourning. [[06:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23867.62s)]
*  Skyler Henry is at Reagan National Airport, which reopened just a few hours ago. [[06:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23872.54s)]
*  Skyler, where do things stand in the investigation? [[06:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23876.420000000002s)]
*  Right, Lindsay. [[06:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23880.34s)]
*  Well, the NTSB is leading this investigation. [[06:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23881.34s)]
*  We actually anticipate hearing from them during a press conference later on in this hour. [[06:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23885.86s)]
*  We heard from officials earlier today who have described what it has been like in this [[06:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23890.78s)]
*  recovery mission and their efforts as they have worked through the night, hours trying [[06:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23895.26s)]
*  to get through the records to see if there were at the time any survivors. [[06:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23900.14s)]
*  Now, as you heard from President Trump in the briefing room there, this is now a recovery [[06:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23904.5s)]
*  mission. [[06:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23909.7s)]
*  They say that because of what the conditions were at that time and where they stand today, [[06:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23910.7s)]
*  it is certainly very difficult for anyone to survive. [[06:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23915.22s)]
*  We know that people or we know that crews say that they have recovered at least 30 bodies. [[06:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23918.7s)]
*  D.C.'s Mayor Miro Bowser told our Nicole Skanga earlier today on CBS News 24 seven [[06:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23925.3s)]
*  that they will continue to work until all of those bodies are recovered. [[06:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23932.18s)]
*  They also talked about what it's been like trying to console the families here who were [[06:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23936.18s)]
*  waiting. [[06:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23940.3s)]
*  Remember, this flight was minutes away from landing here at Reagan National Airport, and [[06:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23941.3s)]
*  so there are countless family members here that were supposed to be picking up their [[06:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23945.699999999997s)]
*  loved ones and take them back to their respective homes and locations. [[06:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23949.82s)]
*  And so now this is not only a recovery effort but also one where this community and this [[06:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23952.899999999998s)]
*  area is trying to wrap their arms around all of these families that are looking for answers, [[06:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23958.62s)]
*  trying to figure out where to go, what to do, how to get any sort of support, because [[06:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23964.739999999998s)]
*  this is something that obviously was not expected, but also they don't know what to do next. [[06:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23969.1s)]
*  Obviously these bodies are being recovered, but we're also still looking for answers as [[06:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23975.46s)]
*  to how something like this has happened. [[06:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23979.78s)]
*  We know that this is what officials have referred to as a congested airspace in that there is [[06:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23982.0s)]
*  commercial aircraft that come to this location, military aircraft that come to this location, [[06:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23986.92s)]
*  but there are also several operations, training missions that happen throughout the day and [[06:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23992.34s)]
*  throughout, it was relatively normal having lived here in Washington, D.C. [[06:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=23997.1s)]
*  And so to see something like this happen, to know the work that air traffic control [[06:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24001.42s)]
*  has to do in order to make sure that this place runs smoothly, there are certainly a [[06:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24005.34s)]
*  lot of questions that members of the Trump administration, that includes Defense Secretary [[06:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24009.66s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, as well as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and others, say that they want [[06:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24013.42s)]
*  to get to the bottom. [[06:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24017.46s)]
*  What do we know about the victims? [[06:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24018.46s)]
*  Well, we're learning a little bit more. [[06:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24023.26s)]
*  We know that there were several high-profile figure skaters that were on board, both U.S. [[06:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24025.62s)]
*  nationals as well as Russian nationals. [[06:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24032.019999999997s)]
*  In fact, President Trump spoke about that during that briefing earlier today. [[06:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24033.82s)]
*  He also said that several other international flyers were on board that regional jet as [[06:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24037.78s)]
*  well. [[06:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24043.94s)]
*  He was yet to release or announce where and what those countries may be. [[06:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24044.94s)]
*  We are also hearing from several other civic groups. [[06:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24050.620000000003s)]
*  We've heard from union members who say that some of their members were on board this flight [[06:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24053.620000000003s)]
*  as well. [[06:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24058.34s)]
*  Yet to release any official names at this point. [[06:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24059.620000000003s)]
*  But in the hours following this incident, we know that this is something that is impacting [[06:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24063.86s)]
*  not only those in Kansas, but people here in the Washington, D.C. area and obviously [[06:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24067.940000000002s)]
*  an international perspective as well. [[06:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24072.98s)]
*  Skyler, we did hear from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in a video message posted to [[06:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24074.9s)]
*  social media earlier today. [[06:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24079.54s)]
*  Let's listen to that. [[06:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24080.98s)]
*  It was a fairly experienced crew and it was doing a required annual night evaluation. [[06:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24081.98s)]
*  They did have night vision goggles. [[06:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24091.38s)]
*  The 12th Aviation Battalion, as of now, has granted a 48-hour operational pause on contingency [[06:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24095.74s)]
*  missions as what happened is reviewed. [[06:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24101.82s)]
*  Now, he was also with the president this afternoon calling this unacceptable, saying that they [[06:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24104.940000000002s)]
*  will get to the bottom of it. [[06:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24109.38s)]
*  And he echoed the president's comments, which we will get into a bit more with Nancy Cortez, [[06:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24110.9s)]
*  that DEI, diversity, equity, inclusion, has no place in government, said all employees [[06:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24115.3s)]
*  must be colorblind and merit-based, naming air traffic controllers specifically. [[06:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24120.100000000002s)]
*  There's no evidence at this time suggesting the DEI initiatives played a role, but what [[06:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24124.18s)]
*  else did Secretary Hegseth say? [[06:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24127.82s)]
*  Well he emphasized, again, that the service members who were on board that Black Hawk [[06:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24133.940000000002s)]
*  were experienced. [[06:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24138.82s)]
*  This, although it was a training exercise, did not and should not indicate the fact that [[06:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24139.82s)]
*  they were inexperienced fliers at all. [[06:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24145.14s)]
*  In fact, that this was a practice routine mission to nearby Fort Belvoir in Virginia. [[06:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24147.54s)]
*  And this was something that, you know, they do on an annual basis. [[06:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24154.34s)]
*  And though that they were flying at nighttime, they had their nighttime goggles as well, [[06:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24157.62s)]
*  but also said that these were experienced military service members. [[06:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24163.14s)]
*  And so he also wanted to stress that point. [[06:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24167.780000000002s)]
*  But again, the big question is what happened with that communication? [[06:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24170.420000000002s)]
*  Where did it fall off between air traffic control and the Black Hawk? [[06:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24174.940000000002s)]
*  Many are still trying to figure out exactly what might have happened, because remember, [[06:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24179.02s)]
*  as I pointed out, that regional jet was just moments away from landing here at Reagan. [[06:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24182.460000000003s)]
*  And so many questions are out there as to whether there was any sort of mistakes that [[06:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24187.22s)]
*  were made by the service members on board of that Black Hawk, or if there was something [[06:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24191.820000000003s)]
*  that could be done to improve the line of communication between air traffic control [[06:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24195.82s)]
*  and those who are on board both aircraft. [[06:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24200.18s)]
*  Skyler Henry, thank you. [[06:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24202.62s)]
*  Let's bring in Captain Mike Cofield for more on this. [[06:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24204.82s)]
*  He is a principal for Coast to Coast Strategies and a retired veteran of the airline industry [[06:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24207.38s)]
*  with more than 30 years of commercial experience. [[06:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24211.94s)]
*  Captain, thank you for being with us on such a somber day for our country. [[06:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24214.579999999998s)]
*  What is your initial reaction and early assessment based on what we know? [[06:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24218.34s)]
*  Well, first of all, thoughts and prayers go out to those families. [[06:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24223.7s)]
*  I spent 31 years with United, flying over 22,000 hours. [[06:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24227.46s)]
*  One thing that I thought of initially as I looked at my wife and my kids and my grandkids [[06:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24233.22s)]
*  today was that it was really important when I said hello, when I said goodbye. [[06:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24238.62s)]
*  Those crews, every day when they go to work and when they come home, their families are [[06:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24245.02s)]
*  impacted dramatically. [[06:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24250.96s)]
*  And it came back home to us and especially as we run our current airline KM cargo. [[06:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24252.359999999997s)]
*  The helicopter was where it was supposed to be in terms of the route. [[06:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24264.48s)]
*  I think there is some conversation relative to the fact that there were aircraft lining [[06:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24269.039999999997s)]
*  up to land to the north and as they do, unruly one zero, some of the regional jets have an [[06:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24275.12s)]
*  opportunity given to them as long as traffic available to do a half circle route into runway [[06:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24283.44s)]
*  three three. [[06:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24290.12s)]
*  It's done with smaller aircraft, our regional jets. [[06:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24291.12s)]
*  And I don't believe that the helicopter or the airliner saw either each other at all. [[06:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24294.52s)]
*  And you just mentioned to what the president has spoken of, I think they're going to go back and [[06:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24304.32s)]
*  look at ATC training when those red lights are on. [[06:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24309.879999999997s)]
*  That's actually an alert that the controller is seeing on his screen. [[06:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24313.6s)]
*  But he's also looking out the window of the cab of the tower. [[06:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24317.48s)]
*  Now, I think they used to be you would go to Oklahoma City, the training center, and you'd [[06:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24322.28s)]
*  spend four months, five months in training in Oklahoma City. [[06:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24328.12s)]
*  And then you would go to a facility like, to give an example, maybe Leesburg or a smaller [[06:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24332.079999999998s)]
*  Knoxville, Tennessee, you go to a smaller airport and then get trained to be qualified at a larger [[06:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24339.44s)]
*  facility. That's not what's been occurred over the last few years. [[06:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24346.079999999998s)]
*  What's happened is they've shortened the time in Oklahoma City and they've actually demanded or made [[06:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24350.16s)]
*  training available at the local facility where a senior ATC person would then do training on the job, [[06:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24356.64s)]
*  so to speak. I've always thought that, especially over the last 10 years or so, that that's really not a [[06:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24364.239999999998s)]
*  very good plan, that they ought to go back to the original plan. [[06:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24369.92s)]
*  Captain, it's been six years since the last sort of collision like this happened. [[06:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24373.2s)]
*  How rare is something like this? [[06:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24377.28s)]
*  Well, in the United States, it's almost, it almost never happens. [[06:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24380.16s)]
*  If you think about 31 years, there's only a handful of opportunities, [[06:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24384.480000000003s)]
*  times it's something like this happened. Now, overseas, you had the Korean incident just [[06:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24390.72s)]
*  eight weeks ago, but domestic travel in the United States is incredibly safe. [[06:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24396.24s)]
*  Professional aviators, professional maintenance, no shortcuts, safety's first, [[06:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24401.600000000002s)]
*  and no questions to the captain if it's not safe. So I think those are things that are [[06:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24409.2s)]
*  true. I just don't think that, and one of the things I'm going to communicate back to the NTSB, [[06:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24413.92s)]
*  and especially to Senator Jerry Moran, and an aside to that is that he is the new chairman of [[06:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24421.28s)]
*  the Commerce Aviation Subcommittee, and he is from Kansas. And he's also the most knowledgeable [[06:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24427.28s)]
*  aviation expert in the United States Congress. I mean, he's, and he's got a heart that's unbelievable. [[06:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24434.16s)]
*  So that's good news. And the history of Kansas relative aviation, my dad, B-29 was made in Kansas. [[06:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24439.68s)]
*  Aviation is ingrained in that region. So I think there are some good things that are going to come [[06:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24450.08s)]
*  out of this. We hope that the president chooses and encourages the chair of the board of the NTSB [[06:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24456.88s)]
*  to handle this in the GO team. I don't know what they've decided yet this morning, this afternoon, [[06:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24464.24s)]
*  but it's my hope that the chairman takes over this since DCA is owned by the federal government, [[06:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24469.28s)]
*  and Congress is responsible. All right. Well, Captain Mike Covell, we have to leave it there [[06:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24475.36s)]
*  today, but hopefully we can have you back on to discuss this tragedy. Thank you for your time, [[06:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24478.96s)]
*  sir. Sure. Thank you so much. A short time ago, President Trump spoke about the crash and his [[06:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24482.8s)]
*  first appearance in the White House briefing room since being sworn in for a second term. [[06:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24488.32s)]
*  Without evidence, he shifted blame to his two Democratic predecessors, as well as diversity, [[06:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24492.399999999998s)]
*  equity and inclusion initiatives. We must have only the highest standards for those who work in [[06:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24496.96s)]
*  our aviation system. I changed the Obama standards from very mediocre at best to extraordinary. [[06:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24501.6s)]
*  And then when I left office and Biden took over, he changed them back to lower than ever before. [[06:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24509.28s)]
*  For more, let's bring in CBS News. Chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes. [[06:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24518.64s)]
*  Nancy, the president slammed the Obama and Biden administrations. He seemed to insinuate they loosened [[06:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24521.92s)]
*  standards for air traffic controllers and FAA employees in the name of DEI. He also slammed [[06:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24526.64s)]
*  former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. What did he say? And is there currently any evidence [[06:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24533.12s)]
*  to support that standards have gone down and may have contributed to this? There isn't any [[06:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24538.0s)]
*  indication, Lindsay, that the standards have changed markedly. In fact, sources have told [[06:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24543.76s)]
*  me that the standards for air traffic controllers have always been quite high and that they need to [[06:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24549.52s)]
*  go through rigorous mental and physical testing to get the job in the first place. [[06:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24554.4s)]
*  And so we're still looking into what the president might have been referring to when he [[06:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24562.08s)]
*  talked about those changes in standards. But more broadly, what I think stood out to a lot of [[06:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24566.4s)]
*  reporters in the room was that on one hand the president was saying that he still doesn't know [[06:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24572.32s)]
*  what led to this particular crash, and then at the same time saying that DEI was somehow to blame. [[06:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24576.800000000003s)]
*  What we know so far, and I know you've been discussing it on the show, is that according to [[06:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24584.32s)]
*  the military the Black Hawk pilots were actually quite experienced. And American Airlines says that [[06:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24589.04s)]
*  the pilots involved in the crash were experienced as well. One had six years with the airline, [[06:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24596.24s)]
*  the other had nearly two years with the airline. We don't know much about the air traffic [[06:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24602.72s)]
*  controllers involved, but I can tell you that because Reagan National has such a complicated [[06:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24607.28s)]
*  approach, as we've been discussing over the past 12 hours or so, the air traffic controllers who [[06:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24614.160000000003s)]
*  are chosen for Reagan National tend to be quite experienced as well. So it's unclear at this point [[06:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24621.600000000002s)]
*  where the president is getting the information that he is using to describe this as somehow a [[06:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24630.24s)]
*  failure related to DEI. We pressed him repeatedly about that today, but he said that the reason he [[06:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24637.04s)]
*  knows it is because he's a smart person and not because of any particular information that he was [[06:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24644.0s)]
*  willing to share. Right, saying he has common sense. Nancy, Sean Duffy is in his second day [[06:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24648.4s)]
*  as transportation secretary. He reiterated this shouldn't have happened. He also doubled down on [[06:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24652.8s)]
*  the president's comments that we can only have the best and brightest. The president also named a new [[06:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24657.52s)]
*  acting administrator of the FAA. What will both of their roles be in this? Well, they're going to [[06:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24661.76s)]
*  have to grapple with some very difficult decisions in the near term. This will obviously [[06:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24667.84s)]
*  reignite questions, Lindsay, about congestion at Reagan National Airport. It's so uniquely situated, [[06:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24673.68s)]
*  so close to downtown D.C., so close to multiple military bases where helicopters take off and land. [[06:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24681.84s)]
*  And through the years, there has always been a major fight on Capitol Hill [[06:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24691.36s)]
*  between members of Congress who want more flights to go into Reagan National because it's so [[06:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24696.239999999998s)]
*  convenient for them to be able to get to and from their home districts if they just cross the river [[06:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=24703.44s)]

*  the two aircraft running into each other. I'm wondering what caused the helicopter itself [[06:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25049.76s)]
*  to not even turn, to probably not even see that other airplane. And as you saw, they continued on [[06:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25057.280000000002s)]
*  with their airspeed. They didn't adjust or turn or do anything. So based on that, I'm wondering if [[06:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25064.0s)]
*  potentially they confused the aircraft that you saw on takeoff with the one they thought they [[06:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25071.52s)]

*  about a thousand flying hours. The other pilot had about 500 hours, which is considered pretty [[06:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25102.64s)]
*  experienced. He said that this corridor is a pretty easy route, is taken almost daily. He did [[06:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25108.08s)]
*  say that the ceiling for military helicopters is about 200 feet, and it's unclear at what height [[06:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25117.52s)]
*  this military helicopter was flying. The investigation is going to look at what the crew was hearing, [[06:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25125.280000000002s)]

*  Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us here on CBS News 24 seven. I'm Lindsay Reiser. We continue to cover the tragedy just outside our nation's capital. The first commercial airline disaster in the U.S. in 16 years. Search and recovery efforts are underway in Washington after that deadly crash between a military aircraft and a regional American Airlines plane last night. While emergency crews are searching the Potomac River to find the crash [[07:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25562.48s)]
*  victims, we are going to show you video now, courtesy of Earth Cam that shows the moment of the collision. The jet was on course approaching Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Virginia, coming from Wichita, Kansas. 60 passengers were believed to be on board the American Airlines flight along with four crew members. Three soldiers are said to have been on board the military helicopter. Officials say roughly 30 bodies have been recovered so far, including all three soldiers. This is radar video from the control room. [[07:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25592.48s)]
*  The control tower as crews monitor the situation shows the two closing in on one another before the crash. The president spoke to the tragedy earlier today. The work is now shifted to a recovery mission. Sadly, there are no survivors. [[07:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25622.48s)]
*  This was a dark and excruciating night in our nation's capital and in our nation's history and a tragedy of terrible proportions. As one nation, we grieve for every precious soul that has been taken from us so suddenly. And we are a country of really we are in mourning. [[07:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25640.72s)]
*  Skylar Henry is at Reagan National Airport, which reopened just a few hours ago. Skylar, where do things stand in the investigation? [[07:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25664.24s)]
*  Right, Lindsay. Well, the NTSB is leading this investigation. We actually anticipate hearing from them during a press conference later on in this hour. We heard from officials earlier today who have described what it has been like in this recovery mission and their efforts as they have worked [[07:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25673.920000000002s)]
*  through the night, hours trying to get through the records to see if there were at the time any survivors. Now, as you heard from President Trump in the briefing room there, this is now a recovery mission. They say that because of what the conditions were at that time and where they stand today, it is certainly very difficult for anyone to survive. We know that people, or we know that crews say that they have recovered at least 30 bodies. [[07:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25690.32s)]
*  DC's Mayor Mirro Bouser told Art Nicole Skanga earlier today on CBS News 24 seven that they will continue to work until all of those bodies are recovered. They also talked about what it's been like trying to console the families here who were waiting. Remember, this flight was minutes away from landing here at Reagan National Airport. And so there are countless family members here that were supposed to be picking up their loved ones and take them back to their respective homes and locations. And so now this is not only [[07:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25717.08s)]
*  a recovery effort, but also one where this community in this area is trying to wrap their arms around all of these families that are looking for answers, trying to figure out where to go, what to do, how to get any sort of support. Because this is something that obviously was not expected, but also they don't know what to do next. Obviously, these bodies are being recovered, but we're also still looking for answers as to how something like this has happened. We know that this is a what officials have referred to as a congestive [[07:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25747.08s)]
*  airspace in that there is commercial aircraft that come to this location, military aircraft that come to this location. But there are also several operations training missions that happen throughout the day. And, you know, throughout, you know, it's relatively normal having lived here in Washington, D.C. And so to see something like this happen, to know the work that air traffic control has to do in order to make sure that this place runs smoothly. There are certainly a lot of questions that members of the Trump administration that includes Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, as well as Transportation [[07:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25777.08s)]
*  Secretary Sean Duffy and others say that they want to get to the bottom. What do we know about the victims? [[07:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25807.08s)]
*  Well, we're learning a little bit more. We know that there were several high profile figure skaters that were on board, both U.S. nationals as well as Russian nationals. In fact, President Trump spoke about that during that briefing earlier today. He also said that several other [[07:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25815.68s)]
*  international flyers were on board that regional jet as well. He was yet to release or announced where and what those countries may be. But we are also hearing from several other civic groups. We've heard from union members who say that some of their members were on board this flight as well. [[07:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25831.88s)]
*  Yet to release any official names at this point. But in the hours following this incident, we know that this is something that is impacting not only those in the United States, but also the United States of America. [[07:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25851.280000000002s)]
*  We've heard from people in Kansas, but people here in the Washington, D.C. area and obviously an international perspective as well. [[07:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25861.280000000002s)]
*  Skyler, we did hear from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in a video message posted to social media earlier today. Let's listen to that. [[07:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25869.280000000002s)]
*  It was a fairly experienced crew and it was doing a required annual night evaluation. They did have night vision goggles. [[07:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25878.280000000002s)]
*  The 12th Aviation Battalion, as of now, has granted a 48-hour operational pause on contingency missions as what happened is reviewed. [[07:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25886.68s)]
*  Now, he was also with the president this afternoon calling this unacceptable, saying that they will get to the bottom of it. And he echoed the president's comments, which we will get into a bit more with Nancy Cortez, that DEI, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, has no place in government. [[07:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25896.68s)]
*  He said all employees must be colorblind and merit-based, naming air traffic controllers specifically. There's no evidence at this time suggesting the DEI initiatives played a role, but what else did Secretary Hegseth say? [[07:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25909.08s)]
*  Well, he emphasized again that the service members who were on board that Black Hawk were experienced. [[07:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25926.08s)]
*  Although it was a training exercise, did not and should not indicate the fact that they were inexperienced fliers at all. In fact, that this was a practice routine mission to nearby Fort Belvoir in Virginia. [[07:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25932.480000000003s)]
*  And this was something that they do on an annual basis. And though that they were flying at nighttime, they had their nighttime goggles as well, but also said that these were experienced military service members. [[07:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25946.480000000003s)]
*  And so he also wanted to stress that point. But again, the big question is what happened with that communication? Where did it fall off between air traffic control and the Black Hawk? [[07:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25954.88s)]
*  Many are still trying to figure out exactly what might have happened, because remember, as I pointed out, that regional jet was just moments away from landing here at Reagan. [[07:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25966.88s)]
*  And so many questions are out there as to whether there was any sort of mistakes that were made by the service members. [[07:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25974.88s)]
*  On board of that Black Hawk, or if there was something that could be done to improve the line of communication between air traffic control and those who are on board both aircraft. [[07:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25981.280000000002s)]
*  Skyler Henry, thank you. Let's bring in Captain Mike Cofield for more on this. He is a principal for Coast to Coast Strategies and a retired veteran of the airline industry with more than 30 years of commercial experience. [[07:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=25994.280000000002s)]
*  Captain, thank you for being with us on such a somber day for our country. What is your initial reaction and early assessment based on what we know? [[07:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26002.68s)]
*  Well, first of all, thoughts and prayers go out to those families. I spent 31 years with United flying over 22,000 hours. [[07:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26012.68s)]
*  One thing that I thought of initially as I looked at my wife and my kids and my grandkids today was that I was a little bit worried about the future. [[07:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26020.68s)]
*  It was really important when I said hello, when I said goodbye. [[07:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26029.08s)]
*  Those crews, every day when they go to work and when they come home, their families are impacted dramatically. [[07:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26037.08s)]
*  And it came back home to us and especially as we run our current airline KM cargo. [[07:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26045.08s)]
*  The helicopter was where it was supposed to be in terms of the route. [[07:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26051.480000000003s)]
*  I think there is some conversation relative to the fact that there were aircraft lining up to land to the north and as they do, unrulying one zero. [[07:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26061.480000000003s)]
*  Some of the regional jets have an opportunity given to them as long as traffic available to do a half circle route and then run to the north. [[07:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26073.480000000003s)]
*  And the runway three three, it's done with smaller aircraft, our regional jets. [[07:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26081.480000000003s)]
*  And I don't believe that the helicopter or the or the airliner saw either each other at all. [[07:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26087.480000000003s)]
*  And you just mentioned to what the president has spoken of. I think they're going to go back and look at ATC training. [[07:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26097.480000000003s)]
*  When those red lights are on, that's actually an alert that the controller is seeing on his screen. [[07:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26103.88s)]
*  But he's also looking out the window of the cab of the tower. [[07:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26109.88s)]
*  Now, I think they used to be you would go to Oklahoma City to the training center and you'd spend four months, five months in training in Oklahoma City. [[07:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26113.88s)]
*  And then you would go to a facility like to give you an example, maybe Leesburg or a smaller Knoxville, Tennessee. [[07:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26123.88s)]
*  You go to a smaller airport and then get trained to be qualified at a larger facility. [[07:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26132.280000000002s)]
*  That's not what's been occurred over the last few years. [[07:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26138.280000000002s)]
*  What's happened is they've shortened the time in Oklahoma City and they've actually demanded or made training available at the local facility where a senior ATC person within do training on the job, so to speak. [[07:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26142.280000000002s)]
*  I've always thought that, especially over the last 10 years or so, that that's really not a very good plan, that they ought to go back to the original plan. [[07:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26156.68s)]
*  Captain, it's been six years since the last sort of collision like this happened. How rare is something like this? [[07:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26164.68s)]
*  In the United States, it's almost, it almost never happens. [[07:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26172.68s)]
*  I mean, if you think about 31 years, I mean, there's only a handful of opportunities, times it's something like this happened. [[07:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26176.68s)]
*  Overseas, you had the Korean incident just eight weeks ago, but domestic travel in the United States is incredibly safe. [[07:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26185.08s)]
*  Professional aviators, professional maintenance, no shortcuts, safety's first, and no questions to the captain if it's not safe. [[07:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26193.08s)]
*  So I think those are things that are true. [[07:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26203.08s)]
*  I just don't think that, and one of the things I'm going to communicate back to the NTSB and especially to Senator Jerry Moran [[07:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26207.480000000003s)]
*  and an aside to that is that he is the new chairman of the Commerce Aviation Subcommittee and he is from Kansas. [[07:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26215.480000000003s)]
*  And he's also the most knowledgeable aviation expert in the United States Congress. [[07:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26223.480000000003s)]
*  And he's got a heart that's unbelievable. So that's good news. And the history of Kansas relative to aviation. [[07:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26229.88s)]
*  My dad, B-29 was made in Kansas. [[07:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26235.88s)]
*  Aviation is ingrained in that region. So I think there are some good things that are going to come out of this. [[07:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26241.88s)]
*  We hope that the president chooses and encourages the chair of the board of the NTSB to handle this in the GO team. [[07:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26249.88s)]
*  I don't know what they've decided yet this morning, this afternoon, but it's my hope that the chairman takes over this [[07:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26258.280000000002s)]
*  since DCA is owned by the federal government and Congress is responsible. [[07:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26264.280000000002s)]
*  All right. Well, Captain Mike Kovac, we have to leave it there today, but hopefully we can have you back on to discuss this tragedy. [[07:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26268.280000000002s)]
*  Thank you for your time, sir. [[07:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26274.280000000002s)]
*  Sure. Thank you so much. [[07:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26276.280000000002s)]
*  A short time ago, President Trump spoke about the crash and his first appearance in the White House briefing room since being sworn in for a second term. [[07:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26278.280000000002s)]
*  Without evidence, he shifted blame to his two Democratic predecessors, as well as diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. [[07:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26284.68s)]
*  We must have only the highest standards for those who work in our aviation system. [[07:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26290.68s)]
*  I changed the Obama standards from very mediocre at best to extraordinary. [[07:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26294.68s)]
*  And then when I left office and Biden took over, he changed them back to lower than ever before. [[07:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26300.68s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News. Chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes. [[07:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26311.08s)]
*  Nancy, the president slammed the Obama and Biden administrations. [[07:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26313.08s)]
*  He seemed to insinuate they loosened standards for air traffic controllers and FAA employees in the name of DEI. [[07:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26317.08s)]
*  He also slammed former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. [[07:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26323.08s)]
*  What did he say? And is there currently any evidence to support that standards have gone down and may have contributed to this? [[07:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26327.08s)]
*  There isn't any indication, Lindsay, that the standards have changed markedly. [[07:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26333.08s)]
*  In fact, sources have told me that the standards for air traffic controllers have always been quite high [[07:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26339.480000000003s)]
*  and that they need to go through rigorous mental and physical testing to get the job in the first place. [[07:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26345.480000000003s)]
*  And so we're still looking into what the president might have been referring to when he talked about those changes in standards. [[07:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26353.480000000003s)]
*  But more broadly, what I think stood out to a lot of reporters in the room was that on one hand, [[07:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26359.480000000003s)]
*  the president was saying that he still doesn't know what led to this particular crash [[07:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26365.88s)]
*  and then at the same time saying that DEI was somehow to blame. [[07:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26371.88s)]
*  What we know so far, and I know you've been discussing it on the show, [[07:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26375.88s)]
*  is that according to the military, the Black Hawk pilots were actually quite experienced [[07:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26379.88s)]
*  and American Airlines says that the pilots involved in the crash were experienced as well. [[07:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26385.88s)]
*  One had six years with the airline, the other had nearly two years with the airline. [[07:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26392.280000000002s)]
*  We don't know much about the air traffic controllers involved, [[07:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26398.280000000002s)]
*  but I can tell you that because Reagan National has such a complicated approach, [[07:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26400.280000000002s)]
*  as we've been discussing over the past 12 hours or so, [[07:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26406.280000000002s)]
*  the air traffic controllers who are chosen for Reagan National tend to be quite experienced as well. [[07:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26410.280000000002s)]
*  It's unclear at this point where the president is getting the information that he is using [[07:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26418.68s)]
*  to describe this as somehow a failure related to DEI. [[07:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26427.239999999998s)]
*  We pressed him repeatedly about that today, but he said that the reason he knows it is because [[07:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26430.44s)]
*  he's a smart person and not because of any particular information that he was willing to share. [[07:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26436.6s)]
*  Right, saying he has common sense. [[07:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26440.84s)]
*  Nancy, Sean Duffy is in his second day as transportation secretary. [[07:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26442.68s)]
*  He reiterated this shouldn't have happened. [[07:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26446.199999999997s)]
*  He also doubled down on the president's comments that we can only have the best and brightest. [[07:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26448.28s)]
*  The president also named a new acting administrator of the SAA. [[07:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26452.28s)]
*  What will both of their roles be in this? [[07:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26455.48s)]
*  Well, they're going to have to grapple with some very difficult decisions in the near term. [[07:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26458.68s)]
*  This will obviously reignite questions, Lindsay, about congestion at Reagan National Airport. [[07:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26464.28s)]
*  It's so uniquely situated, so close to downtown D.C., so close to multiple military bases where [[07:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26470.68s)]
*  helicopters take off and land. [[07:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26480.6s)]
*  Through the years, there has always been a major fight on Capitol Hill [[07:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26483.4s)]
*  between members of Congress who want more flights to go into Reagan National because [[07:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26488.04s)]
*  it's so convenient for them to be able to get to and from their home districts. [[07:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26494.84s)]
*  If they just cross the river from the Capitol and quickly get to Reagan National. [[07:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26499.88s)]
*  The lawmakers from Virginia, where Reagan National is located, who say it's too busy already, [[07:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26505.32s)]
*  it's difficult to control the flow of aircraft and they don't want to see it get any more congested. [[07:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26511.72s)]
*  That is something that the FAA and the secretary of transportation are certainly going to be [[07:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26517.72s)]
*  dealing with in the coming weeks and months. [[07:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26521.64s)]
*  Okay, Nancy Cordes, thank you. [[07:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26523.4s)]
*  Former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg responded to President Trump's comments in a [[07:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26525.0s)]
*  social media post. [[07:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26529.719999999998s)]
*  He called the president's words despicable and he defended his leadership, saying his [[07:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26531.0s)]
*  department put safety first, drove down close calls and grew air traffic control. [[07:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26535.16s)]
*  He also emphasized that they, quote, had zero commercial airline crash fatalities out of [[07:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26539.64s)]
*  millions of flights on our watch, end quote. [[07:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26543.879999999997s)]

*  You don't have to know everybody to feel that connection. [[07:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26768.6s)]
*  We've been through the same thing, that training, that rigorous schedule of falling over and over [[07:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26771.88s)]
*  and somehow picking yourself back up, which is like the main lesson I think learned in skating is [[07:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26779.719999999998s)]
*  you get back up, keep on trying. [[07:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26785.32s)]
*  And even when it's hard, you get back up. [[07:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26788.2s)]
*  Even when you're crying, hurt, pain, you get back up and move forward. [[07:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26791.48s)]
*  It's not easy, but that's what we all have to do now together. [[07:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26797.0s)]
*  That was former Olympic figure skater Nancy Kerrigan speaking about some of the passengers [[07:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26802.36s)]
*  aboard the plane that crashed. [[07:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26806.28s)]
*  As we mentioned, some of them were current American and Russian skaters. [[07:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26808.04s)]
*  US Figure Skating released a statement saying in part, quote, [[07:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26811.4s)]
*  we are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims' families closely in our hearts. [[07:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26814.760000000002s)]
*  We will continue to monitor the situation and will release more information as it becomes available. [[07:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26820.52s)]
*  The Blackhawk helicopter involved in the deadly midair collision was carrying three soldiers. [[07:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26825.08s)]
*  This morning, a pilot who flew the same type of aircraft spoke to CBS Mornings. [[07:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26829.96s)]
*  My first impressions were based on the video that I think everybody has seen right now at night with [[07:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26834.84s)]
*  the two aircraft running into each other. I'm wondering what caused the helicopter itself [[07:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26840.04s)]
*  to not even turn, to probably not even see that other airplane. [[07:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26847.64s)]
*  And as you saw, they continued on with their airspeed. They didn't adjust or turn or do anything. [[07:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26852.039999999997s)]
*  So based on that, I'm wondering if potentially they confused the aircraft that you saw on takeoff [[07:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26858.12s)]
*  with the one they thought they were supposed to follow behind per the air traffic control directions. [[07:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26866.12s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News Pentagon reporter Ellie Watson. Ellie, you've been on a Blackhawk. [[07:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26871.079999999998s)]
*  What can you tell us and what else are we hearing from Defense Department officials? [[07:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26874.76s)]
*  We just spoke to an Army official, a retired aviator with more than 30 years of experience, [[07:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26879.239999999998s)]
*  who knows of the crew members on this Blackhawk that crashed last night. [[07:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26884.359999999997s)]
*  He said that the crew was very experienced, that one of the pilots had about a thousand flying [[07:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26888.6s)]
*  hours. The other pilot had about 500 hours, which is considered pretty experienced. He said that the [[07:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26894.12s)]
*  corridor is a pretty easy route, is taken almost daily. He did say that the ceiling for military [[07:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26901.0s)]
*  helicopters is about 200 feet, and it's unclear at what height this military helicopter was flying. [[07:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26909.64s)]
*  The investigation is going to look at what the crew was hearing. [[07:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26918.68s)]
*  If CBS News special report, I'm Lindsay Reiser at CBS News headquarters in New York. The National [[07:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26925.879999999997s)]
*  Transportation Safety Board is giving an update on the air disaster last night near Washington. [[07:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26930.68s)]
*  Let's listen. The National Transportation Safety Board is an independent federal agency that's [[07:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26935.239999999998s)]
*  charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation and serious accident and serious [[07:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26940.36s)]
*  incident in the United States and significant events in other modes of transportation. [[07:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26947.079999999998s)]
*  I want to start by expressing our deepest condolences, our sympathies on behalf of the entire board [[07:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26953.24s)]
*  for those who lost loved ones in this terrible tragedy. Our thoughts, our prayers are with you, [[07:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26964.68s)]
*  entire communities were affected, and we are thinking of you. [[07:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26973.320000000003s)]
*  With me today is Bryce Banning. Bryce is a senior aircraft accident investigator with the [[07:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26978.600000000002s)]
*  National Transportation Safety Board. He's also going to serve as our investigator in charge of [[07:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26985.88s)]
*  this investigation. Also with me today is the entire board. We have Todd Inman, member Todd [[07:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=26991.88s)]
*  Inman. Todd is going to serve as the board member on scene, the spokesperson for this investigation. [[07:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27001.72s)]
*  All of the board members will be here. We have vice chairman Alvin Brown, member Mike Graham, [[07:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27012.68s)]
*  who lived in Wichita for 20 years, and we also have member Tom Chapman. The NTSB's headquarters [[07:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27019.960000000003s)]
*  is just a mile from here. And so we are all here because this is an all hands on deck event. [[07:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27029.88s)]
*  And we're here to assure the American people that we are going to leave no stone unturned [[07:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27039.719999999998s)]
*  in this investigation. We are going to conduct a thorough investigation of this entire tragedy [[07:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27047.88s)]
*  looking at the facts. Now with that, I want to level set. When we go to the scene, and we were [[07:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27055.399999999998s)]
*  here last night, we allow the responders to do their important safety mission, which in this case [[07:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27063.239999999998s)]
*  was search and rescue and recovery. We stand back to allow them to do their important safety mission. [[07:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27071.879999999997s)]
*  And so this for us is our first full day on scene with our entire crew coming together. [[07:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27080.2s)]
*  We have about nearly 50 people on scene, and in addition to our resources back at headquarters [[07:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27087.56s)]
*  in our labs and throughout the agency. So with that said, we are not going to get into specific [[07:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27096.04s)]
*  facts in this press conference. I want to level set here. We're going to get into our investigative [[07:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27105.4s)]
*  process. As we are able to confirm factual information, we will provide that. I do want to [[07:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27112.36s)]
*  say this is a whole of government effort. I was able to brief along with others the president [[07:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27120.760000000002s)]
*  of the United States and the vice president this afternoon. I want to thank them for their [[07:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27130.12s)]
*  leadership, for their tremendous support of the NTSB, for our investigators and for the responders [[07:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27137.719999999998s)]
*  that are on scene doing an important mission. I also want to thank secretary Sean Duffy, who I was [[07:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27146.2s)]
*  communicating with early on after we first got word of this tragedy. We've been working [[07:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27153.719999999998s)]
*  together throughout the day along with his team at the DOT and within FAA. I also want to thank [[07:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27160.039999999997s)]
*  secretary Pete Hegseth, who was also integral in working with us today. Chris Rochello, the acting [[07:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27167.64s)]
*  administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. We've heard from many members of Congress on both [[07:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27176.039999999997s)]
*  sides of the aisle. I will say this is a tremendous, one more time, whole of government effort. [[07:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27182.68s)]
*  I also want to take a moment and thank the many, many responders that have been on scene. [[07:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27190.760000000002s)]
*  It has been an incredible effort. I will have a full list that I will provide, [[07:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27199.8s)]
*  that we will provide tomorrow, but I do want to thank them for all their work. [[07:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27207.32s)]
*  With that, I'm going to turn it over to member Inman for additional remarks. [[07:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27212.28s)]
*  So today is our first day on scene. Our investigative team will be on scene as long as it takes [[07:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27226.440000000002s)]
*  in order to obtain all of the perishable evidence and all the fact-finding that is needed [[07:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27233.64s)]
*  to bring us to a conclusion of probable cause. Our mission is to understand not just what happened, [[07:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27238.44s)]
*  but why it happened, and to recommend changes to prevent it from happening again. [[07:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27245.48s)]
*  Since we're just beginning our investigation, we don't have a great deal of information to share [[07:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27251.88s)]
*  right now. We will keep you informed by giving regular updates as we learn more. Our intention [[07:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27256.28s)]
*  is to have a preliminary report within 30 days, and the final report will be issued once we've [[07:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27261.64s)]
*  completed all of our fact-finding and investigation. Now, we will not be determining the probable cause [[07:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27268.68s)]
*  of the accident while we are here on scene, nor will we speculate about what may have caused this [[07:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27276.12s)]
*  accident. Today, we will be going and having an organizational meeting and establishing our parties [[07:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27281.559999999998s)]
*  to our investigation. We currently have the following parties that are already identified. [[07:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27288.6s)]
*  PSA Airlines, GE Aerospace, Sikorsky, FAA, NACDA, which represents the air traffic controllers, [[07:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27295.239999999998s)]
*  ALPA, which represents the pilots, ARMY, AFA, which represents the flight attendants. [[07:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27306.92s)]
*  The Transportation Safety Board of Canada will be an accredited representative [[07:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27313.8s)]
*  under Annex 13 of ICAO. They will be supplemented by MHIRG as a technical advisor. [[07:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27318.6s)]
*  They were previously known as Bombardier. The NTSB offers this party status to those companies, [[07:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27326.44s)]
*  government agencies, and associations that have employees, activities, or equipment involved in [[07:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27335.08s)]
*  the accident. We offer that because they will provide technical expertise and relevant information [[07:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27340.52s)]
*  supporting the development of the best possible factual record. Once they join this investigation, [[07:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27346.760000000002s)]
*  they are not permitted to release documents or talk publicly about the investigation [[07:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27353.8s)]
*  without the consent of the NTSB. So, I want to stress this. It is only the NTSB that will provide [[07:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27358.36s)]
*  information related to this investigation, with one exception, regarding the fatalities that occurred. [[07:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27365.72s)]
*  That notification will be handled by the D.C. medical examiner. We will not be discussing [[07:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27372.84s)]
*  fatalities or names. That will be handled by them as the proper authority. [[07:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27377.56s)]
*  So, we want to talk a little bit about our process. We will analyze the facts and determine the [[07:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27383.48s)]
*  probable cause of the accident and then issue a report of those determinations. I also want to [[07:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27388.920000000002s)]
*  talk a little bit about some additional people that are here with us and they're very important [[07:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27395.56s)]
*  to us, and that is our family assistance group. Later today, we will be briefing the families. [[07:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27399.0s)]
*  We normally try to do this before a media event, but in this case, they're still arriving. [[07:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27406.04s)]
*  Our family assistant specialists are already working closely with local officials and others [[07:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27412.2s)]
*  to help assist them in their efforts to support everyone that's affected by this accident. [[07:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27416.600000000002s)]
*  And let me just reiterate what the chair said. [[07:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27421.56s)]
*  A loss of life in an aviation accident is very unusual in the United States, [[07:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27427.72s)]
*  and our heartfelt sorrow goes out to everyone that's affected. It affects us, [[07:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27432.52s)]
*  affects everyone around us. There are a lot of people hurting today. [[07:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27436.280000000002s)]
*  We will help find out what happened. We will do it factually and we will do it accurately. [[07:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27440.52s)]
*  As part of this, we are going to be standing up some specific working groups. [[07:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27447.88s)]
*  Those working groups will be operations. They will be looking at the history of the accident [[07:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27452.52s)]
*  flight and crew members duties for as many days before the crash as appears relevant. [[07:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27457.640000000003s)]
*  We'll be forming a structures group, which will be the documentation of the airframe wreckage [[07:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27464.68s)]
*  and the accident scene, including calculation of impact angles to help determine the plane's [[07:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27469.24s)]
*  pre-impact course and altitude. We'll have a power plants group. They will do the examination of the [[07:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27474.920000000002s)]
*  engines and the engine accessories. We'll have a systems group. They will study the components of [[07:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27481.72s)]
*  the plane's hydraulic, electrical, pneumatic, and associated systems, together with the instruments [[07:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27488.36s)]
*  and elements of the flight control system. We'll have an air traffic control group. They will do [[07:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27494.28s)]
*  reconstruction and review of air traffic control systems provided to and including acquisition of [[07:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27500.2s)]
*  pertinent flight track surveillance information, what you might typically think of as radar or [[07:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27505.96s)]
*  ADS-B, along with controller pilot communications. We will also have a survival factors group. [[07:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27510.920000000002s)]
*  They will be doing the documentation of impact forces and injuries, community emergency planning, [[07:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27518.600000000002s)]
*  and all crash and fire rescue efforts. Also, due to the unique nature of this crash, [[07:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27524.28s)]
*  we will be having a helicopter group as well. [[07:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27532.039999999997s)]
*  Lastly, we will have a human performance group, and this will not be its own group. It will [[07:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27536.92s)]
*  actually be a part of the operations, air traffic control, and helicopter groups. They will study [[07:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27541.399999999998s)]
*  the crew performance and all before the accident factors that might be involved in human error. [[07:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27548.52s)]
*  Including fatigue, medication, medical histories, training, workload, equipment design, and work [[07:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27554.28s)]
*  environment. Now we're going to take a few questions, but I will again stress we don't [[07:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27560.68s)]
*  have a lot of information now. We will continue to gather that. We will try to release it as we can, [[07:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27568.199999999997s)]
*  but we will only talk about the facts of the case that we know right now. [[07:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27574.76s)]
*  I'm going to ask, we'll call on a few people. I'm going to ask that you state your name, [[07:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27579.96s)]
*  affiliation. James Matthews, we've heard from President Trump today talking about DEI hiring [[07:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27583.0s)]
*  policies within the FAA and associating that with the cause of this accident. What do you say to that? [[07:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27591.56s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, I didn't hear the remarks. I was briefing House and Senate members, [[07:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27600.2s)]
*  but I believe Chair would like to take them. As part of any investigation, we look at the human, [[07:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27603.8s)]
*  the machine, and the environment. So we will look at all the humans that were involved in this [[07:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27610.68s)]
*  accident. Again, we will look at the aircraft. We will look at the helicopter. We will look at [[07:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27617.16s)]
*  the environment in which they were operating in. That is standard in any part of our investigation. [[07:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27622.28s)]
*  I'll turn it back. Chair, can I ask you, has the flight data recorder been recovered yet, and what [[07:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27628.68s)]
*  is the difficulty in a water disaster like this, which presents a very difficult environment for [[07:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27634.76s)]
*  your investigators and the people out of the water right now? Well, the question was on the flight data [[07:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27640.92s)]
*  recorders. We have not recovered the flight data recorders yet. We know they're there. They are [[07:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27646.28s)]
*  underwater. This is not unusual for the NTSB. We have many times recovered flight data recorders in [[07:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27654.199999999997s)]
*  water. We have our lab right here that is about a mile from the NTSB, so it's not unusual. Once we [[07:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27662.6s)]
*  get those, we'll be able to get those read and information from them to be able to provide further [[07:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27670.28s)]
*  information to you. Chair, I'm going to turn it back over to Member Inland. Hey there. Skyler Henry [[07:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27679.32s)]
*  with CBS News. Earlier today, Defense Secretary Pete Hexs said a mistake was made last night. [[07:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27686.68s)]
*  Based off of you all's initial investigations and preliminary findings, have you all been able to [[07:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27692.600000000002s)]
*  tell whether this was human error or a mechanical failure? The question was, is there been human [[07:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27697.48s)]
*  error or mechanical failure? We don't know what we know just yet. We do not know enough facts to be [[07:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27702.44s)]
*  able to rule in or out human factor, mechanical factors. That is part of the NTSB investigative [[07:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27707.8s)]
*  process, and where all of these groups will come together. It's one of the reasons why the NTSB is [[07:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27714.84s)]
*  known as the gold standard. We will take the time that's necessary, but I'd also like to reiterate, [[07:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27719.56s)]
*  if we find something that is a significant issue that warrants immediate action, we will not [[07:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27724.440000000002s)]
*  hesitate to make those recommendations and make them public. We have a good track record on that, [[07:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27730.440000000002s)]
*  and we want to continue doing so. Sir? Hello, sir. Tom Costello with NBC News. Does it hurt [[07:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27734.84s)]
*  your investigative process, maybe for the chairman, does it hurt your investigative process to have the [[07:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27741.16s)]
*  president already suggesting possible causes here as you try to keep an open mind and begin this [[07:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27745.8s)]
*  investigation? Thank you, sir. Tom, with all due respect, I think the press also likes to [[07:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27751.88s)]
*  state what probable cause is before we get to the probable cause. So what I'm going to say is you [[07:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27761.239999999998s)]
*  need to give us time. You need to give NTSB, it's not that we don't have information. We do have [[07:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27766.84s)]
*  information. We have data. We have substantial amounts of information. We need to verify [[07:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27773.0s)]
*  information. We need to take our time to make sure it is accurate. That's best for you. That's [[07:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27779.0s)]
*  important for the families. It's important for legislators who are seeking answers to try to [[07:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27787.48s)]
*  figure out what they're going to do about this, and so it will take time. We do have a lot of [[07:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27792.52s)]
*  information, but we need some time to verify that. Yeah, member Chase Williams with Fox Business. [[07:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27797.88s)]
*  I'm wondering about the conditions in the tower last night. Were there any performance issues in [[07:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27807.24s)]
*  the past with any of these controllers, anything of that nature? The question is about controllers. [[07:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27811.8s)]
*  As I said, we are just now forming the groups. The controllers do have union representation, [[07:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27817.8s)]
*  which they are entitled to. They'll be working with our party system and our party groups. [[07:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27822.440000000002s)]
*  They'll be conducting interviews. Those interviews will need to be analyzed, transcribed, [[07:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27826.6s)]
*  and other team members will need to look over it. It'll be a long process, but we will go through [[07:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27830.76s)]
*  the entire history. Michelle Rolgray, The Independent. My question is for the chairwoman. [[07:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27834.76s)]
*  Can you tell us more about what the president and the vice president's responses were when you [[07:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27842.28s)]
*  briefed them this afternoon? Sure. So the question was about my briefing for the president and the [[07:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27845.96s)]
*  vice president. As a standard, we offer briefings on our process and what we know. This was a [[07:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27855.16s)]
*  briefing with the president and vice president and with Secretary Duffy and Secretary Hegseth and [[07:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27863.0s)]
*  also the acting administrator of the FAA. There was discussion on what we know so far [[07:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27870.84s)]
*  and our process and that was about it. [[07:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27878.52s)]
*  Madam Chairwoman, Stephanie Ramos with ABC News. Similar to Tom Costello's question, [[07:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27884.36s)]
*  the president has stated what may have caused the crash. [[07:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27889.4s)]
*  Stating common sense. Does that affect your progress at this early stage? [[07:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27893.48s)]
*  Yeah, so the NTSB, we conduct an important safety mission where we take a very careful approach. [[07:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27898.52s)]
*  I'm sorry, the question was on speculating during investigations, which is we often hear about. [[07:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27910.36s)]
*  What I will say is we look at facts on our investigation and that will take some time. [[07:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27921.72s)]
*  At some point, we'll be able to provide that factual information, as member Inman said, [[07:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27928.52s)]
*  and provide that hopefully tomorrow. [[07:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27935.16s)]
*  Have you been able to retrieve the black boxes from the helicopter as the military decided whether [[07:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27942.2s)]
*  they're going to read those or the NTSB? And what about the ATC tapes? [[07:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27947.64s)]
*  So the question was about black boxes, which are referred to as black boxes, [[07:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27952.84s)]
*  which are typically orange. We have not recovered any of the boxes involved yet. [[07:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27956.68s)]
*  We feel comfortable and confident that we will be able to right now. Recovery of life is probably [[07:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27962.2s)]
*  most important in those that were involved. I mean, there are still ongoing recovery efforts [[07:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27969.08s)]
*  involving the fatalities involved, along with some debris is coming out as well. [[07:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27975.72s)]
*  We will make sure that that perishable evidence is maintained. We have a great process for that. [[07:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27980.6s)]
*  We will probably have more than one black box, so to speak. It's our understanding that the [[07:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27987.0s)]
*  Sikorsky helicopter is equipped with some form of recording devices, and those will be read either [[07:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=27993.72s)]
*  by the DOD or by us. We have a good starting relationship with them and we've already made [[07:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28000.36s)]
*  agreements in order to be able to do that. So I feel comfortable in what we're going to be doing. [[07:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28004.6s)]
*  The other question was about air traffic control. We received a very large package of information [[07:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28009.64s)]
*  from the FAA at about 3 a.m., I believe, this morning. That is still being reviewed and analyzed. [[07:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28014.76s)]
*  I would say there's a lot more information that usually comes in that than what you may find [[07:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28021.399999999998s)]
*  online and people might speculate about. And that is part of that overall process where we take the [[07:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28025.079999999998s)]
*  time to get the information correct and to make sure all the parties are engaged, involved, [[07:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28030.84s)]
*  and can fact check that information. Gabe Cohen from CNN. Can you tell me if the NTSB has reviewed [[07:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28036.28s)]
*  this FAA internal report that has been cited by the New York Times indicating that the controller [[07:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28044.44s)]
*  that was on duty at the time of the crash was doing a job that's usually done by two people? [[07:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28050.52s)]
*  We have not reviewed any specific reports about the controllers at this time, at least from the [[07:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28057.16s)]
*  leadership team. Our investigators are continuing to pull all that information. Their personnel [[07:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28062.359999999997s)]
*  records, their files, where they were at, whether they were fatigued, all that information will be [[07:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28067.48s)]
*  part of that investigative process. But right now we can't speculate on anything that may have [[07:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28072.44s)]
*  been reported in the media until we get the opportunity to validate and understand how it [[07:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28076.44s)]
*  impacts the investigation. We're going to take just a few more questions. [[07:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28080.68s)]
*  What's the process and the logistics like of bringing the families in? Are they coming into the airport? [[07:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28084.04s)]
*  And how are you going to sort of treat the sensitivity of bringing them to the place where this [[07:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28094.760000000002s)]
*  tragedy happened? So the question is about the families. And many of those families are still [[07:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28100.600000000002s)]
*  en route. Some are still being notified from both the military and from the commercial crash. [[07:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28107.8s)]
*  There is a family assistance facility that's being stood up by American and PSA Airlines [[07:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28114.36s)]
*  in Bethesda, Maryland. They've already been working on that, standing it up. Our team from our disaster [[07:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28121.32s)]
*  assistance team has also been coordinating with them. We plan on briefing them. It is customary [[07:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28126.92s)]
*  that at some point if the families wish to go to part of the accident site that we would arrange [[07:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28133.32s)]
*  such a thing. But it will only be when we know that it's safe, we have the correct perishable [[07:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28138.6s)]
*  evidence, and we can do it in the proper modesty that should be for those family members. It will [[07:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28143.8s)]
*  be a little bit of a process, but it will take some time. [[07:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28149.079999999998s)]
*  Is there a follow-up on the air traffic control? [[07:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28152.44s)]
*  No. Sir, or you? [[07:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28153.8s)]
*  I know that we've heard from some witnesses that they saw people were able to come down the slide. [[07:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28156.52s)]
*  Is there any indication that people made it off the plane? [[07:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28164.04s)]
*  Well, again, we will not speak to the fatalities. The D.C. medical examiner will, but I think [[07:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28168.44s)]
*  the D.C. fire chief this morning very succinctly said correctly that we believe there are no [[07:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28173.64s)]
*  survivors. So hang on one second. Right now we're going through the debris fields. Nothing we've [[07:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28178.52s)]
*  seen would indicate that maybe slides or shoots were deployed. It was a very quick, rapid impact, [[07:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28190.76s)]
*  but we've seen nothing in that regard so far from the evidence we had, but we still need to verify [[07:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28197.48s)]
*  all of that information. One more question. Jeff Cook, ABC News. Go ahead. Jeff Cook, ABC News. [[07:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28202.6s)]
*  What do you know about the altitude of the helicopter at the moment of impact, and can [[07:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28211.8s)]
*  you talk about the procedure for such helicopters in that area? The question was about the helicopter [[07:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28215.079999999998s)]
*  procedures, and in D.C. it's kind of a unique environment. We've been getting briefed more and [[07:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28220.44s)]
*  more by the FAA. I'm not an air traffic control specialist, but there are actually helicopter [[07:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28224.92s)]
*  zones, if you will, or tracks, and this one was transiting, I believe, from track one to four [[07:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28229.8s)]
*  as part of their normal procedure. If you live in D.C., you see a lot of helicopters going down [[07:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28236.84s)]
*  into this area, so there's a very well-defined system in that regard. As far as altitude, until [[07:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28241.0s)]
*  we get the additional information, we can't validate or basically corroborate any of that [[07:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28246.76s)]
*  until we get more of the electronic data and the data that's on the plane. I do want to clarify [[07:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28252.519999999997s)]
*  one question that also came about cell phones. You know, in today's age and time, a lot of [[07:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28257.079999999998s)]
*  electronics and other devices do contain a lot of different information. We've found on a number of [[07:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28262.359999999997s)]
*  our accidents that we actually are notified through a smartphone that made sense that. [[07:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28267.32s)]
*  As part of our process, we will obviously treat the all of the effects of the deceased with dignity. [[07:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28272.84s)]
*  We are already starting to pull that information together. If we feel that it's necessary to find [[07:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28281.079999999998s)]
*  or pull some of that information, we will work with the families and make sure we do it in a [[07:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28286.12s)]
*  manner that's respectful for them and their privacy, but right now we don't have any plans [[07:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28291.16s)]
*  specifically on that amount on that area until we need to. Thank you very much. [[07:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28295.399999999998s)]
*  That was a briefing from the National Transportation Safety Board, including from [[07:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28302.6s)]
*  Chair Jennifer Homendy, who said this is an all hands on deck event that they will leave no stone [[07:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28307.239999999998s)]
*  unturned and will conduct a thorough investigation after last night's collision between a regional [[07:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28312.84s)]
*  American Airlines plane, which was carrying 64 people on board and a Blackhawk military [[07:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28318.12s)]
*  helicopter, which was carrying three soldiers. No survivors are believed to be injured. [[07:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28324.28s)]
*  No survivors are believed to have been found. This is now a recovery mission. [[07:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28330.68s)]
*  NTSB Chair Homendy said that today is their first full day on the scene. They have nearly 50 people [[07:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28335.64s)]
*  there. She said they wouldn't get into specific facts, only talk about their process. We did hear [[07:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28341.079999999998s)]
*  from an NTSB member, Tom Inman, who is serving as a spokesperson for this and said they will be [[07:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28346.199999999997s)]
*  determining probable cause, not just what happened, but why and also recommend changes. He said they [[07:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28351.719999999998s)]
*  said that they will be looking at everything, including looking at the helicopter, looking at [[07:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28357.0s)]
*  air traffic control, looking at the pilots on the plane, whether air traffic controllers were [[07:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28364.36s)]
*  fatigued. Now, he was asked to question any indication of whether people made it off of the [[07:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28368.28s)]
*  plane, and he said, quoting the D.C. Fire Chief, saying that he said, [[07:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28373.16s)]
*  was a rapid dissension into water. We're joined now by Laura Einstetler, a commercial airline [[07:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28387.72s)]
*  pilot with more than 30 years of flying experience. Thank you for joining us on such a tragic day. [[07:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28393.96s)]
*  What stands out to you right now based on what we know about this collision? [[07:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28400.44s)]
*  Well, as we just heard from the NTSB, there's so many different factors involved that they're [[07:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28405.4s)]
*  going to be looking at. I can only really speak to pilots' perspectives on this. I mean, [[07:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28409.96s)]
*  our number one most critical priority is keeping everyone safe at all times. And with aviation, [[07:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28416.52s)]
*  we dissect everything with a fine-tooth comb so that we can make changes going forward to help [[07:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28424.28s)]
*  best protect everyone involved. I do want to ask you about something that we heard from Senator [[07:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28429.88s)]
*  Tammy Duckworth, and that is that air traffic control spoke, contacted and spoke with the [[07:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28436.36s)]
*  helicopter crew twice. They acknowledged the instructions twice that this specific area is a [[07:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28442.28s)]
*  special flight-restricted area, and you have to fly there with additional training. There's also [[07:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28448.44s)]
*  the question of whether they were using night vision goggles, but that every member onboard [[07:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28453.239999999998s)]
*  that Black Hawk helicopter will have been tasked with also looking around and making sure there [[07:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28457.719999999998s)]
*  were no obstructions or anything. Anything from what I just said that stands out to you and what [[07:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28463.399999999998s)]
*  you've been thinking about? So we have to look and see, again, the NTSB will determine this [[07:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28467.72s)]
*  as far as accurate timing and space, where everyone was positioned at. But when you see the [[07:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28477.08s)]
*  flight tracks and you hear some of the data recordings, yes, the Black Hawk second pilot [[07:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28483.08s)]
*  had clicked on and said that, yes, they affirmatively had the regional jet in sight, [[07:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28491.16s)]
*  and that's something that they're going to look at. Was it obviously a definitive [[07:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28496.84s)]
*  thinking that they had it in sight and could have been misconstrued as something else? [[07:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28504.04s)]
*  Those are the things that as pilots, we're always looking around, making sure that everything in our [[07:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28510.28s)]
*  environment, what we're doing, how we're operating is safe. So everyone in aviation, you always work [[07:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28517.32s)]
*  toward making everything as best and safe as possible. We learn from these things and we make [[07:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28523.16s)]
*  those changes. Captain Einsetler, thank you so much. Let's go to Skylar Henry at Reagan National [[07:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28528.12s)]
*  Airport. Skylar, you were just at that press conference and you asked a specific question, [[07:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28533.239999999998s)]
*  quoting something that Defense Secretary Hex has said today, that a mistake was made. Take us [[07:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28537.8s)]
*  through your question and the response, please. Yeah, well, we asked member J. Todd Inman about [[07:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28541.72s)]
*  exactly what those mistakes could have been that Defense Secretary Pete Hex was referring to earlier [[07:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28549.32s)]
*  today. I asked whether that was a human error or whether there was some sort of mechanical failure, [[07:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28555.32s)]
*  but what we have heard from the NTSB time and again over the course of this press conference [[07:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28560.04s)]
*  was that they are going to be meticulous and make sure that they move through this investigation [[07:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28564.52s)]
*  thoroughly and slowly and before they release any of their findings, which they say will be released [[07:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28569.96s)]
*  within the next 30 days. Now, as for how they are going about this investigation, a series of steps, [[07:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28575.48s)]
*  including probable cause, they also say that they will be performing a series of groups to try to [[07:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28581.64s)]
*  reconstruct this scene and reconstruct this accident altogether. They say that they will be [[07:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28588.04s)]
*  working with groups, looking to create structure groups, to talk about impact angles, and also talk [[07:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28592.92s)]
*  about pre-impact coursing and also the altitude of not only that commercial regional jet, but also [[07:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28599.16s)]
*  of that Black Hawk helicopter. They also say that there will be a systems group where they will [[07:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28605.64s)]
*  go to and look at the air traffic control systems and review that, the radar, so to speak, [[07:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28611.96s)]
*  and they say that they will look at also the human performance group that will talk about [[07:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28617.4s)]
*  how everyone was doing, whether that is the pilots themselves, air traffic control, to [[07:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28621.72s)]
*  ensure that this is an investigation that is as thorough as possible. But one thing that I should [[07:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28625.8s)]
*  point out, Lindsay, is that the NTSB has still said that they are still bringing family members [[07:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28629.88s)]
*  here to the airport. They have not yet been in contact with everyone who could be next of [[07:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28635.48s)]
*  kin for those who may be on board or may have been on board either of those aircrafts, and so they [[07:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28641.0s)]
*  say that they are still working to try to get into contact with them. We know that there are some [[07:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28645.719999999998s)]
*  certain high-profile names that are part of it. We also know that there is an international component [[07:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28650.28s)]
*  as well, so we will see what happens as these families get the news here later on today. [[07:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28655.16s)]
*  Mr. Amon also saying they have not yet recovered the flight data recorders or the helicopter [[07:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28659.079999999998s)]
*  black boxes, that this is still an active recovery mission. Skyler Henry, thank you. [[07:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28663.72s)]
*  Let's go now to senior national security correspondent Charlie Daggett. Charlie, you have [[07:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28668.2s)]
*  more on the helicopter involved in this collision. I do, yes. This is a background briefing from an [[07:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28672.12s)]
*  army representative. Pardon me, I read my notes. This is a very experienced crew. It's been [[07:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28677.64s)]
*  described as. They would have been familiar with that route. I'll get to that in a minute. One [[07:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28683.320000000003s)]
*  pilot had 1,000 flying hours. The other had 500. He described it as a relatively easy corridor. [[07:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28687.16s)]
*  The maximum ceiling over the river at that part of the river is 200 feet. [[07:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28695.08s)]
*  Didn't want to speculate at what altitude or height the helicopter was flying. There was some [[07:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28699.800000000003s)]
*  question about night goggles and night vision that came up as well, and there are two arguments about [[07:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28706.120000000003s)]
*  that. One, they can help in a low light situation, but they can also hinder because [[07:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28712.2s)]
*  it robs you of your broad perspective looking out and seeing what's happening. So I spoke with [[07:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28717.8s)]
*  a former Black Hawk pilot a few moments ago who ran those very routes. He was part of that battalion [[07:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28725.16s)]
*  and said this is very common. It's part of their training. It's part of what they do [[07:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28733.4s)]
*  because a lot of question marks have been why are helicopters flying so close to Reagan [[07:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28738.52s)]
*  National Airport at that sort of level elevation or altitude, but this is what they train to do. [[07:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28742.84s)]
*  They train to move individuals from point A to point B oftentimes along the Potomac, and they [[07:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28749.8s)]
*  are also trained to do that if they should need to do that in an emergency. Because if you haven't [[07:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28756.120000000003s)]
*  been to the DC area, it was an eye opener for me, they're up and down the Potomac all the time and [[07:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28762.04s)]
*  right around Reagan National Airport. So that is not unique. That's a relatively common thing [[07:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28767.48s)]
*  as it's been described as routine, and they would have known that route. So really, you know, you [[07:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28772.28s)]
*  hit the nail on the head. It's not just what happened. That's pretty clear. It's why. [[07:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28777.48s)]
*  Charlie, I have to be quick with you, but you mentioned the maximum ceiling over the river [[07:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28782.04s)]
*  is 200 feet. What does that mean? Yeah, so that's as high as helicopters are supposed to go [[07:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28785.0s)]
*  within that window because the river is broken down into a couple of sections when it comes to [[07:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28790.44s)]
*  where the helicopters are flying. And as it was described from that, are you representative? [[07:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28794.76s)]
*  That is as high. That's the top of the ceiling. If they can go 200 feet. Okay, Charlie Daggett, [[07:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28798.679999999997s)]
*  thank you. Tom Hansen is at the Ashburn Ice House where he's been speaking to the very tight knit [[08:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28803.48s)]
*  community there. Tom, please explain to us why you're there, what we know about some of the [[08:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28808.679999999997s)]
*  victims and what you're hearing. Yeah, Lindsay. Well, it's an incredibly somber scene here today. [[08:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28812.519999999997s)]
*  As we got here, we have seen a steady flow of people going in and out of this skating club. [[08:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28818.68s)]
*  As we know, many of the people who are on this plane were elite ice skaters, figure skaters. [[08:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28825.48s)]
*  And so what we've seen are people bringing flowers, other forms of condolences to really [[08:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28831.64s)]
*  honor the people who have or who are believed to have passed away a growing memorial on the inside [[08:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28837.64s)]
*  of this skating rink. The people that we've spoken to relatively young, I should point out, [[08:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28844.04s)]
*  one 14 year old says that she believes that she has lost several of her best friends. Another ice [[08:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28849.559999999998s)]
*  skater as young as 10 years old saying that they believe they know people who were on this plane. [[08:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28855.96s)]
*  We're talking about competitors. We're talking about parents. We're talking about potentially [[08:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28862.6s)]
*  coaches being on this flight. One other mom and daughter that we spoke to said that they were on [[08:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28867.64s)]
*  a flight just minutes before this plane landed. They had landed from a similar path to Wichita [[08:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28874.84s)]
*  from Wichita to D.C. So also experiencing some disbelief and survivor's guilt, this community [[08:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28880.6s)]
*  absolutely reeling from this devastating loss. Lindsay, Tom Hanson, thank you so much. Our [[08:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28887.72s)]
*  coverage on this national tragedy, the crash involving a regional American Airlines flight and [[08:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28893.4s)]
*  a military Blackhawk helicopter taking place last night near Reagan National Airport. Our coverage [[08:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28898.120000000003s)]
*  will continue on CBS News 24 seven, your local news and tonight on the CBS evening news. This [[08:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28904.440000000002s)]
*  has been a CBS News special report. I'm Lindsay Reiser. [[08:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28909.640000000003s)]
*  Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us here on CBS News 24 seven. [[08:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28923.4s)]
*  I'm Lindsay Reiser. We continue to cover the tragedy just outside our nation's capital, [[08:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28953.56s)]
*  the first commercial airline disaster in the U.S. in 16 years. Search and recovery efforts [[08:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28958.04s)]
*  are underway following a deadly midair collision between a military aircraft and a regional [[08:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28963.480000000003s)]
*  American Airlines plane last night in Washington. The National Transportation Safety Board is on the [[08:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28968.36s)]
*  scene as emergency crews searched the Potomac River to find crash victims. Sixty passengers [[08:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28973.4s)]
*  were believed to be on board the American Airlines flight along with four crew members. [[08:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28979.24s)]
*  Several U.S. and Russian figure skaters were on the plane when it crashed. Additionally, [[08:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28983.640000000003s)]
*  three soldiers were on board the military helicopter. Officials say roughly 30 bodies [[08:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28988.600000000002s)]
*  have been recovered so far, including all three soldiers. This video, courtesy of Earth Cam, [[08:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28993.480000000003s)]
*  the one we're about to show you, shows the moment of collision. The jet, we're told, was on course. [[08:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=28999.56s)]
*  Here's that video approaching Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Virginia after [[08:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29004.44s)]
*  departing from Wichita, Kansas, just two hours earlier. NTSB Chairperson Jennifer [[08:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29009.239999999998s)]
*  Homendy discussed the investigation. We are all here because this is an all hands on deck event. [[08:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29014.28s)]
*  And we're here to assure the American people that we are going to leave no stone unturned [[08:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29023.399999999998s)]
*  in this investigation. We are going to conduct a thorough investigation of this entire tragedy, [[08:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29031.64s)]
*  looking at the facts. Skyler Henry was at the press conference and joins me now. Skyler, [[08:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29039.16s)]
*  what more are we learning after today's briefing about how they will go about their process? [[08:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29045.16s)]
*  Because they told us they were they were frank. Today is the first full day for them on the scene [[08:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29049.56s)]
*  and they can't be divulging any facts about the case yet. [[08:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29054.68s)]
*  Yeah, and that also includes getting in front of any sort of speculation that we have seen, [[08:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29060.28s)]
*  not only on social media, but also from members of the Trump administration. And so they say that [[08:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29064.44s)]
*  they will be taking their time, as you pointed out, this is their first full day assessing [[08:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29069.96s)]
*  exactly what happened. Interesting to note that they say that they have yet to recover any of [[08:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29075.24s)]
*  the so-called black boxes on either of the aircraft, the commercial regional jet or that [[08:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29080.2s)]
*  Black Hawk helicopter. They also say that they have yet to get to the flight data recorder, [[08:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29086.12s)]
*  which is underwater. And that is the other component to this that is so unusual, Lindsay, [[08:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29091.72s)]
*  just the fact that this was a water emergency and that crews are not only dealing with trying to [[08:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29096.12s)]
*  obviously recover as many of those bodies as possible, but also really try to get to the [[08:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29102.52s)]
*  bottom of exactly what happened here, knowing that the conditions are treacherous and the initial [[08:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29107.96s)]
*  parts of this effort. And these efforts were all happening under the cloak of darkness in those [[08:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29113.879999999997s)]
*  cold, chilly waters of the Potomac River. They also talked about what methods that they will be [[08:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29119.8s)]
*  taking moving forward in terms of this meticulous process to try to reconstruct exactly what [[08:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29124.04s)]
*  happened. And if there was any sort of fault at all, they say that they will be looking through [[08:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29128.6s)]
*  a series of groups, working groups. They say that there will be a structure group, a systems group, [[08:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29133.16s)]
*  a helicopter group, given the fact that a military helicopter was involved, but also a human [[08:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29137.4s)]
*  performance group as well. And that's interesting because I asked one of the board members, Lindsay, [[08:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29142.2s)]
*  about that earlier today. Earlier today, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth referenced that mistakes [[08:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29146.68s)]
*  were made last night. And so I asked whether that meant human error or if there were some sort of [[08:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29152.36s)]
*  mechanical failure. But of course, as I pointed out before, they did not want to get in front of any [[08:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29157.640000000003s)]
*  sort of preliminary findings. They did say that we should see something happen here within the next [[08:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29161.640000000003s)]
*  30 days as far as their initial findings and reports. But a part of that human performance [[08:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29167.800000000003s)]
*  group, they say that they will take into consideration what was going on with the pilots of both the [[08:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29172.760000000002s)]
*  commercial regional aircraft as well as the military aircraft as well. We also heard [[08:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29178.68s)]
*  that there were apparently recording devices on the military helicopter that could lend a hand [[08:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29184.84s)]
*  in terms of getting to the bottom of this investigation. And there are also reports out [[08:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29191.24s)]
*  there as well speculating about what was happening inside of air traffic control and whether that was [[08:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29195.0s)]
*  properly staffed or if there were other people that were needed given the types of aircraft and [[08:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29200.36s)]
*  the amount of operations going on here at the airport during the time of the collision. And [[08:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29205.56s)]
*  so they say that they do not want to get in front of any of that at this point. But they say that [[08:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29211.16s)]
*  they will continue to update us as quickly and as thoroughly as they can. And they also point out [[08:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29215.56s)]
*  that everyone as far as next of kin has yet to be notified. They are still working to try to [[08:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29222.76s)]
*  brief families, some of whom are still making their way to Washington, D.C. [[08:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29229.48s)]
*  in order to get briefed as to what exactly happened here. They did say that they in some [[08:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29234.359999999997s)]
*  cases make arrangements so that family members can make their way to the collision site. In this case, [[08:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29238.6s)]
*  what would be the banks of the Potomac River. But they say that there are still people still trying [[08:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29243.16s)]
*  to make their way here to Washington, D.C. They've yet to contact everyone as it relates to next of [[08:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29247.8s)]
*  kin of those who may have been on board as well. Should also point out given the fact of who at [[08:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29253.32s)]
*  least we have come to identify as far as passengers on board those aircraft. We know that there was a [[08:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29258.36s)]
*  figure skating component. Some of the top figure skaters out there from both the U.S. and from [[08:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29265.239999999998s)]
*  Russia. President Trump alluded to that earlier today during that press briefing and also talked [[08:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29270.28s)]
*  about how he and the United States would be responsible for getting those remains back to [[08:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29275.48s)]
*  Russia. He also said that there were some other passengers on board those aircraft that were from [[08:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29281.239999999998s)]
*  other countries. We're yet to see exactly where they are from as well. But it just goes to show [[08:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29286.92s)]
*  just how much work is left to do as crews and all of these administration and organizations work to [[08:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29291.16s)]
*  really try to get to the bottom of what happened. Skyler, they said that right now they are still [[08:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29298.76s)]
*  in active recovery mode but you had mentioned the flight data recorders, the black boxes on [[08:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29303.96s)]
*  the helicopter. Those still have yet to be recovered but also other kinds of evidence including [[08:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29308.44s)]
*  debris and even cell phones. What did they say about that? [[08:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29314.12s)]
*  Yeah, they said that they were going to be sensitive as it relates to passengers, cell phones, [[08:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29319.559999999998s)]
*  and also their personal belongings and how that could help with this investigation and sort of [[08:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29325.719999999998s)]
*  putting the pieces together. But they also said that what they noticed as it relates to the [[08:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29331.32s)]
*  fuselage of the commercial regional jet was that it was broken into three pieces. That's something [[08:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29338.36s)]
*  that we heard from officials within the Trump administration earlier today as well as other [[08:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29343.32s)]
*  officials who made that initial press conference here at the airport. And so they say that both the [[08:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29350.36s)]
*  aircraft, the American Airlines aircraft, as well as the military aircraft were flips upside down. [[08:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29355.8s)]
*  They also talked about the challenges given the space in this investigation because of that Potomac [[08:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29363.16s)]
*  River that I talked about. Not only is the river rushing at this current moment but it is still [[08:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29369.079999999998s)]
*  cold. It did snow here recently in Washington D.C. and so crews are working around the clock to not [[08:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29374.84s)]
*  only gather, as you pointed out, and try to recover as many bodies as possible but as much [[08:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29380.28s)]
*  evidence as possible as they look to reconstruct exactly what happened here. [[08:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29384.76s)]
*  Skyler, they were asked about whether there was any indication of whether anybody made it off of [[08:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29388.519999999997s)]
*  the plane. What was the response? Yeah. Well, they said and echoed the same sentiments as the D.C. [[08:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29394.519999999997s)]
*  Fire Chief earlier today, just given the conditions, at this point they haven't been able to determine [[08:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29405.719999999998s)]
*  whether anyone was able to make it off of the aircraft. They say it was almost an instant [[08:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29412.6s)]
*  collision and the fact that it happened the way it did, it was almost improbable, so to speak, [[08:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29417.48s)]
*  to imagine that anyone could have survived the impact of this crash. And that's something really [[08:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29424.84s)]
*  that takes your breath away, Lindsay, when you think about it given the fact that that American [[08:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29428.84s)]
*  Airlines flight was so close to landing here at the airport, minutes away even, and the fact that, [[08:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29432.76s)]
*  at least from earlier reports, every indication has said that we're talking about hundreds of [[08:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29438.92s)]
*  feet as it relates to altitude. And so because of that, they say that given the circumstances, [[08:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29445.879999999997s)]
*  given the impact and how quickly everything happened, it was pretty difficult to imagine [[08:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29452.519999999997s)]
*  that anyone could have survived what happened here last night. Such a tragedy. Skyler, Henry, [[08:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29456.679999999997s)]
*  thank you for your reporting. Let's go now to Tom Hanson, who is at the Ashburn Ice House, [[08:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29461.64s)]
*  where he's been speaking to the tight-knit community there about some of the people who [[08:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29467.4s)]
*  are believed to be victims of the crash. Tom, what are you learning so far about some of the passengers? [[08:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29471.32s)]
*  Yeah, well, what we're learning, Lindsay, is that we're having a slow trickle of names that we have [[08:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29478.84s)]
*  been able to confirm as CBS News. And I just want to kind of give you a rundown of the people that [[08:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29484.280000000002s)]
*  we do know for a fact were on this flight, this doomed flight. You know, Jenya Shishkova, [[08:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29489.88s)]
*  Nadeem Namav, they were world-class figure skaters who were reportedly on this flight. Spencer Lane, [[08:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29497.4s)]
*  a 16-year-old, and his mother, Christine Lane, they also died in the crash, and that is all [[08:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29505.24s)]
*  according to the skating club of Boston. And then, you know, not every single person on this flight, [[08:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29511.48s)]
*  however, was an ice skater. One person, Azra Hussein Raza, a 26-year-old, was among the victims [[08:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29518.68s)]
*  of the crash. She was on a work trip to Wichita. That was confirmed by her father-in-law, but there [[08:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29526.12s)]
*  are still so many people on this flight that we have not been able to confirm independently just [[08:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29532.04s)]
*  yet. And so we are waiting for those confirmations to continue coming in. As you've mentioned, over [[08:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29539.64s)]
*  60 people were on this doomed flight that crashed into the Potomac. And so, you know, here at this [[08:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29545.160000000003s)]
*  skate club, Ashburn Ice House, a place that has been deeply impacted by this devastating loss, [[08:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29551.88s)]
*  we've seen the constant trickle of people coming in, many of whom have flowers in hand [[08:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29561.08s)]
*  to pay their respects in a makeshift memorial, people who are just sobbing and crying and [[08:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29568.2s)]
*  shattered. And I just want to outline exactly the tight-knit community that we're looking at [[08:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29574.2s)]
*  here. We are talking about people that not only compete together, they travel together, [[08:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29578.440000000002s)]
*  they study together, they train together. And so they are spending a lot of time together. [[08:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29583.56s)]
*  And they also know a lot of other skaters from across the country. This is something that spans [[08:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29588.600000000002s)]
*  not just the D.C. area, but from Boston and elsewhere in Virginia. So we're talking about [[08:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29594.280000000002s)]
*  people who are experiencing grief and loss that they are just beginning to grasp in the early [[08:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29601.24s)]
*  hours of this tragedy. Lindsay? Do we have any sense? We know we just heard from the NTSB [[08:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29607.56s)]
*  press briefing that the Washington, D.C. medical examiner will be releasing names and identities [[08:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29613.08s)]
*  of the victims. Do we have any sense of a timeline on when that will happen? [[08:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29618.84s)]
*  I mean, as we heard from Skylar Henry earlier, just outlining the challenges that [[08:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29624.36s)]
*  the first responders are encountering when it comes to recovering some of the bodies from this [[08:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29630.2s)]
*  crash, it's really anybody's guess. We're getting a slow trickle of information that we are then [[08:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29637.72s)]
*  being tasked with verifying independently, as we should as a news organization. And so it's really [[08:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29644.68s)]
*  unclear when we're going to get a full list, but we are still in the very early phase of identifying [[08:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29651.48s)]
*  just every single person, every life that was lost from this devastating crash. And I can tell [[08:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29657.08s)]
*  you that, you know, we're waiting for answers where we are, the people who are coming in here [[08:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29663.96s)]
*  and coping with this loss, they are also waiting for answers. As of now, we are very much in the [[08:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29670.12s)]
*  early phase of that, Lindsay. OK, Tom Hanson, thank you. While I was discussing with Tom, [[08:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29676.44s)]
*  we did get word CBS News confirms via two sources that one air traffic control worker was managing [[08:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29681.96s)]
*  helicopters and planes, a job normally done by two people. This was first reported by the New York [[08:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29688.84s)]
*  Times. We are obviously going to have much more on our live coverage of the Reagan National Airport [[08:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29694.28s)]
*  crash. Our coverage continues next. For now, we're going to take a break. You're watching CBS News 24 7. [[08:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29700.04s)]
*  Is there no room for debate on college campuses anymore? 60 Minutes brings you to the new university [[08:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29711.96s)]
*  that is demanding it. The stakes are that high. If our universities are screwed up, and I believe [[08:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29729.16s)]
*  they are, then that will screw up America as a whole quite quickly. [[08:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29733.96s)]

*  that it's unpredictable and uncontrollable. The choices we make now will have lasting effects [[08:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29776.359999999997s)]

*  I think I asked direct questions. I don't know that they're tough questions per se. What price [[08:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29788.199999999997s)]

*  Welcome back to CBS News 24 7. I'm Lindsay Reiser. We continue to follow the deadly collision [[08:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29899.08s)]
*  between a regional American Airlines plane and an Army Black Hawk helicopter that took place [[08:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29910.52s)]
*  shortly before at 9 p.m. local time last night. The Black Hawk helicopter involved was carrying [[08:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29915.640000000003s)]
*  three soldiers. Let's bring in CBS News Pentagon reporter Eleanor Watson. Ellie, what are you [[08:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29921.72s)]
*  hearing from Pentagon officials? Yeah, the Pentagon is still investigating this incident. [[08:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29926.84s)]
*  The latest we've heard was from an Army official who has more than 30 years of aviation experience [[08:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29934.12s)]
*  and who knew of members of the crew. He said it was a very experienced crew. He said that the [[08:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29939.88s)]
*  corridor they were flying on on the Potomac River around Reagan Airport is a corridor used pretty [[08:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29946.2s)]
*  often daily and there shouldn't have been a problem flying this particular route. Now, [[08:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29954.36s)]
*  what investigators will look at is whether the helicopter was abiding by the ceiling, the restricted [[08:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29961.4s)]
*  altitude near that area. We've been told by U.S. officials that helicopters are supposed to only [[08:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29970.600000000002s)]
*  fly about 200 feet off the ground in that area by the airport over by Haynes Point, where it kind of [[08:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29976.440000000002s)]
*  the river comes together near Haynes Point in the airport. That will be one of the focuses of the [[08:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29984.52s)]
*  investigation as Army investigators help the National Transportation Safety Board look into [[08:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29993.08s)]
*  this. Can you please help us understand the significance of that point, the maximum ceiling [[08:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=29998.12s)]
*  over the river being 200 feet and why they'll be honing in on that? Yeah, because there is a lot of [[08:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30002.600000000002s)]
*  traffic in the D.C. airspace. We've heard throughout the morning about how often it is we see military [[08:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30009.56s)]
*  helicopters. It's not unusual to see military helicopters on the Potomac River. We see them [[08:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30016.04s)]
*  taking senior DOD officials back and forth. In this case, it was a training flight and we've [[08:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30021.56s)]
*  heard from the Secretary of Defense Pete Hegsett that they were training for a contingency emergency [[08:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30028.920000000002s)]
*  operation. And we've looked into that and that could mean they were training for an event where [[08:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30034.2s)]
*  they would have to evacuate senior officials in case there was a tragic event in D.C. Now, [[08:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30040.04s)]
*  the altitude is important because of how congested that airspace is. You have Reagan Airport, [[08:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30046.52s)]
*  one of the most frequented airports in the entire country. And so in that area, [[08:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30052.52s)]
*  the military helicopters, even though there are a lot of military helicopters, are supposed to fly [[08:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30058.280000000002s)]
*  below 200 feet so that planes approaching the airport can approach safely. [[08:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30063.0s)]
*  Do we know anything yet about the soldiers who were on board? [[08:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30070.920000000002s)]
*  CBS News has learned that the crew chief of the helicopter who died is 29-year-old Ryan O'Hara. [[08:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30074.36s)]
*  CBS News has spoken to his family and has confirmed that he tragically passed away in the [[08:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30082.440000000002s)]
*  incident last night. His hometown ROTC posted photos of him. He leaves behind a wife and a [[08:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30090.6s)]
*  one-year-old son. We're still waiting on the identities of the other two service members. [[08:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30097.8s)]
*  The Army is in the process of notifying family members and will not likely make that information [[08:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30103.559999999998s)]
*  public until at least 24 hours after the incident occurred. Anything else you can tell us about [[08:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30109.48s)]
*  concerns in this particular flying corridor that had been brought up prior to this collision? [[08:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30115.8s)]
*  Well, looking at it today, there have been concerns of near misses in the past. There were [[08:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30121.16s)]
*  two near misses in 2024 that several members of Congress spoke about on the Senate floor and in [[08:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30128.44s)]
*  hearings. And there's been concerns about the number of flights into Reagan on a daily basis. [[08:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30138.359999999997s)]
*  And then anecdotally, we hear from people in D.C. about the level of military helicopter traffic. [[08:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30146.36s)]
*  That, as far as I know, was not part of the near misses last year, but is something that will be [[08:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30155.0s)]
*  considered going forward. And actually, I should note that President Trump's pick to be secretary [[08:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30160.44s)]
*  of the Army had his confirmation hearing this morning. And he said that going forward, they'll [[08:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30165.64s)]
*  certainly be looking at whether or not training flights like the one last night should be as close [[08:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30171.079999999998s)]
*  as they are to Reagan Airport. We heard NTSB chair Jennifer Hamandis say that this is going [[08:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30176.12s)]
*  to be a whole of government response. What role do you believe the Pentagon will play in that? [[08:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30181.879999999997s)]
*  So the Army equivalent of the National Transportation Safety Board is down in Fort [[08:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30188.44s)]
*  Novosel, Alabama. They have sent a team of investigators up to D.C. to support NTSB in [[08:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30194.92s)]
*  their investigation. Because this involved a civilian passenger plane, NTSB will be in the lead [[08:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30201.96s)]
*  and the Army will be supporting. So Army investigators from the Army Combat Safety Center [[08:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30208.36s)]
*  down in Alabama are deployed to D.C. to help NTSB. And Secretary of Defense Pete Hex has said that [[08:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30214.44s)]
*  Army Criminal Investigative Division, Army CID, is also helping with NTSB. But NTSB remains the lead. [[08:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30221.239999999998s)]
*  What questions are you asking, Ellie? Well, the height of the helicopter remains a concern. When [[08:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30229.719999999998s)]
*  we ask people about at what point was it in the sky when the collision happened, the answer is [[08:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30239.239999999998s)]
*  always we have to wait for the investigation to carry itself out. So the investigation, [[08:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30249.559999999998s)]
*  we will be waiting. The NTSB said that it will take 30 days. I want to know from the Army whether [[08:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30255.64s)]
*  their piece of it will take that long. And then I also want to know more about the two service [[08:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30262.04s)]
*  members, the two other service members who lost their lives. Ellie Watson, thank you. [[08:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30267.32s)]
*  Joining me now is Linda Tran. She served as Director of Public Engagement and a Senior [[08:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30274.84s)]
*  Advisor to former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg. Linda, first of all, what are your [[08:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30278.920000000002s)]
*  initial reactions and assessments based on what we know? Well, first of all, there's a lot coming [[08:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30284.12s)]
*  at us at all moments. And I think the most important thing is for us to continue to be patient. [[08:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30289.559999999998s)]
*  Anytime there is a tragedy like what we've seen and recognizing it has been quite some years since [[08:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30295.079999999998s)]
*  we've seen a commercial airline crash with this level of fatalities involved, we need to let the [[08:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30300.52s)]
*  NTSB, the FAA, DOT, and other federal officials do the fact finding that they need to get done, [[08:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30305.8s)]
*  that we heard Chair Homendy talk about earlier today. They need to make sure they're not jumping [[08:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30311.56s)]
*  to any sort of conclusions and that they take a look at the digital trail that was left, that they [[08:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30315.8s)]
*  have access to the various communiques and understand exactly what happened, importantly, [[08:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30320.52s)]
*  so that they can make recommendations to ensure that this kind of a tragedy doesn't happen in [[08:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30324.92s)]
*  the future. We do have new CBS reporting that I would like to bring to you that the jobs [[08:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30329.16s)]
*  in air traffic control are usually two jobs monitoring helicopters and planes. The supervisor [[08:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30335.96s)]
*  combined them early, hence why we are seeing not normal staffing language. What does that [[08:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30343.239999999998s)]
*  tell you here? What questions do you have about that? We know this is preliminary. We know that [[08:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30349.719999999998s)]
*  this is still an active recovery mission. But what does that detail tell you about what really needs [[08:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30353.8s)]
*  to be honed in on here? Well, look, I think it's pretty clear that we need to make sure that we [[08:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30359.399999999998s)]
*  have a very robust air traffic control workforce. And we also need to make sure that the people that [[08:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30364.52s)]
*  are in those towers, which are so critical to the safety of the flying public, that those people have [[08:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30370.04s)]
*  the training that they need. And people who are watching may not understand the actual credentialing [[08:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30374.84s)]
*  process takes somewhere around two years from start to finish for someone to be able to be in [[08:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30380.84s)]
*  that tower in the first place. And then typically what happens is you have an ATC supervisor who has [[08:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30385.72s)]
*  10 or more years of on the job experience so that that new person gets on the job training under [[08:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30391.8s)]
*  somebody who has had a lot of experience taking in all of the information that you have described [[08:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30397.8s)]
*  to the viewers here and to make sure that they are paying attention to all air traffic and making [[08:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30403.48s)]
*  sure that everybody has a clear path forward. Now, I'm not aware of this report that you mentioned [[08:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30408.52s)]
*  that indicates that there were some combined jobs. But if that is true, then that is something that [[08:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30413.719999999998s)]
*  I would expect the FAA and DOT to look into very, very seriously. This was first reported by the New [[08:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30418.28s)]
*  York Times and confirmed by CBS News. Former Secretary Buttigieg wrote on X that under his tenure, [[08:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30423.16s)]
*  they drove down close calls and grew air traffic control. I'm sure that you heard what President [[08:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30431.079999999998s)]
*  Trump said earlier today in the briefing room, bringing up conjecture that perhaps diversity, [[08:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30435.8s)]
*  equity and inclusion policies somehow drove down standards as it relates to FAA employees. [[08:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30442.52s)]
*  Are you in disagreement with President Trump and his comments? Do you believe that any standards [[08:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30448.52s)]
*  were lowered under President Biden's administration? I mean, absolutely not. I mean, very clearly, [[08:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30453.24s)]
*  you know, what you saw Secretary P. [[08:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30459.56s)]
*  Trump. [[08:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30462.04s)]
*  Okay. It looks like we perhaps lost Linda Tran, but we do appreciate her time in speaking with us. [[08:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30470.280000000002s)]
*  Now, lawmakers of both sides of the aisle are expressing their condolences and they're also [[08:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30476.2s)]
*  asking how this could have happened. So let's head on over to Capitol Hill with CBS News [[08:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30480.280000000002s)]
*  congressional correspondent, Nicole Killian. Nicole, you had a rather enlightening interview [[08:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30483.8s)]
*  with Senator Tammy Duckworth about the crash. What did she say? [[08:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30488.84s)]
*  Well, she is still gathering information just like everyone else is. She was briefed by [[08:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30493.24s)]
*  federal officials not too long ago and so she is hoping to glean more information. So she is kind [[08:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30500.28s)]
*  of refraining from commenting on what might have happened. However, she did tell us from her own [[08:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30507.8s)]
*  personal experience. Of course, she was a combat pilot for many years. In fact, she was involved [[08:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30515.08s)]
*  in an accident when her own Black Hawk helicopter went down along with her crew. That is ultimately [[08:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30521.480000000003s)]
*  how she lost her legs and her limbs. But obviously she is still here today as a survivor from that [[08:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30527.0s)]
*  accident. And so I talked more personally to her about that experience, but also what comes to mind [[08:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30535.08s)]
*  when she sees an accident like what we all witnessed last night. Take a listen. [[08:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30541.8s)]
*  You know very intimately what it's like to be in a Black Hawk. You also know what it's like [[08:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30547.16s)]
*  to be in a Black Hawk when it goes down. What goes through your mind in a moment like that? [[08:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30553.64s)]
*  Well, you know, our soldiers are the best trained in the world and they would have been doing their [[08:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30560.68s)]
*  jobs and everything that they could until their very last moment to do their jobs and stick with [[08:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30565.079999999998s)]
*  the training that they've received. I have every confidence in that helicopter crew that they are [[08:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30570.84s)]
*  well trained. They wouldn't be out there in this special airspace. The airspace around Washington, [[08:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30575.4s)]
*  D.C., especially this inner ring is called the SFRA, the Special Flight Restricted Area. You [[08:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30580.36s)]
*  don't get to fly in that without additional flight training. So we know that this is a trained crew [[08:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30584.68s)]
*  that was in there. We just have to hold, you know, just be patient. Let the accident investigators [[08:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30589.72s)]
*  do their job and we'll figure out what happened. Now from the briefing that she had with officials [[08:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30594.28s)]
*  earlier today, she said she was made aware that there was some communication between air traffic [[08:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30599.56s)]
*  controllers and the Black Hawk helicopter and that it appeared that they did receive that communication [[08:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30605.800000000003s)]
*  from air traffic control. But again, kind of what happened beyond that, she still certainly has [[08:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30613.32s)]
*  questions and has asked for a transcript of some of that air traffic control traffic. She has also [[08:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30618.760000000002s)]
*  said that she doesn't believe that this crew had any type of night vision goggles or were using [[08:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30628.120000000003s)]
*  night vision goggles at the time of this. But she also said it's not necessarily required and also [[08:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30633.16s)]
*  just talked about being in a populated area like D.C. because there are a lot of lights. It's [[08:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30639.0s)]
*  something that you may or may not need. But she believes that certainly the crew executed in the [[08:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30643.4s)]
*  best way possible based on the training and experience that they had. But obviously, like [[08:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30650.36s)]
*  all of us, is still waiting to get more answers as this investigation continues. [[08:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30655.32s)]
*  Nicole, I have less than a minute with you, but confirmation hearings for [[08:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30660.52s)]
*  President Trump's nominees were today. Did this come up? [[08:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30663.32s)]
*  It did. You know, she was part of a hearing before the Senate Armed Services [[08:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30667.4s)]
*  Committee where they were holding a confirmation hearing for the nominee for secretary of the [[08:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30671.56s)]
*  Army, Daniel Driscoll. So it did come up in that the committee did take a moment of silence [[08:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30677.96s)]
*  during that hearing to pause to remember the victims. But there were some questions [[08:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30683.4s)]
*  asked about safety and training protocol going forward. We have heard from other members of [[08:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30688.52s)]
*  Congress on this issue as well. Certainly everybody, their thoughts and prayers are [[08:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30694.280000000002s)]
*  with the families, but certainly a lot of concerns about aviation safety and what role [[08:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30698.68s)]
*  Congress may play going forward. Nicole Killian, thank you. [[08:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30702.52s)]
*  Coming up throughout the afternoon, we'll have live coverage of the latest developments following [[08:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30706.920000000002s)]
*  last night's fatal midair collision at Reagan National Airport. We'll update the investigation [[08:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30710.44s)]
*  and reaction to the president's comments on what he thinks may have contributed to the tragedy. [[08:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30715.48s)]
*  Also, what the NTSB is saying as they embark on their investigation into the collision. [[08:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30720.12s)]
*  Stay with us. You're watching CBS News 24 seven. [[08:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30724.84s)]
*  Okay. [[08:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30740.44s)]
*  Politics isn't a game. The data says you do have a women problem. Politics is about policy. Isn't [[08:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30751.64s)]
*  that giving people false hope? I'm a voracious consumer of information and I'm impatient. I [[08:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30757.16s)]
*  don't like to be spun to be moderate or face the nation is not an anchor. It's not an actress. [[08:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30762.12s)]
*  You are up here to moderate a conversation. That means bringing the most powerful [[08:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30769.0s)]
*  stakeholders to the table to become better informed. [[08:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30773.16s)]
*  The justices ruled that Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated the constitution. [[08:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30781.8s)]
*  In the aftermath of the Supreme Court decision to end affirmative action and college admissions, [[08:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30787.0s)]
*  uncertainty sets in for some students of color. Action really gave us an equal opportunity. [[08:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30791.48s)]
*  CBS reports explores the historic decision and what it means for those chasing an opportunity [[08:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=30796.600000000002s)]

*  thorough investigation of this entire tragedy looking at the facts. Skyler Henry was at the [[08:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31050.52s)]

*  how they will go about their process because they told us they were frank. Today is the first full [[08:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31062.52s)]
*  day for them on the scene and they can't be divulging any facts about the case yet. [[08:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31067.96s)]
*  Yeah and that also includes getting in front of any sort of speculation that we have seen not only [[08:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31075.0s)]
*  on social media but also from members of the Trump administration and so they say that they will be [[08:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31079.559999999998s)]
*  taking their time as you pointed out this is their first full day assessing exactly what happened. [[08:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31085.160000000003s)]
*  Interesting to note that they say that they have yet to recover any of the so-called black boxes on [[08:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31091.56s)]
*  either of the aircraft the commercial regional jet or that Black Hawk helicopter. They also say that [[08:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31096.68s)]
*  they have yet to get to the flight data recorder which is underwater and that is the other component [[08:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31102.920000000002s)]
*  to this that is so unusual Lindsay just the fact that this was a water emergency and that crews are [[08:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31109.0s)]
*  not only dealing with trying to obviously recover as many of those bodies as as possible but also [[08:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31115.0s)]
*  really try to get to the bottom of exactly what happened here knowing that the conditions are [[08:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31121.88s)]
*  treacherous and the initial parts of this effort and these efforts were all happening under the [[08:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31126.92s)]
*  cloak of darkness in those cold chilly waters of the Potomac River. They also talked about what [[08:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31132.76s)]
*  methods that they will be taking moving forward in terms of this meticulous process to try to [[08:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31137.72s)]
*  reconstruct exactly what happened and if there was any sort of fault at all they say that they [[08:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31141.72s)]
*  will be looking through a series of groups working groups they say that there will be a [[08:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31146.52s)]
*  structure group a systems group a helicopter group given the fact that a military helicopter [[08:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31150.440000000002s)]
*  was involved but also a human performance group as well and that's interesting because I asked one of [[08:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31155.32s)]
*  the board members Lindsay about that earlier today earlier today defense secretary Pete Hegseth [[08:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31160.440000000002s)]
*  referenced that mistakes were made last night and so I asked whether that meant human error or if [[08:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31165.96s)]
*  there were some sort of mechanical failure but of course as I pointed out before they did not want [[08:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31171.64s)]
*  to get in front of any sort of preliminary findings they did say that we should see something [[08:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31175.399999999998s)]
*  happen here within the next 30 days as far as their initial findings and reports but a part of that [[08:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31180.76s)]
*  human performance group they say that they will take into consideration what were what was going [[08:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31186.6s)]
*  on with the pilots of both the commercial regional aircraft as well as the military [[08:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31191.32s)]
*  aircraft as well we also heard that there were apparently recording devices on the military [[08:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31196.84s)]
*  helicopter that could lend a hand in terms of getting to the bottom of this investigation and [[08:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31203.56s)]
*  there are also reports out there as well speculating about what was happening inside of air traffic [[08:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31208.36s)]
*  control and whether that was properly staffed or if there were other people that were needed given [[08:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31213.96s)]
*  the types of aircraft and the amount of operations going on here at the airport during the time of [[08:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31218.92s)]
*  the collision and so they say that they do not want to get in front of any of that at this point [[08:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31225.16s)]
*  but they say that they will continue to update us as quickly and as thoroughly as they can [[08:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31229.64s)]
*  and they also point out that everyone as far as next of kin has yet to be notified they are still [[08:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31235.879999999997s)]
*  working to try to brief families some of whom are still making their way to Washington DC [[08:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31242.519999999997s)]
*  in order to get briefed as to what exactly happened here they did say that they in some [[08:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31248.84s)]
*  cases make arrangements so that family members can make their way to the collision site in this [[08:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31253.32s)]
*  case what would be the banks of the Potomac River but they say that there are still people still [[08:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31257.72s)]
*  trying to make their way here to Washington DC they've yet to contact everyone as it relates to [[08:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31262.280000000002s)]
*  next of kin of those who may have been on board as well we should also point out given the fact of [[08:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31267.72s)]
*  who at least we have come to identify as far as passengers on board those aircraft we know that [[08:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31272.76s)]
*  there was a figure skating component some of the top figure skaters out there from both the US [[08:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31279.16s)]
*  and from Russia President Trump alluded to that earlier today during that press briefing and also [[08:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31284.6s)]
*  talked about how he and the United States would be responsible for getting those remains back to [[08:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31290.039999999997s)]
*  Russia he also said that there were some other passengers on board those aircraft that were from [[08:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31296.039999999997s)]
*  other countries we're yet to see exactly where they are from as well but it just goes to show [[08:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31301.640000000003s)]
*  just how much work is left to do as crews and all of these administration and organizations work to [[08:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31305.960000000003s)]
*  really try to get to the bottom of what happened Skyler they said that right now they are still [[08:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31313.56s)]
*  in active recovery mode but you had mentioned the flight data recorders of black boxes on the [[08:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31318.760000000002s)]
*  helicopter those still have yet to be recovered but also other kinds of evidence including [[08:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31323.24s)]
*  debris and even cell phones what did they say about that [[08:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31328.92s)]
*  yeah they said that they were going to be sensitive as it relates to passengers cell phones [[08:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31334.359999999997s)]
*  and also their personal belongings and how that could help with this investigation and sort of [[08:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31340.519999999997s)]
*  putting the pieces together but they also said that what they noticed as it relates to the fuselage [[08:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31346.12s)]
*  of the commercial regional jet was that it was broken into three pieces that's something that [[08:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31353.879999999997s)]
*  we heard from officials within the Trump administration earlier today as well as other [[08:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31358.28s)]
*  officials who made that initial press conference here at the airport and so they say that both the [[08:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31365.16s)]
*  aircraft the American Airlines aircraft as well as the military aircraft were flips upside down [[08:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31370.44s)]
*  they also talked about the challenges given the space in this investigation because of [[08:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31377.879999999997s)]
*  that Potomac River that I talked about not only is the river rushing at this current moment but [[08:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31383.24s)]
*  it is still cold it did snow here recently in Washington DC and so crews are working around [[08:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31389.0s)]
*  the clock to not only gather as you pointed out and try to recover as many bodies as possible but [[08:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31394.36s)]
*  as much evidence as possible as they look to reconstruct exactly what happened here [[08:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31399.16s)]
*  Skyler they were asked about whether there was any indication of whether anybody made it off of the [[08:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31403.32s)]
*  plane what was the response yeah well they said and echoed the same sentiments as the DC fire chief [[08:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31409.56s)]
*  earlier today just given the conditions at this point they haven't been able to determine whether [[08:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31421.08s)]
*  anyone was able to make it off of the aircraft they say it was a almost an instant collision and the [[08:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31427.72s)]
*  fact that it happened the way it did it was almost improbable so to speak to to imagine that anyone [[08:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31432.92s)]
*  could have survived the impact of this crash and that's something really that takes your breath [[08:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31440.76s)]
*  away Lindsay when you think about it given the fact that that American Airlines flight was so [[08:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31444.359999999997s)]
*  close to landing here at the airport minutes away even and the fact that at least from earlier [[08:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31448.679999999997s)]
*  reports every indication has said that we're talking about hundreds of feet as it relates to altitude [[08:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31455.32s)]
*  and so because of that they say that given the circumstances given the impact and how quickly [[08:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31463.16s)]
*  everything happened it was pretty difficult to imagine that anyone could have survived [[08:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31468.92s)]
*  what happened here last night such a tragedy Skyler Henry thank you for your reporting [[08:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31473.079999999998s)]

*  trump's statements which seemed to connect the incident with diversity equity and inclusion [[08:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31979.16s)]
*  programs in federal agencies he seemed to suggest that standards were lowered under the obama and [[08:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31983.24s)]
*  biden administrations what did the ntsb have to say about that [[08:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31988.44s)]
*  yes the ntsb was asked about that and their response was it is standard within the organization [[08:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=31994.92s)]
*  to investigate the human the machine and the environment so they are going to look into the [[08:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32000.199999999997s)]
*  humans involved those who were involved in air traffic control those pilots but they did not [[08:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32005.239999999998s)]
*  specifically attribute any of the cause the failure regarding this collision to be because of diversity [[08:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32010.68s)]
*  equity and inclusion initiatives they're saying it is part of their investigation to make sure [[08:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32017.0s)]
*  that they look into the human the machine and the environment but of course as you mentioned [[08:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32021.88s)]
*  president trump and members of his administration reiterating that dei hiring practices particularly [[08:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32025.8s)]
*  those that were enforced and enacted under previous administrations may have played a role [[08:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32031.72s)]
*  in the quality of some of the staff regarding this midair collision we're learning more about [[08:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32037.24s)]
*  air traffic control staffing at the time of the crash what can you tell us [[08:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32042.84s)]
*  well cbs news has learned that there was one air traffic control worker who was managing [[08:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32049.56s)]
*  helicopters and planes and that is essentially a role that is divided into two parts two workers [[08:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32056.12s)]
*  but there was one worker that was managing both and so ntsb officials were asked about that today [[08:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32062.76s)]
*  they said that they did not review any specifics regarding a particular air traffic control [[08:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32067.88s)]
*  employee but that is something that they are certainly going to investigate the cbs news [[08:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32073.960000000003s)]
*  has learned this and did ask about potentially under staffing or things that could have been [[08:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32077.56s)]
*  better handled in terms of the number of air traffic controllers who are monitoring both [[08:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32083.08s)]
*  helicopters and planes but again ntsb said that they could not speculate on that again this is [[08:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32087.24s)]
*  part of the very preliminary portion of this investigation and right now it is simply looking [[08:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32091.48s)]
*  at all of the aspects involved coordinating with all of the agencies but they will be looking into [[08:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32097.800000000003s)]
*  hiring and will be looking into who was managing the helicopters and the planes [[08:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32102.52s)]
*  right before that midair collision erica brown thank you [[08:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32106.920000000002s)]
*  a short time ago president trump spoke about the crash in his first appearance in the white house [[08:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32112.120000000003s)]
*  briefing room since being sworn in for a second term without evidence he shifted blame to his [[08:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32116.2s)]
*  two democratic predecessors as well as diversity equity and inclusion initiatives you must have [[08:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32120.68s)]
*  only the highest standards for those who work in our aviation system i changed the obama standards [[08:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32126.04s)]
*  from very mediocre at best to extraordinary and then when i left office and biden took over he [[08:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32133.0s)]
*  changed them back to lower than ever before for more let's bring in cbs news chief white house [[08:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32139.88s)]
*  correspondent nancy cordez nancy the president slammed the obama and my administrations he [[08:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32147.08s)]
*  seemed to insinuate they loosened standards for air traffic controllers and faa employees [[08:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32151.64s)]
*  in the name of dei he also slammed slammed former transportation secretary pete buddige [[08:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32156.6s)]
*  what did he say and is there currently any evidence to support that standards have gone [[08:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32162.68s)]
*  down and may have contributed to this there isn't any indication lindsey that the standards have [[08:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32166.04s)]
*  changed markedly in fact sources have told me that the standards for air traffic controllers have [[08:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32172.52s)]
*  always been quite high and that they need to go through rigorous mental and physical testing [[08:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32178.68s)]
*  to to get the job in the first place and so we're still looking into what the president might have [[08:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32185.0s)]
*  been referring to when he talked about those changes in standards but more broadly what i [[08:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32191.56s)]
*  think stood out to a lot of reporters in the room was that on one hand the president was saying [[08:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32196.84s)]
*  that he still doesn't know what led to this particular crash and then at the same time [[08:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32201.96s)]
*  saying that dei was somehow to blame what we know so far and i know you've been discussing it on the [[08:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32207.24s)]
*  show is that according to the military the black hawk pilots were actually quite experienced and [[08:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32213.480000000003s)]
*  american airlines says that the pilots involved in the crash were experienced as well one had six [[08:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32220.760000000002s)]
*  years with the airline the other had nearly two years with the airline we don't know much about [[08:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32227.640000000003s)]
*  the air traffic controllers involved but i can tell you that because reagan national has such a [[08:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32233.16s)]
*  complicated approach as you know we've been discussing over the past 12 hours or so the the [[08:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32239.8s)]
*  air traffic controllers who are chosen for reagan national tend to be quite experienced as well so [[08:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32247.0s)]

*  was happening inside of air traffic control and whether that was properly staffed or if there were [[09:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32970.35999999999s)]

*  want to get in front of any of that at this point but they say that they will continue to update [[09:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=32985.399999999994s)]

*  way to the collision site in this case what will be the banks of the potomac river but they say [[09:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33014.44s)]
*  that there are still people still trying to make their way here to washington dc they've yet to [[09:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33019.32s)]
*  contact everyone as it relates to next of kin of those who may have been on board as well [[09:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33024.12s)]
*  should also point out given the fact of who at least we have come to identify as far as passengers [[09:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33028.920000000006s)]
*  on board those aircraft we know that there was a figure skating component some of the top figure [[09:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33034.76s)]
*  skaters out there from both the u.s and from russia president trump alluded to that earlier [[09:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33040.76s)]
*  today during that press briefing and also talked about how he and the united states would be [[09:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33046.12s)]
*  responsible for getting those remains back to russia he also said that there were some other [[09:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33052.200000000004s)]
*  passengers on board those aircraft that were from from other countries we're yet to see exactly [[09:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33056.6s)]
*  where they are from as well but it just goes to show just how much work is left to do as crews and [[09:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33062.12s)]
*  all of these administration and organizations work to really try to get to the bottom of what happened [[09:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33069.0s)]
*  skyler they said that right now they are still in active recovery mode but you had mentioned the [[09:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33074.520000000004s)]
*  flight data recorders of black boxes on the helicopter those still have yet to be recovered [[09:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33079.560000000005s)]
*  but also other kinds of evidence including debris and even cell phones what did they say about that [[09:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33084.280000000006s)]
*  yeah they said that they were going to be sensitive as it relates to passengers cell phones and also [[09:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33092.68s)]
*  their personal belongings and how that could help with this investigation and sort of putting the [[09:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33099.4s)]
*  pieces together but they also said that what they noticed as it relates to the fuselage of the [[09:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33104.920000000006s)]
*  commercial regional jet was that it was broken into three pieces that's something that we heard [[09:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33112.44s)]
*  from officials within the trump administration earlier today as well as other officials who made [[09:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33117.72s)]
*  that initial press conference here at the airport and so they say that both the aircraft the american [[09:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33124.200000000004s)]
*  airlines aircraft as well as the military aircraft were flips upside down they also talked about the [[09:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33130.600000000006s)]
*  challenges given the space in this investigation because of that potomac river that i talked about [[09:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33137.4s)]
*  not only is the river rushing at this current moment but it is still cold it did [[09:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33144.04s)]
*  snow here recently in washington dc and so crews are working around the clock to not only gather [[09:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33148.92s)]
*  as you pointed out and try to recover as many bodies as possible but as much evidence as possible [[09:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33153.8s)]
*  as they look to reconstruct exactly what happened here skyler they were asked about whether there [[09:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33158.76s)]
*  was any indication of whether anybody made it off of the plane what was the response yeah [[09:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33164.52s)]
*  well they said and echoed the same sentiments as the dc fire chief earlier today just given the [[09:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33171.56s)]
*  conditions at this point they haven't been able to determine whether anyone was able to make it [[09:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33179.64s)]
*  off of the aircraft they say it was almost an instant collision and the fact that it happened [[09:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33186.04s)]
*  the way it did it was almost improbable so to speak to to imagine that anyone could have survived [[09:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33191.16s)]
*  that crash and that's something really that takes your breath away lindsay when you think about it [[09:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33198.68s)]
*  given the fact that that american airlines flight was so close to landing here at the airport minutes [[09:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33203.880000000005s)]
*  away even and the fact that at least from earlier reports every indication has said that we're [[09:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33210.200000000004s)]
*  talking about hundreds of feet as it relates to altitude and so because of that they say that [[09:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33217.72s)]
*  given the circumstances given the impact and how quickly everything happened it was [[09:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33224.28s)]
*  pretty difficult to imagine that anyone could have survived what happened here last night [[09:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33228.6s)]
*  such a tragedy skyler henry thank you for your reporting let's go now to tom hansen who is at [[09:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33233.08s)]

*  trump's statements which seemed to connect the incident with diversity equity and inclusion [[09:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33781.799999999996s)]
*  programs in federal agencies he seemed to suggest that standards were lowered under the obama and [[09:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33785.880000000005s)]

*  yes the ntsb was asked about that and their response was it is standard within the organization [[09:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33797.560000000005s)]
*  to investigate the human the machine and the environment so they are going to look into the [[09:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33802.840000000004s)]
*  humans involved those who were involved in air traffic control those pilots but they did not [[09:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33807.880000000005s)]
*  specifically attribute any of the cause the failure regarding this collision to be because [[09:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33813.32s)]
*  of diversity equity and inclusion initiatives they're saying it is part of their investigation [[09:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33819.0s)]
*  to make sure that they look into the human the machine and the environment but of course as you [[09:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33823.56s)]
*  mentioned president trump and members of his administration reiterating that dei hiring [[09:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33828.12s)]
*  practices particularly those that were enforced and enacted under previous administrations may [[09:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33833.08s)]
*  have played a role in the quality of some of the staff regarding this midair collision [[09:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33838.52s)]
*  we're learning more about air traffic control staffing at the time of the crash what can you [[09:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33844.439999999995s)]
*  tell us well cbs news has learned that there was one air traffic control worker who was managing [[09:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33848.439999999995s)]
*  helicopters and planes and that is essentially a role that is divided into two parts two workers [[09:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33858.759999999995s)]
*  but there was one worker that was managing both and so ntsb officials were asked about that today [[09:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33865.4s)]
*  they said that they did not review any specifics regarding a particular air traffic control [[09:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33870.6s)]
*  employee but that is something that they are certainly going to investigate the cbs news [[09:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33876.6s)]
*  has learned this and did ask about potentially under staffing or things that could have been [[09:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33880.200000000004s)]
*  better handled in terms of the number of air traffic controllers who are monitoring both [[09:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33885.72s)]
*  helicopters and planes but again ntsb said that they could not speculate on that again this is [[09:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33889.880000000005s)]
*  part of the very preliminary portion of this investigation and right now it is simply looking [[09:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33894.12s)]
*  at all of the aspects involved coordinating with all of the agencies but they will be looking into [[09:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33900.280000000006s)]
*  hiring and will be looking into who was managing the helicopters and the planes [[09:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33905.16s)]
*  right before that midair collision erica brown thank you [[09:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33909.560000000005s)]

*  us at all moments and i think the most important thing is for us to continue to be patient anytime [[09:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33931.48s)]
*  there is a tragedy like what we've seen and recognizing it has been quite some years since [[09:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33937.24s)]
*  we've seen a commercial airline crash with this level of fatalities involved we need to let the [[09:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33942.2s)]
*  ntsb the faa dot and other federal officials do the fact finding that they need to get done [[09:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33947.560000000005s)]
*  that we heard chair homidy talk about earlier today they need to make sure they're not jumping [[09:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33953.240000000005s)]
*  to any sort of conclusions and that they take a look at the digital trail that was left that [[09:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33957.48s)]
*  they have access to the various communicates and understand exactly what happened importantly so [[09:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33962.04s)]
*  that they can make recommendations to ensure that this kind of a tragedy doesn't happen in the future [[09:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33966.840000000004s)]
*  we do have new cbs reporting uh that i would like to bring to you that the jobs in air traffic [[09:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33971.88s)]
*  control are usually two jobs monitoring helicopters and planes the supervisor combined them early [[09:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33978.68s)]
*  hence why we are seeing not normal staffing language what does that tell you here what [[09:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33988.2s)]
*  questions do you have about that we know this is preliminary we know that this is still an [[09:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33992.36s)]
*  active recovery mission but what does that detail tell you about what really needs to be honed in [[09:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=33996.2s)]
*  on here well look i think it's pretty clear that we need to make sure that we have a very robust [[09:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34001.719999999994s)]
*  air traffic control workforce and we also need to make sure that the people that are in those [[09:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34007.56s)]
*  towers which are so critical to the safety of the flying public that those people have the training [[09:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34012.439999999995s)]
*  that they need and people who are watching may not understand the actual credentialing process takes [[09:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34017.159999999996s)]
*  somewhere around two years from start to finish for someone to be able to be in that tower in the [[09:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34023.32s)]
*  first place and then typically what happens is you have an atc supervisor who has 10 or more years [[09:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34028.12s)]
*  of on-the-job experience so that that new person gets on-the-job training under somebody who has [[09:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34034.68s)]
*  had a lot of experience taking in all of the information that you have described to the [[09:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34040.2s)]
*  viewers here and to make sure that they are paying attention to all air traffic and making sure that [[09:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34045.72s)]
*  everybody has a clear path forward linda tram but we do appreciate her time in speaking with us and [[09:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34050.6s)]
*  so let's head on over to capitol hill with cbs news congressional correspondent nicole killian [[09:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34056.68s)]
*  nicole you had a rather enlightening interview with senator tammy duckworth about the crash what did [[09:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34061.08s)]
*  she say well she is still gathering information just like everyone else's she was briefed by [[09:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34066.28s)]
*  federal officials not too long ago and so she is hoping to glean more information so she is kind [[09:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34075.4s)]
*  of refraining from commenting on what might have happened however she did tell us from her own [[09:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34082.840000000004s)]
*  personal experience of course she was a combat pilot for many years in fact she was involved in [[09:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34090.2s)]
*  an accident when her own blackhawk helicopter went down along with her crew that is ultimately how she [[09:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34096.68s)]
*  lost her legs and her limbs but obviously she is still here today as a survivor from that accident [[09:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34103.0s)]
*  and so i talk more personally to her about that experience but also what comes to mind when she [[09:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34110.6s)]
*  sees an accident like what we all witnessed last night take a listen you know very intimately what [[09:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34117.64s)]
*  it's like to be in a blackhawk you also know what it's like to be in a blackhawk when it goes down [[09:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34124.68s)]
*  what goes through your mind in a moment like that well you know our soldiers are the best [[09:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34131.64s)]
*  trained in the world and they would have been doing their jobs and everything that they could [[09:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34138.2s)]
*  until their very last moment to do their jobs and and stick with the training that they've received [[09:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34142.04s)]
*  i have every confidence in that helicopter crew that they are well trained they wouldn't be out [[09:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34147.64s)]
*  there in this special airspace the airspace around washington dc especially this inner ring is called [[09:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34152.04s)]
*  the sfra the special flight restricted area you don't get to fly in that without additional [[09:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34157.56s)]
*  flight training so we know that this is a trained crew that was in there we just have to hold you [[09:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34162.2s)]
*  know just be patient let the accident investigators do their job and we'll figure out what happened [[09:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34167.079999999994s)]
*  now from the briefing that she had with officials earlier today she said she was made aware that [[09:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34172.28s)]
*  there was some communication between air traffic controllers and the blackhawk helicopter and that [[09:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34177.799999999996s)]
*  it appeared that they did receive that communication from air traffic control but again kind of what [[09:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34184.84s)]
*  happened beyond that she still certainly has questions and has asked for a transcript of [[09:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34191.079999999994s)]
*  some of that air traffic control traffic she has also said that she doesn't believe that this crew [[09:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34197.159999999996s)]
*  had any type of night vision goggles or using night vision goggles at the time of this but she [[09:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34205.479999999996s)]
*  also said it's not necessarily required and also just talked about being in a populated area like [[09:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34210.92s)]
*  dc because there are a lot of lights it's something that you may or may not need but she believes that [[09:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34216.36s)]
*  certainly the crew executed in the best way possible based on the training and experience [[09:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34222.68s)]
*  that they had but obviously like all of us is still waiting to get more answers as this [[09:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=34228.439999999995s)]

*  you reported they haven't recovered yet the recorders they haven't recovered the flight data [[09:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35231.64s)]
*  but they need to be very transparent about their work and move just as fast as possible to maintain [[09:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35238.2s)]

*  consoling words for the country he as was put to questions later acknowledged he had no evidence [[09:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35252.12s)]
*  but nevertheless suggested that somehow federal diversity equity and inclusion programs might have [[09:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35259.4s)]
*  been to blame for this your reaction major i actually was watching that news conference and [[09:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35265.16s)]
*  i was absolutely appalled that the president of the united states would make these reckless [[09:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35273.24s)]
*  unsubstantiated claims in the middle of this national tragedy to politicize to politicize this [[09:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35280.520000000004s)]

*  for making these claims and he was in the room with the head of the ntsb that's supposed to be [[09:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35301.159999999996s)]

*  was just appalled that the president would use the moment for political purposes let's talk about [[09:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35313.96s)]
*  reagan national as i understand it it had a theoretical capacity of 15 million flights a year [[09:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35320.52s)]
*  the current capacity is about 20 million flights again as i understand it i may have those numbers [[09:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35327.32s)]
*  wrong feel free to correct me is it running at a higher capacity than you believe is recommended [[09:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35331.4s)]
*  what is your level of concern about what those associated with reagan national have to do to [[09:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35339.4s)]
*  achieve maximum safety so with respect to this particular collision we obviously have to await [[09:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35344.92s)]
*  the facts but i have had an ongoing concern about the congestion at reagan national airport in fact [[09:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35353.0s)]
*  just last year senators cain and warner from virginia and myself opposed the plan to bring [[09:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35362.36s)]
*  more flights into reagan national because it is already the most congested airport in the country [[09:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35370.92s)]
*  right now the amount of time planes have to spend hovering over reagan national before landing [[09:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35379.96s)]
*  is the longest wait time in the country so beyond this particular collision i do have a concern [[09:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35386.84s)]
*  about the safety issues regarding the congestion and that's why we opposed the idea of bringing [[09:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35397.159999999996s)]
*  even more flights and more planes into this very congested airspace very quickly senator do you [[09:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35405.32s)]
*  think that decision to bring more planes in will be now revisited i think that we need to take [[09:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35411.0s)]
*  another look at all these safety issues you know whether or not that's the cause of this particular [[09:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35417.88s)]
*  collision that's up to the ntsp but hopefully this will remind everybody that our number one priority [[09:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35422.68s)]
*  has to be the safety of the flying public and we should look at everything in the context of this [[09:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35429.56s)]

*  what you've seen and i know there are plenty of armchair speculators on social media separate [[09:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35704.759999999995s)]
*  them entirely based on what you've seen what you have heard how would you evaluate what we can [[09:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35711.0s)]
*  glean from the information currently available major thank you you know i came from the ntsb [[09:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35717.4s)]
*  and i'm not going to speculate there's a lot of information out there some is true and some is [[09:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35724.2s)]
*  not i think it's important to just slow down take a breath let the ntsb do their jobs let them [[09:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35728.76s)]
*  collect the information and then disseminate it in a reasonable manner is it unnatural for people [[09:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35735.48s)]

*  this happen is that a natural or unnatural question to ask well it's certainly a national [[09:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35757.72s)]
*  uh a natural question and it's one that we're all asking how could something like this happen [[09:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35764.6s)]
*  and the ntsb will get to the bottom of it and then ultimately they will come out with recommendations [[09:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35770.200000000004s)]
*  to keep something like this from happening again it has been said by others who have done the work [[09:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35776.28s)]
*  that you do robert that there is almost never only one cause of an aviation disaster it is [[09:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35782.28s)]
*  typically a series of events first of all is that true and do you have any sense of what series of [[09:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35790.28s)]
*  events might have been if not to blame implicated well you're right i've investigated over or been [[09:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35795.72s)]
*  involved in the investigation of over 200 uh transportation accidents and i do generally find [[09:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35805.32s)]
*  that there are there are more than there's more than one factor involved in the accident i think [[09:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35811.48s)]
*  there's a couple of things that will be really uh under under the microscope here one will be [[09:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35817.4s)]
*  how did the lateral spacing of the regional jet and the helicopter how did that get so tight [[09:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35824.12s)]
*  that it was just a matter of a feat that they were separated by i'm curious about that i know the ntsb [[09:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35831.48s)]
*  will dig into that what about our reporting and others have reported similarly that in the control [[09:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35838.44s)]
*  tower there was one air traffic controller monitoring the movement of helicopters and [[09:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35845.08s)]
*  civilian aircraft simultaneously a obligation typically undertaken by two in the control tower [[09:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35850.36s)]
*  well major i have not independently verified that but if that's the case i would be very concerned [[09:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35857.8s)]
*  the very first aviation disaster i went to as i was a brand new ntsb board member was in fact an [[09:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35862.6s)]
*  accident where we found that there was only one controller on duty when the faa's guidelines [[09:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35869.56s)]
*  called for two and we feel like that had that control tower been properly staffed that accident [[09:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35874.36s)]
*  may not have occurred and so i'm a member or was a member of an independent safety review team to [[09:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35880.04s)]
*  look at the air traffic control situation we were appointed by the faa administrator a few years ago [[09:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35886.84s)]
*  and we we definitely confirmed that there is a controller shortage and that needs to be resolved [[09:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35893.079999999994s)]
*  it's not going to be resolved overnight the faa is working on it but we've got to keep working on that [[09:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35897.96s)]
*  and robert is there a congestion problem at washington reagan national airport and should [[09:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=35904.35999999999s)]

*  history of what he was talking about and how long that particular language had actually been on the [[10:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=36723.479999999996s)]
*  faa website sure he started arguing major that under the biden administration the faa had sent [[10:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=36728.84s)]
*  out a directive ordering faa officials to hire people with severe disabilities and he started [[10:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=36738.35999999999s)]
*  listing out the various nature that these severe disabilities could take someone who was [[10:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=36745.56s)]

*  it turns out as reporters who were also doing the same thing i was actually pointed out to the [[10:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=36762.759999999995s)]

*  2013 so it also encompassed the trump administration the first trump administration and in fact it [[10:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=36775.64s)]
*  it went beyond the faa to other government agencies as well talking about the goal of hiring [[10:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=36783.16s)]
*  people with severe disabilities not necessarily for positions like air traffic controller [[10:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=36789.560000000005s)]
*  but for lower level positions so it doesn't appear that what he was talking about had anything to do [[10:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=36795.0s)]
*  with the biden administration specifically which he was blaming and also didn't have anything to do [[10:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=36802.520000000004s)]
*  with the crash because it did not apply to the air traffic controllers who were in the tower and it [[10:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=36808.12s)]
*  certainly didn't apply to the pilots who were flying either the regional jet or the blackhawk [[10:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=36813.88s)]
*  helicopter and nancy it also creates the implication that whomever was hired by the faa as an air [[10:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=36820.2s)]
*  traffic controller would not have to go through the same rigorous training procedure to become an air [[10:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=36825.56s)]

*  during biden and obama's administrations and they simply can't point to any evidence that the [[10:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=36849.72s)]
*  standards have meaningfully changed in fact what they told me is that the the standards for air [[10:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=36855.8s)]
*  traffic controllers have actually always been quite high and the training program quite onerous [[10:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=36859.88s)]

*  be independent and really tried to push back against characterizations of her as being for [[10:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37014.52s)]

*  was how patelle tried to walk this fine line between trying to establish some independence [[10:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37299.08s)]

*  republicans are in a tight spot they need to you know make sure that they confirmed these people [[10:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37383.799999999996s)]

*  louder about a week and a half ago about her qualifications and you know her relationship [[10:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37395.159999999996s)]

*  out the most obviously this is a thing where politics and governing um kind of like clashes [[10:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37407.159999999996s)]
*  right and we have to understand or you know they're griping grappling with whether or not [[10:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37414.84s)]

*  they accomplished that but they're under a very strict deadline sometime next week they need to [[10:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37464.36s)]

*  is kind of emblematic of some of the tougher confirmation pushes from president trump in that [[10:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37505.56s)]
*  the nominees have to essentially reject or throw out some of their previous statements and say well [[10:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37511.72s)]
*  that was me then this is me now and i'm a different person and i will act differently [[10:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37519.64s)]

*  things he said to a certain extent but i've covered fbi directors uh i'm embarrassed to say [[10:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37597.24s)]

*  extent on the left and the right at this point it has become so polarized so partisan uh that um [[10:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37611.88s)]

*  Aviation disasters in this country are exceedingly rare. [[10:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37864.0s)]
*  This one was unique. [[10:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37867.88s)]
*  The collision midair of a commercial aircraft and a military helicopter. [[10:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37869.48s)]
*  Not very far from the Pentagon. [[10:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37876.12s)]
*  That means the civilian authorities in our country, the National Transportation Safety [[10:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37878.0s)]
*  Board and the Pentagon will be collaborating in the investigation to find out how this [[10:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37882.12s)]
*  occurred. [[10:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37888.0s)]
*  To give us some valuable insight into that process, I want to bring in Bradley Bowman. [[10:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37889.0s)]
*  He is the senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation [[10:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37892.96000000001s)]
*  for Defense of Democracies and importantly for this conversation, a former Blackhawk [[10:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37898.28s)]
*  helicopter pilot. [[10:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37903.12s)]
*  And that was the other of the two aircraft involved in this tragedy. [[10:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37905.240000000005s)]
*  Bradley, it's great to have you with us. [[10:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37910.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37912.28s)]
*  You've flown a Blackhawk. [[10:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37913.28s)]
*  Have you flown this particular corridor in the nation's capital? [[10:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37914.6s)]
*  Yes, many times. [[10:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37917.92s)]
*  I was in the 12th Aviation Battalion for two years and I commanded Charlie Company there, [[10:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37918.92s)]
*  including on the night of 9-11. [[10:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37923.76s)]
*  And I've thrown through that exact airspace many, many times. [[10:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37924.96s)]
*  What can you tell us about that process and what you believe may be implicated in what [[10:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37928.6s)]
*  has happened? [[10:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37933.48s)]
*  There's a system of low-level helicopter routes throughout the capital region that goes above [[10:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37934.68s)]
*  a lot of the freeways and along the Potomac. [[10:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37940.94s)]
*  And it is a very normal routine thing for military helicopters to fly along those routes. [[10:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37943.28s)]
*  As you're flying past Reagan National Airport, you go down to around 200 feet to de-conflict [[10:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37949.340000000004s)]
*  that helicopter passage with the aircraft flying in and out of Reagan. [[10:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37954.92s)]
*  It's a system that's been in place for decades and throughout that time period it's ensured [[10:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37959.44s)]
*  the safe de-confliction of those helicopters and aircraft flying in and out of Reagan. [[10:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37963.4s)]
*  But last night that system failed and I think it's really important to understand why. [[10:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37968.52s)]
*  So something horrible like this never happens again. [[10:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37972.44s)]
*  That hard deck terminology, 200 feet, how important is that in the safety of this entire [[10:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37974.9s)]
*  complex system of movement of aircraft and helicopter? [[10:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37980.44s)]
*  Throughout the entire system there's a prescribed route and a prescribed altitude you're supposed [[10:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37984.68s)]
*  to be at. [[10:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37989.04s)]
*  And that altitude becomes particularly important right there at Reagan National Airport because [[10:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37990.04s)]
*  as you're flying you literally have aircraft coming in and out and you have to stay at [[10:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37994.119999999995s)]
*  that altitude. [[10:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37997.88s)]
*  It's not really a hard deck. [[10:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=37998.88s)]
*  It's a don't fly above that as the helicopter so that you have what we call in aviation [[10:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38000.08s)]
*  de-confliction, just the spacing horizontally and vertically to make sure there's not a [[10:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38005.32s)]
*  mid-air collision. [[10:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38009.38s)]
*  And for some reason that failed last night. [[10:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38010.38s)]
*  Tammy Duckworth, senator from Illinois, told our Nicole Killian that based on an FAA briefing, [[10:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38012.56s)]
*  air traffic control spoke with the helicopter crew to her knowledge twice and the helicopter [[10:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38019.119999999995s)]
*  crew acknowledged instructions about where to be twice. [[10:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38025.84s)]
*  Does that tell you anything important? [[10:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38030.159999999996s)]
*  That sounds like the routine protocol when I would be flying north to south on the Potomac. [[10:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38031.479999999996s)]
*  You'd check in as the helicopter pilot with the tower at Reagan and you would not proceed [[10:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38036.04s)]
*  past Key Bridge for those who know, unless you had clearance to do so or you wouldn't [[10:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38041.04s)]
*  go past Wilson Bridge in the south without clearance to do so. [[10:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38045.48s)]
*  And there is a recording and it is a limited insight into the air traffic control communication [[10:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38049.48s)]
*  with the helicopter but it does have an ask and answer process in which the control tower [[10:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38056.52s)]
*  asks do you see the regional jet and there is an affirmation or a confirmation yes. [[10:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38061.72s)]
*  And yet this catastrophe occurred. [[10:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38068.44s)]
*  Is it possible air traffic control and the crew on the helicopter were talking about [[10:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38071.28s)]
*  a different plane being observed? [[10:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38076.4s)]
*  That's exactly what I was going to say. [[10:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38078.32s)]
*  If you look at the video closely there was another aircraft taking off and so what may [[10:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38079.840000000004s)]
*  have happened and we're going to need to follow the investigation, this is informed conjecture, [[10:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38083.9s)]
*  respectful of the investigators of course and the gravity of the situation, is that [[10:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38087.96s)]
*  the crew would have checked in at Key Bridge, they would have given them permission to proceed, [[10:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38092.24s)]
*  speed up, slow down, hold, they would have proceeded. [[10:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38096.520000000004s)]
*  They say we have an aircraft taking off, runway whatever, do you see it, go behind that. [[10:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38098.6s)]
*  They would have said will comply. [[10:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38103.6s)]
*  The tower was probably talking about the fixed wing aircraft that they ultimately collided [[10:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38106.92s)]
*  with. [[10:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38110.76s)]
*  The crew may have seen the other aircraft, been watching the other aircraft, not realizing [[10:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38111.76s)]
*  that the tower was talking about the aircraft they would ultimately collide with. [[10:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38117.26s)]
*  That's possible. [[10:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38120.36s)]
*  Before I let you go, there's been questions about whether or not this crew would have [[10:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38121.36s)]
*  circumstances in a flight of this kind be wearing night vision goggles or would they [[10:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38125.92s)]
*  have been doing something called visual flight rules? [[10:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38130.72s)]
*  Right, when I was flying this more than 20 years ago we didn't have night vision goggles [[10:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38133.28s)]
*  and it was just fine and it was safe. [[10:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38137.159999999996s)]
*  In this situation night vision goggles I think would almost be unhelpful because it reduces [[10:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38139.2s)]
*  your field of view and your peripheral vision and over a city with lots of lights that's [[10:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38143.52s)]
*  too much light for night vision goggles so that will be a key investigation. [[10:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38147.799999999996s)]
*  Were they wearing NVGs and how did that impact what happened? [[10:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38151.68s)]
*  Powerful insight Bradley Bowman, thank you. [[10:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38155.759999999995s)]
*  Thank you sir. [[10:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38157.64s)]
*  Appreciate it very much. [[10:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38158.64s)]
*  That does it for today. [[10:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38159.64s)]
*  We'll be back with another edition of America Decides Tomorrow at 5pm Eastern. [[10:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38160.64s)]
*  The Daily Report. [[10:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38164.439999999995s)]
*  Start. [[10:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38165.439999999995s)]
*  Welcome to the Daily Report on this Thursday, January 30th. [[10:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38166.439999999995s)]
*  I'm Lindsay Reiser. [[10:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38171.64s)]
*  Recovery efforts are underway after a deadly mid-air collision between a passenger jet [[10:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38173.28s)]
*  and a military aircraft near the nation's capital. [[10:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38177.52s)]
*  What we know so far about the victims, the investigation and the moments that led up [[10:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38180.56s)]
*  to the crash. [[10:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38184.08s)]
*  Both the helicopter and the plane crashed in the river. [[10:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38187.08s)]
*  At this point we don't believe there are any survivors from this accident. [[10:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38190.0s)]
*  We do not know enough facts to be able to rule in or out human factor, mechanical factors. [[10:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38193.48s)]
*  That is part of the NTSB investigative process. [[10:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38199.8s)]
*  It would be interesting to see what's on the cockpit voice recorder, what the airline crew [[10:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38202.0s)]
*  was saying to each other. [[10:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38206.76s)]
*  It's just going to take a lot of hard detective work to ultimately get to the answer. [[10:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38208.16s)]
*  When Americans take off in airplanes, they should expect to land at their destination. [[10:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38213.08s)]
*  That didn't happen yesterday. [[10:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38219.28s)]
*  That's not acceptable. [[10:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38220.28s)]
*  President Trump says he's immediately appointing a new acting FAA commissioner. [[10:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38222.32s)]
*  He also went after hiring practices under the previous administration. [[10:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38226.240000000005s)]
*  I put safety first. [[10:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38230.64s)]
*  Obama, Biden and the Democrats put policy first. [[10:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38232.12s)]
*  Our efforts now are focused entirely on the needs of our passengers, crew members, partners, [[10:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38235.16s)]
*  first responders, along with their families and loved ones. [[10:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38241.0s)]
*  Two coaches, two teenage athletes and the athletes' moms. [[10:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38244.28s)]
*  This will have long reaching impacts for our skating community. [[10:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38249.8s)]
*  You don't have to know everybody to feel that connection somehow picking yourself back up, [[10:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38254.2s)]
*  which is like the main lesson I think learned in skating is you get back up. [[10:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38259.28s)]
*  Hello and thank you for joining us. [[10:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38271.0s)]
*  A recovery mission is underway for the victims of a deadly midair collision between an American [[10:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38275.4s)]
*  Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter near the nation's capital. [[10:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38280.0s)]
*  Sixty passengers and four crew members were on board American Eagle flight 5342. [[10:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38284.64s)]
*  Three soldiers were on board the Army Black Hawk helicopter at the time of the crash. [[10:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38289.96s)]
*  Investigators believe there are no survivors. [[10:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38295.0s)]
*  Two aircraft collided around nine p.m. Eastern time Wednesday night. [[10:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38297.16s)]
*  Transportation officials say the passenger jet was following a standard flight path heading [[10:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38301.240000000005s)]
*  into Reagan National Airport. [[10:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38305.44s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the Army helicopter had been conducting a routine training [[10:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38307.54s)]
*  mission. [[10:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38313.12s)]
*  CBS News has also learned there was only one air traffic control worker managing both the [[10:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38314.12s)]
*  helicopters and planes coming into the airport, a job normally done by two people. [[10:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38318.200000000004s)]
*  Earlier, President Trump, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Secretary Hegseth spoke about [[10:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38323.04s)]
*  Wednesday's crash. [[10:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38328.12s)]
*  This was a dark and excruciating night in our nation's capital and in our nation's [[10:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38330.56s)]
*  history and a tragedy of terrible proportions. [[10:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38335.32s)]
*  What happened yesterday shouldn't have happened. [[10:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38339.7s)]
*  It should not have happened. [[10:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38342.68s)]
*  And when Americans take off in airplanes, they should expect to land at their destination. [[10:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38344.56s)]
*  That didn't happen yesterday. [[10:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38350.9s)]
*  That's not acceptable. [[10:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38353.2s)]
*  The military does dangerous things. [[10:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38354.2s)]
*  It does routine things on the regular basis. [[10:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38355.2s)]
*  Tragically last night, a mistake was made. [[10:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38358.4s)]
*  We're learning the identities of some of the victims, including Russian figure skating [[10:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38362.119999999995s)]
*  coaches Vadim Novav and Jenya Shishkova. [[10:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38365.96s)]
*  They were on their way back from a training camp in Wichita, Kansas. [[10:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38370.159999999996s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Skylar Henry joins us now from Arlington, Virginia. [[10:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38373.56s)]
*  Skylar, what's the status of search and recovery efforts at this time? [[10:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38377.159999999996s)]
*  Yeah, authorities tell CBS News that they've recovered 40 bodies up until this point. [[10:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38382.76s)]
*  They say that investigators have assessed all that they can as it relates to the remains [[10:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38388.68s)]
*  that they can retrieve. [[10:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38393.92s)]
*  They stopped all of their operations at dusk and say that they will continue to move forward [[10:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38395.08s)]
*  with their work in the morning time. [[10:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38400.36s)]
*  They say that they fear that some bodies may not be recovered, but they will be looking [[10:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38402.56s)]
*  in the tail of the wreckage to see what they can recover tomorrow morning. [[10:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38408.88s)]
*  As it relates to this investigation in and of itself, NTSB announced today that they [[10:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38413.84s)]
*  will be moving forward with it through a meticulous, clear and steady operation that is made up [[10:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38418.28s)]
*  of several parts, including a systems analysis group, as well as one that reviews the human [[10:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38425.4s)]
*  performance aspect of this crash. [[10:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38432.1s)]
*  And that includes the conversations between air traffic control that you talked about [[10:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38436.28s)]
*  with the pilots of both of those aircraft. [[10:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38440.560000000005s)]
*  It also will look at what went wrong as it relates to the systems. [[10:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38443.4s)]
*  They will look at the radar and the flight pattern and try to reconstruct the aircraft [[10:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38448.04s)]
*  itself. [[10:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38453.04s)]
*  They will also try to look for those black boxes. [[10:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38454.04s)]
*  As of this hour, they say that they've yet to receive or find either of them on the aircraft [[10:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38457.68s)]
*  itself. [[10:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38464.72s)]
*  They also say that they are looking for the flight data recorder, which the NTSB chair [[10:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38466.68s)]
*  said was still underwater at this time. [[10:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38470.44s)]
*  They also said that they didn't want to get ahead of any sort of preliminary findings. [[10:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38473.48s)]
*  We know that there has been chatter out there as far as assumptions, presumptions, rumors, [[10:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38478.28s)]
*  even from members of the Trump administration, including the president himself. [[10:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38483.92s)]
*  But they say that they will take their time, they will do their work steadily and try to [[10:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38488.08s)]
*  find a preliminary report and release that in the next 30 days. [[10:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38491.880000000005s)]
*  What do we know about the victims? [[10:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38495.72s)]
*  We are learning quite a bit. [[10:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38499.600000000006s)]
*  You pointed out some of the figure skaters who were on board the commercial regional [[10:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38501.44s)]
*  jet. [[10:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38508.72s)]
*  President Trump also brought this up during the briefing earlier today that several other [[10:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38510.200000000004s)]
*  passengers have international backgrounds, that they were notifying those countries as [[10:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38515.16s)]
*  well. [[10:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38522.04s)]
*  Something else that the NTSB pointed out during their press conference was that they've still [[10:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38523.04s)]
*  yet to be in contact with all of the relatives of those who may be on board those aircraft. [[10:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38527.96000000001s)]
*  So they're still waiting to make those connections as far as a family briefing. [[10:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38535.240000000005s)]
*  They say that those processes are still underway and also getting those family members here [[10:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38538.920000000006s)]
*  to Washington, D.C. [[10:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38544.56s)]
*  They say that they are still trying to set aside time, wrap their arms around the family [[10:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38545.88s)]
*  members all together to do everything they can for them as they wait to look to see what [[10:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38552.72s)]
*  happens next and how to move forward with this unspeakable tragedy. [[10:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38557.32s)]
*  Can you walk us through the scope of the investigation, who's involved and what progress they've [[10:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38561.04s)]
*  made so far? [[10:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38564.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[10:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38566.4s)]
*  The NTSB is leading this investigation, but there is really an all hands on deck approach [[10:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38568.2s)]
*  in terms of trying to help with this now recovery process. [[10:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38573.32s)]
*  That includes from the local officials here in Washington, D.C. [[10:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38577.32s)]
*  We've seen state partners from Virginia and Maryland come in as well, all trying to do [[10:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38581.479999999996s)]
*  their part to wade through the wreckage and really assist on this. [[10:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38586.67999999999s)]
*  As for the NTSB investigation that I was talking about before, they say that they will continue [[10:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38591.24s)]
*  to not only review what happened, but they will also sort of break this all down into [[10:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38596.4s)]
*  particular groups so that every aspect of this investigation can be covered. [[10:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38602.64s)]
*  They also say that they will be working with the military because this was a Black Hawk [[10:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38608.46s)]
*  helicopter that was involved in this. [[10:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38613.16s)]
*  They say that they will be working with the military and the DOD to try to figure out [[10:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38615.36s)]
*  what they can learn from that aircraft as well. [[10:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38619.36s)]
*  Was there any sort of mistake that may have happened between air traffic control and the [[10:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38622.56s)]
*  pilot of that Black Hawk helicopter? [[10:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38626.399999999994s)]
*  Was there some sort of malfunction on board some of the aircraft? [[10:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38629.52s)]
*  In fact, I asked one of the NTSB board members about that because Defense Secretary Pete [[10:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38633.2s)]
*  Hegseth mentioned that a mistake was made last night. [[10:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38637.52s)]
*  So we were trying to figure out whether that was human error or was that something that [[10:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38640.799999999996s)]
*  could be potentially mechanical? [[10:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38645.88s)]
*  They did not want to jump the gun just yet. [[10:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38647.439999999995s)]
*  They say that this investigation will take time, but they also said that this will be [[10:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38649.84s)]
*  a speedy investigation as they look to try to find answers into what went wrong last night. [[10:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38653.64s)]
*  Skyler Henry, thank you. [[10:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38659.119999999995s)]
*  CBS News Pentagon reporter Eleanor Watson joins us now. [[10:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38661.96s)]
*  Ellie, an Army aviation rep, gave an update today saying the pilots on the Black Hawk [[10:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38664.92s)]
*  helicopter were experienced. [[10:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38668.64s)]
*  This is a relatively easy corridor, according to that person. [[10:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38670.67999999999s)]
*  Can you provide more detail on that? [[10:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38673.719999999994s)]
*  Is it normal for the Army to conduct a training mission like this so close to a busy airport [[10:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38675.67999999999s)]
*  at night? [[10:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38679.8s)]
*  U.S. officials today said that the crew of this Black Hawk helicopter was very experienced [[10:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38682.560000000005s)]
*  and would have known this route along the Potomac River near the Reagan airport. [[10:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38687.880000000005s)]
*  One U.S. official said that this should not have been a problem because this is a route [[10:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38694.36s)]
*  that is taken regularly on a daily basis. [[10:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38697.8s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that the Black Hawk last night was involved in an annual [[10:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38701.4s)]
*  training exercise when it collided with the passenger jet. [[10:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38708.44s)]
*  Now what's confounding about this is that it's not irregular to see military helicopters [[10:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38710.96s)]
*  along the Potomac near Reagan airport. [[10:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38715.920000000006s)]
*  That happens all the time. [[10:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38719.840000000004s)]
*  Officials say that the passenger plane was on a standard flight path and so was the military [[10:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38721.840000000004s)]
*  helicopter. [[10:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38726.96s)]
*  But what happened last night is obviously a tragic anomaly. [[10:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38728.36s)]
*  You've actually ridden in a Black Hawk helicopter. [[10:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38733.520000000004s)]
*  What is it like and what is the significance of both the height at which the helicopter [[10:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38735.36s)]
*  was flying and whether they were using night vision goggles? [[10:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38738.76s)]
*  Black Hawks are one of the preferred modes of transportation for senior Pentagon officials [[10:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38743.96s)]
*  like the Defense Secretary. [[10:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38749.3s)]
*  The most recent time I was in a Black Hawk was in December with Secretary of Defense [[10:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38750.88s)]
*  Lloyd Austin when he was visiting Tokyo. [[10:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38754.76s)]
*  From my experience, the soldiers in the Black Hawk are constantly scanning the horizon, [[10:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38757.36s)]
*  looking from each side and forward for anything that could be in the way. [[10:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38764.16s)]
*  The flights in a Black Hawk have the best view of the city because they are at a lower [[10:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38770.76s)]
*  elevation. [[10:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38779.76s)]
*  Now in DC, the ceiling around the Reagan airport on that stretch of the Potomac is 200 feet. [[10:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38780.76s)]
*  That's because it is so heavily congested. [[10:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38789.76s)]
*  That is the ceiling. [[10:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38793.12s)]
*  What investigators will be looking at going forward is at what altitude was that helicopter [[10:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38794.520000000004s)]
*  flying? [[10:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38800.32s)]
*  You mentioned night vision goggles. [[10:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38801.32s)]
*  We have a little bit of conflicting information from Secretary of Defense Hegseth and President [[10:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38803.96s)]
*  Trump. [[10:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38809.96s)]
*  It's not clear whether they were wearing the night vision goggles last night. [[10:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38810.96s)]
*  Both Secretary Hegseth and President Trump have said that there were night vision goggles [[10:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38814.840000000004s)]
*  on board, but whether they were wearing them, we're not sure. [[10:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38820.26s)]
*  I bring that up only because people have speculated that when you're wearing night vision goggles, [[10:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38824.78s)]
*  it restricts your peripheral vision, and the soldiers on board may not have seen objects [[10:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38829.420000000006s)]
*  in the sky. [[10:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38836.9s)]
*  Army officials today said that these crews are trained specifically to wear night vision [[10:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38838.060000000005s)]
*  goggles but also scan the horizon. [[10:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38843.14s)]
*  While it may restrict some vision, they are trained to be able to see throughout the sky. [[10:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38846.58s)]
*  Eleanor Watson, thank you. [[10:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38853.380000000005s)]
*  CBS News transportation safety expert and analyst Robert Sumwalt joins us now. [[10:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38855.380000000005s)]
*  He's also former chair of the National Transportation Safety Board. [[10:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38859.14s)]
*  Robert, thanks for being here. [[10:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38862.3s)]
*  What's your initial analysis so far? [[10:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38863.42s)]
*  No analysis at this point. [[10:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38866.14s)]
*  I think it's most important that we allow the NTSB to gather the factual information [[10:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38867.46s)]
*  and then let the analysis phase go from there. [[10:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38873.02s)]
*  Speaking of that though, President Trump honed in on the helicopter in a briefing Thursday, [[10:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38877.02s)]
*  seemed to question whether they were in the right place at the right time. [[10:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38880.619999999995s)]
*  What questions do you have regarding that, what we were just talking about with Ellie, [[10:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38883.619999999995s)]
*  the height they were flying at and whether they were wearing night vision goggles? [[10:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38887.38s)]
*  Well, I think one thing that I'm really interested in is why was the helicopter that close laterally [[10:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38890.1s)]
*  to the arriving airplane? [[10:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38896.78s)]
*  Why was that airplane spaced so that it would arrive at the same point in space as the airplane? [[10:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38899.38s)]
*  What challenges do pilots face in general in this busy corridor, especially at night? [[10:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38905.82s)]
*  This airport, I was an airline pilot for 24 years. [[10:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38909.74s)]
*  I've landed at that airport and on that runway many times. [[10:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38912.02s)]
*  I don't think that's a particularly challenging airport. [[10:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38915.85999999999s)]
*  You certainly have got to be on your toes. [[10:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38918.78s)]
*  It's a little different than most airports, but if you handle it right, it's not a problem [[10:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38920.74s)]
*  at all. [[10:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38924.979999999996s)]
*  Some sources confirm to CBS News that one air traffic control worker was managing both [[10:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38926.020000000004s)]
*  the helicopters and the planes in the area. [[10:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38930.14000000001s)]
*  That's usually monitored by two people. [[10:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38932.66s)]
*  How serious and unusual would that be? [[10:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38934.82s)]
*  Well, I'm really concerned about that. [[10:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38937.9s)]
*  The first accident that I went to is an NTSB board member. [[10:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38939.9s)]
*  We found that there was only one controller on duty. [[10:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38943.100000000006s)]
*  There were supposed to be two. [[10:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38945.94s)]
*  If supposedly if two controllers would have been there, the accident may not have occurred. [[10:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38947.94s)]
*  So I'm concerned about that. [[10:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38952.62s)]
*  I want to know why this would be the case. [[10:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38954.18s)]
*  As former NTSB chair, what information can investigators glean from what they recover [[10:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38956.86s)]
*  at the scene, particularly the black boxes, the flight recorders, debris, even passenger [[10:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38962.58s)]
*  cell phones? [[10:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38967.98s)]
*  Yeah, the good question. [[10:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38968.98s)]
*  A lot of people forget about the cell phones. [[10:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38969.98s)]
*  There's some good information that the NTSB can recover from those. [[10:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38972.42s)]
*  The recorders are so important, especially the cockpit voice recorder, because it provides [[10:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38975.82s)]
*  the most direct evidence of what was going on inside of that cockpit. [[10:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38980.54s)]
*  So even though they may be waterlogged, information can still be gleaned from them? [[10:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38985.1s)]
*  Absolutely. [[10:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38989.26s)]
*  These recorders were only in less than 10 feet of water, so it's not a problem at all. [[10:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38990.26s)]
*  What information can be gleaned from passenger cell phones? [[10:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38995.18s)]
*  Well, in some cases, you know, I've seen balloon, hot air balloon accidents where everybody's [[10:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=38997.38s)]
*  taking pictures because it's a joyous occasion. [[10:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39004.16s)]
*  Here it's night. [[10:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39006.9s)]
*  I'm not sure that there would be a lot of personal cell phone photos going on at the [[10:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39007.9s)]
*  time, but the board will certainly try and retrieve data from those. [[10:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39012.14s)]
*  I have to ask you something that's been on my mind since this happened, and I think it's [[10:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39017.380000000005s)]
*  probably on the mind of a lot of people. [[10:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39020.9s)]
*  Is it safe to fly right now? [[10:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39023.020000000004s)]
*  Absolutely, it's safe, and I want to put it in perspective, and I don't want to sound [[10:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39024.74s)]
*  trite about the disaster that happened last night. [[10:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39028.3s)]
*  But we've gone 16 years without a fatal crash with a major airline, with an airline in this [[10:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39033.06s)]
*  country, with a U.S. airline. [[10:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39039.06s)]
*  I think that says something right there, that there's a lot of safeguards in the system [[10:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39041.259999999995s)]
*  that have kept the system as accident-free as it has been. [[10:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39045.299999999996s)]
*  Yes, there have been close calls, but there's multiple layers of defense that when one error [[10:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39049.42s)]
*  is made, it's caught by another. [[10:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39054.5s)]
*  Obviously, last night, those layers of defense were breached. [[10:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39056.82s)]

*  Well, obviously, something did not go properly. [[10:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39080.26s)]
*  I think to say that it's a mistake. [[10:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39083.58s)]
*  Let's let the data find out. [[10:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39086.58s)]

*  CBS News Chief White House correspondent Nancy Cortez joins me now from the White House. [[10:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39345.98s)]
*  Can you help put into perspective these claims that the president is making without evidence [[10:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39349.82s)]
*  regarding DEI and why he's making these declarations based on what he's calling common sense? [[10:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39353.62s)]
*  Sure, Lizzie. [[10:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39358.66s)]
*  He claimed repeatedly in that press conference and then later in the Oval Office that he [[10:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39360.16s)]
*  had increased the standards at the FAA for air traffic controllers when he was president [[10:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39365.78s)]
*  during his first term, but that they were much lower during the Obama years and that [[10:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39371.5s)]
*  Biden then lowered them again. [[10:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39375.74s)]
*  We have been asking the White House all day for any proof that that is actually the case, [[10:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39379.4s)]
*  that he somehow raised the standards because other officials we've been speaking to say [[10:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39384.82s)]
*  that isn't the case. [[10:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39389.0s)]
*  The White House provided us with a link to a class action lawsuit that was filed back [[10:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39390.6s)]
*  in 2016 by some individuals who said that the Obama FAA had changed the entry test for [[10:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39396.200000000004s)]
*  air traffic controllers to make it more difficult for white people to get accepted into the [[10:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39404.06s)]
*  pool. [[10:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39410.06s)]
*  I don't know the status and the validity of that lawsuit, but what I can tell you is that [[10:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39411.06s)]
*  they weren't able to provide us with any actual direct evidence that he had overhauled the [[10:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39417.74s)]
*  standards for air traffic controllers when he was president, and if that had actually [[10:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39423.5s)]
*  happened that would be something that would be pretty easy to do. [[10:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39428.38s)]
*  What experts tell me is that actually the standards for air traffic controllers have [[10:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39433.22s)]
*  always been quite high, Lindsey. [[10:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39436.659999999996s)]
*  It requires two to four years of training, about half of the individuals who start the [[10:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39439.94s)]
*  program end up dropping out along the way. [[10:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39444.74s)]
*  And so the biggest challenge when it comes to air traffic controllers usually hasn't [[10:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39447.58s)]
*  been the standards. [[10:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39450.659999999996s)]
*  It's been a shortage trying to find enough people to willing to go through all of that [[10:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39451.78s)]
*  training. [[10:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39456.34s)]
*  Following the collision, President Trump announced a new acting FAA administrator. [[10:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39457.34s)]
*  What do we know about who he chose and what their job will be? [[10:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39461.619999999995s)]
*  Right. [[10:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39464.619999999995s)]
*  His name is Chris Rochelot. [[10:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39465.619999999995s)]
*  He's a U.S. Air Force veteran. [[10:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39466.619999999995s)]
*  He actually worked at the FAA for 20 years, so he's got a lot of experience there. [[10:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39469.299999999996s)]
*  And they had to move quickly because there was something of a leadership vacuum at the [[10:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39475.619999999995s)]
*  FAA. [[10:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39479.78s)]
*  The former administrator actually stepped down on the same day that President Trump [[10:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39481.299999999996s)]
*  was inaugurated last Monday. [[10:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39486.259999999995s)]
*  He had several more years left on his term, but he had come under fire in recent months [[10:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39489.18s)]
*  by a close Trump ally, Elon Musk. [[10:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39492.54s)]
*  So he probably saw the writing on the wall, assumed that Trump would remove him once Trump [[10:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39495.86s)]
*  came into office. [[10:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39500.979999999996s)]
*  And so he beat him to the punch and left. [[10:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39501.979999999996s)]
*  But that meant that at the top of the FAA, you really had no clear line of command. [[10:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39503.82s)]
*  And obviously the FAA is going to be quite busy in the coming days and weeks. [[10:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39511.58s)]
*  And we know that this is Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy's second day. [[10:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39515.38s)]
*  What will he be tasked with? [[10:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39519.579999999994s)]
*  Well, he's getting a lot of feedback from members of Congress, from the White House [[10:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39521.579999999994s)]
*  about things that people are concerned about that they think may have contributed to this [[10:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39527.219999999994s)]
*  accident that he will likely have to examine, including the possibility of congestion at [[10:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39531.579999999994s)]
*  Reagan National Airport, the possibility that he may have to work with the Pentagon to revamp [[10:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39537.799999999996s)]
*  the rules for helicopters in the vicinity of Reagan National, all of this at a time [[10:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39542.88s)]
*  when he's still figuring out how to get to his office and who the people are who are [[10:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39547.439999999995s)]
*  surrounding him. [[10:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39552.88s)]
*  Because as you pointed out, he's been on the job for less than 48 hours. [[10:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39553.88s)]
*  Nancy Cortez, thank you. [[10:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39557.68s)]

*  What are you hearing from those in attendance? [[10:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39579.38s)]
*  Well, Lindsay, this is very much a community in shock. [[10:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39581.84s)]
*  People wondering how something like this could happen. [[10:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39586.4s)]
*  Being at that vigil earlier this afternoon, it was what stood out to me was just how many [[10:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39588.88s)]
*  people from the community who didn't have a direct connection to one of those passengers [[10:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39594.04s)]
*  turned up looking for some sort of solace. [[10:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39598.96s)]
*  This is a community that is very tight knit and so you are seeing a lot of grief. [[11:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39602.56s)]
*  I spoke with one woman though. [[11:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39606.84s)]

*  Welcome back to the Daily Report. [[11:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39960.64s)]
*  The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating what caused Wednesday night's [[11:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39982.68s)]
*  between a passenger jet and a military helicopter. [[11:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39987.64s)]
*  64 people were on the passenger jet and three soldiers were in the helicopter. [[11:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39990.64s)]
*  This crash comes after experts have been sounding the alarm about the growing number of near [[11:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39994.64s)]
*  collisions between airplanes on runways and in the air. [[11:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=39999.64s)]
*  Over the last two years, there have been at least five high-profile, serious close calls [[11:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40002.64s)]
*  at U.S. airports, including two at Reagan National Airport last year. [[11:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40008.64s)]
*  Both of those incidents happened within a month of each other. [[11:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40012.64s)]
*  In one case, a JetBlue and Southwest plane were cleared to proceed on a collision course [[11:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40015.64s)]
*  toward each other before air traffic controllers warned them to stop. [[11:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40019.64s)]
*  In another, an American Airlines plane nearly collided with another airplane that was landing [[11:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40023.64s)]
*  on a nearby runway before air traffic controllers intervened to stop the American Airlines flight. [[11:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40027.64s)]
*  These incidents are more serious examples of the problem of runway incursions, which is [[11:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40033.64s)]
*  when there's something, such as an aircraft vehicle or person, on a runway that shouldn't be there. [[11:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40037.64s)]
*  The FAA reported there were 30 runway incursions for every one million flights that take off in 2024, [[11:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40043.64s)]
*  only one of which was in the most serious category in which a collision was nearly avoided. [[11:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40049.64s)]
*  That's down slightly from 2023, when there were 33 runway incursions per million flights [[11:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40055.64s)]
*  and a total of 22 incidents in the two most serious categories of near collisions, the most in a decade. [[11:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40060.64s)]
*  The FAA launched a safety review after the rise in runway incursions in 2023 and found the rise [[11:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40067.64s)]
*  was caused by a variety of factors, including the need for more surface detection technology at airports, [[11:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40073.64s)]
*  which can help pilots identify where other planes are. [[11:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40079.64s)]
*  Inexperienced pilots and more air traffic controllers were also factors cited. [[11:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40083.64s)]
*  CBS News has also confirmed that one air traffic controller was doing the job of two people [[11:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40089.64s)]
*  at Reagan Airport Wednesday night. [[11:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40093.64s)]
*  Reagan Airport is one of many airports struggling to staff air traffic control towers. [[11:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40095.64s)]
*  As of September 2023, which is the most recent data available, there were a third less certified controllers [[11:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40100.64s)]
*  on staff than what both the FAA and Controllers Union call for. [[11:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40106.64s)]
*  Crews have suspended recovery operations for the night in the deadly crash near Washington. [[11:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40112.64s)]
*  They'll resume Friday morning, but a law enforcement source confirms to CBS News [[11:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40117.64s)]
*  Crews fear they may not be able to recover all of the victims' bodies. [[11:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40121.64s)]
*  According to a source familiar, they believe that there are more in a tail section of the fuselage [[11:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40125.64s)]
*  and currently out of reach. [[11:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40132.64s)]
*  For more, let's bring in Shannon Scaff. [[11:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40134.64s)]
*  He's a senior consultant for risk management at the Center for Toxicology and Environmental Health, or CTEH. [[11:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40136.64s)]
*  He's also a retired lieutenant commander with the U.S. Coast Guard. [[11:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40142.64s)]
*  Thank you very much for being here, Commander. [[11:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40145.64s)]
*  At what point does a search and rescue operation become a recovery operation? [[11:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40148.64s)]
*  Yeah, the Coast Guard's got some computer models in place that will help to take in a whole number of factors. [[11:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40154.64s)]
*  Obviously, water temperature being one of those, and at 36 degrees, the average human being with a life jacket on [[11:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40160.64s)]
*  has an expectancy of life of about an hour to an hour and a half. [[11:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40166.64s)]
*  They take a lot of different things into consideration and ultimately arrive to a decision to suspend an act of search [[11:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40170.64s)]
*  and rescue and go towards a recovery when it just makes sense to do that. [[11:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40177.64s)]
*  They will take into account a will to live, but that's for an individual that's healthy and is able to fight for their lives. [[11:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40182.64s)]
*  It's a difficult decision, but one they're prepared to make. [[11:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40191.64s)]
*  How does a water recovery complicate the operation and the ability to retrieve evidence? [[11:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40194.64s)]
*  This is going to be tough. I've been thinking about these folks all day. They're out there on the water and under the water. [[11:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40200.64s)]
*  They're dealing with terrible conditions out there. [[11:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40206.64s)]
*  Obviously, we all know the gravity of the situation and how tragic it is. [[11:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40208.64s)]
*  We shouldn't fool ourselves into thinking that these folks don't feel that. [[11:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40213.64s)]
*  They're out there in the middle of it, and they understand that family members are on the sidelines waiting to be reunited with their families. [[11:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40216.64s)]
*  They're out there in low visibility to zero visibility. They're fighting currents. [[11:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40227.64s)]
*  Today, the wind isn't so bad. Tomorrow, it's going to be bad. [[11:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40233.64s)]
*  Obviously, 36-degree water temperatures is something to be considering. [[11:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40235.64s)]
*  The cumbersome nature of the suits that they're wearing to stay warm. [[11:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40239.64s)]
*  The deck is stacked against them. Not to mention the fuselage themselves with the metals that are involved, the fuel and everything else. [[11:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40243.64s)]
*  It's just going to be a very hard operation for them. [[11:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40253.64s)]
*  You mentioned the weather. It's a little over 40 degrees in Washington. [[11:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40257.64s)]
*  How does that affect efforts and what other challenges do crews face? [[11:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40260.64s)]
*  The suits that they're wearing, there's a number of different options for them, but mostly dry suits, which is going to be a little more cumbersome for them. [[11:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40265.64s)]
*  They're not going to be able to be as mobile, so things are going to move a lot slower because they don't have the dexterity that they would have if they were out there in a shorty wetsuit. [[11:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40272.64s)]
*  That's very cumbersome. It takes a longer period of time to get through things, as you just covered a minute ago. [[11:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40284.64s)]
*  It's difficult to reach certain areas of the aircraft just because of its orientation and their ability to get in there. [[11:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40289.64s)]
*  Again, you've got a Coke can type metals that are very sharp when they're ripped open that would try to jeopardize a suit or an air hose. [[11:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40296.64s)]
*  They've got to consider all of that. [[11:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40305.64s)]
*  Wow. I hadn't even thought of that so complicated. [[11:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40307.64s)]
*  Retired Lieutenant Commander Shannon Scaff, thank you. [[11:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40309.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[11:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40312.64s)]
*  In other news today, three of President Trump's more controversial nominees for top government positions were on Capitol Hill. [[11:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40314.64s)]
*  Were there confirmation hearings? CBS News correspondent Meg Oliver has more. [[11:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40320.64s)]
*  The Senate Health Committee's top Republican said he's struggling with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination. [[11:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40325.64s)]
*  That's my dilemma, man. [[11:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40331.64s)]
*  Senator Bill Cassidy is a physician and says he's concerned by Kennedy's misleading arguments about vaccines. [[11:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40332.64s)]
*  If you come out unequivocally, vaccines are safe, it does not cause autism, that would have an incredible impact. [[11:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40339.64s)]
*  But earlier Kennedy said he'd first have to see the data. [[11:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40347.64s)]
*  If you show me data, I will be the first person to assure the American people that they need to take those vaccines. [[11:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40350.64s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard asked senators to confirm her as director of national intelligence and defended her position on Russia. [[11:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40359.64s)]
*  I want to make certain that in no way does Russia get a pass in either your mind or your heart or in any policy recommendation you would make or not make. [[11:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40366.64s)]
*  Senator, I'm offended by the question because my sole focus, commitment and responsibility is about our own nation. [[11:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40379.64s)]
*  Trump loyalist Cash Patel faced questions on his nomination to lead the FBI. [[11:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40390.64s)]
*  And I've never once advocated for political violence or violence against law enforcement. [[11:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40395.64s)]
*  Democrats called his statements about January 6th defendants disqualifying. [[11:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40399.64s)]
*  I'm talking about his characterization of criminals who assaulted police officers as political prisoners. [[11:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40404.64s)]
*  While his nominees make their case to Congress, President Trump returned to a campaign theme, instructing schools to promote a patriotic education. [[11:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40414.64s)]
*  An executive order threatens to withhold funding from schools that teach about gender ideology or critical race theory. [[11:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40423.64s)]
*  Meg Oliver, CBS News, New York. [[11:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40431.64s)]
*  CBS News congressional correspondent Nicole Killian joins me now from Capitol Hill. [[11:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40434.64s)]
*  So now that Thursday's hearings are done, do we have a sense of if they've heard or helped any of the nominees? [[11:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40438.64s)]
*  Well, it's really going to depend on a case by case basis. [[11:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40444.64s)]
*  You know, in the case of R.F. Kennedy Jr., of course, some of those responses that he gave back to, for instance, Senator Cassidy on the issue of vaccines and autism really gave Cassidy some pause. [[11:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40447.64s)]
*  And he is a Republican that someone like R.F.K. Jr. would need to try to clear the confirmation hurdles. [[11:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40460.64s)]
*  You know, with respect to Tulsi Gabbard, it seemed like many Republicans and Democrats had more questions than answers after her hearing today. [[11:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40467.64s)]
*  The only nominee who really seemed to have broad support among Republicans was Cash Patel, even though Democrats really tried to poke holes in some of his past statements, whether it was on the issue of January 6th, the 2020 election and just his broader views about the FBI. [[11:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40474.64s)]
*  So that being said, we will have to continue to see how these nominations play out. [[11:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40489.64s)]
*  But either way, none of these nominees can afford to lose many votes if they want to eventually secure their respective positions. [[11:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40495.64s)]
*  On the tragic story we've been following all day, you spoke with Senator Tammy Duckworth, who is also a retired Army National Guard member. [[11:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40503.64s)]
*  What insight, really particularly unique insight, was she able to give you? [[11:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40511.64s)]
*  Well, obviously she has the unique insight of having served and having flown a Black Hawk helicopter and having gone down in one. [[11:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40517.64s)]
*  And so I asked her more personally about her experiences when she served, particularly on a tour of duty in Iraq some 20 years ago, an incident where ultimately she ended up losing her legs. [[11:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40527.64s)]
*  She talked to me more specifically not only about that incident, but what came to mind for her when she learned about last night's crash. [[11:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40540.64s)]
*  Take a listen. [[11:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40549.64s)]
*  Every time I put myself back in that cockpit, back in that seat, I sat in for thousands of hours along with my crew. [[11:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40550.64s)]
*  I knew that those folks were looking outside the aircraft, looking for their passenger plane, that they were doing their job up until the very last moment. [[11:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40557.64s)]
*  They would not have, you know, panicked or quit. [[11:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40565.64s)]
*  And that's the best that you can hope for. [[11:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40568.64s)]
*  Take us inside of the cockpit and what is it like, particularly if you are flying in a populated area like Washington and at night? [[11:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40570.64s)]
*  Well, the crew members would have split up the crew duties. [[11:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40580.64s)]
*  One person would have been flying, the other pilot would be talking with air traffic control. [[11:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40583.64s)]
*  Everybody's looking outside the aircraft to try to find that other aircraft that you are near. [[11:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40587.64s)]
*  With respect to President Trump's remarks, he seemed to take aim at Democrats for DEI policies, suggesting that this could have been to blame for the crash. [[11:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40593.64s)]
*  How do you respond to that? [[11:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40605.64s)]
*  That's an attack on those pilots. [[11:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40607.64s)]
*  And how dare he, how dare the commander in chief of the greatest military in the face of the earth attack the soldiers who just died last night by saying that he's implying that they were not qualified to do their jobs. [[11:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40608.64s)]
*  He's implying that they were substandard as aviation air crew member because as if they had that position because of some other initiative that had nothing to do with their qualifications and capabilities as air crew members. [[11:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40619.64s)]
*  I am offended that the commander in chief of the United States military would actually say that about the soldiers that he has sworn to lead. [[11:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40632.64s)]
*  Shame on him. [[11:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40639.64s)]
*  And Senator Duckworth again caution that we need to let this investigation play out. [[11:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40642.64s)]
*  She was briefed earlier today and said that she has requested more details. [[11:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40647.64s)]
*  She is also somebody who has sounded the alarm about concerns with respect to congestion, whether it is at Reagan National Airport and other airports across the country in terms of aviation safety. [[11:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40652.64s)]
*  She did point to the recent reauthorization of the FAA, which does provide more funding to train, for instance, air traffic controllers. [[11:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40663.64s)]
*  But obviously that is a process that takes time and she acknowledged that Congress may still have more work to do around this issue. [[11:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40671.64s)]
*  Nicole Kellyanne, thank you. [[11:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40678.64s)]
*  Still to come, more hostages are released from Gaza and a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel amid a new message from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[11:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40681.64s)]

*  Crushing crowds surrounded 29-year-old Yehud who looked terrified as Hamas fighters moved her along. [[11:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40913.64s)]
*  Earlier Thursday in another part of Gaza, 20-year-old Agam Berger, an Israeli soldier, was set free. [[11:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40920.64s)]
*  It's the third time militants have let hostages go since a ceasefire took hold in the Gaza Strip earlier this month. [[11:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40926.64s)]
*  And was a stark contrast to the slick choreography of previous releases. [[11:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40934.64s)]
*  The frantic scene sparked outrage from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who ordered a delay in Thursday's Palestinian prisoner exchange. [[11:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40939.64s)]
*  Hours later, more than 100 were turned over. [[11:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40947.64s)]
*  In Tel Aviv, Israelis celebrated the homecoming of more hostages. [[11:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40951.64s)]
*  But there was desperation for the return of the rest. [[11:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40956.64s)]
*  We need them all, the dead ones and the alive, hostages, everybody back. [[11:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40959.64s)]

*  John, could this chaotic handover jeopardize a ceasefire deal and future releases? What are the biggest concerns? [[11:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40986.64s)]
*  I'm not sure that this handover jeopardizes it. It feels like they're certainly getting messier. [[11:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40993.64s)]
*  I think what's really going to start jeopardizing the deal is when there are no more live hostages to hand over. [[11:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=40997.64s)]
*  And Israel is intended to release live Palestinians in exchange for some Israeli body bags. [[11:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41003.64s)]
*  And I think that when that starts to happen, if that starts to happen, and I'm not sure that it will, but if that starts to happen, I think the politics in Israel will turn very, very dark about this exchange. [[11:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41010.64s)]
*  So that leads us to the second phase of the deal, which would need to extend and still needs to happen. [[11:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41021.64s)]
*  Do we have any idea of a timeline of when this phase ends and the next one could start? Or are things too precarious at this juncture to even talk about that? [[11:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41028.64s)]
*  Well, they're intended to start negotiating the second phase of the deal on Monday. And the first phase goes 42 days and it releases 33 hostages. [[11:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41035.64s)]
*  As I say, whether all of those hostages are alive, I'm not sure. This is for female soldiers and people not of military age and women who were not soldiers. [[11:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41046.64s)]
*  When you start getting to male soldiers, it's not even clear what the exchange would be. That's going to be a very hard set of negotiations for Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[11:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41059.64s)]
*  As I say, I think when there's a sense that Palestinians are exchanging dead Israelis for live Palestinians, I think that the mood is going to change and become much darker. [[11:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41069.64s)]
*  Middle East envoy for the Trump administration visited Gaza Wednesday before meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[11:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41080.64s)]
*  What is the goal of that visit and what is the significance of Prime Minister Netanyahu said to be President Trump's first foreign dignitary to visit the White House in his second term? [[11:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41087.64s)]
*  Well, I think President Trump wants to take some victory in this, that this is moving. [[11:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41096.64s)]
*  There's no question that Steve Woodcock, the presidential envoy, everybody wants to talk to him. Hamas wants to talk to him. [[11:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41102.64s)]
*  The Qataris want to talk to him. The Egyptians want to talk to him. [[11:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41109.64s)]
*  And President Trump certainly has created a sense of momentum that wasn't there at all. [[11:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41112.64s)]
*  But where this goes, if it goes in a constructive direction or not, a positive direction or not, I'm much less sure. [[11:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41117.64s)]
*  I'm not skeptical, but I'm just not sure where this is going to go. [[11:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41124.64s)]
*  And some of the decisions that people are talking about, I think a lot of people in the region think would be very disruptive. [[11:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41129.64s)]
*  I don't think are likely to come to fruition, but certainly there is a mood of negotiation that wasn't there just a few weeks ago. [[11:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41135.64s)]

*  Good evening. Well, we're wrapping up what has been an incredibly somber day [[11:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41377.64s)]
*  here at the Ashburn Ice House. [[11:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41380.64s)]
*  This skating club, which is believed to be directly impacted by the disaster [[11:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41382.64s)]
*  that happened overnight. [[11:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41387.64s)]
*  Now, we saw a steady stream of people, many of them flowers in hand, [[11:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41389.64s)]
*  going inside throughout the day, making sort of a makeshift memorial [[11:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41393.64s)]
*  to pay tribute to the people who passed away in the crash over the Potomac. [[11:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41398.64s)]
*  One thing that I do want to point out is a statement that Ice House recently put out. [[11:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41403.64s)]
*  It says, it is with heavy hearts that we have learned that our figure skating community [[11:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41408.64s)]
*  has been directly affected. [[11:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41412.64s)]
*  As we learn more, we will follow up with additional information. [[11:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41413.64s)]
*  The figure skating community is close-knit, worldwide family, [[11:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41416.64s)]
*  and our hearts go out to all affected by this terrible tragedy. [[11:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41419.64s)]
*  And when they say it's a close-knit community, they mean it. [[11:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41423.64s)]
*  The people in this facility, they are training together, they are competing together. [[11:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41425.64s)]
*  Oftentimes they are traveling together. [[11:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41430.64s)]
*  And so what we saw today were members of the skating community [[11:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41432.64s)]
*  leaning on each other, grieving with each other, just an incredibly emotional scene inside. [[11:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41436.64s)]
*  Now, we are waiting, of course, for more of the identities of the people on the plane [[11:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41442.64s)]
*  to be disclosed. [[11:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41447.64s)]
*  And as we wait for those questions to be answered, the people out here are waiting too. [[11:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41450.64s)]
*  And they are waiting anxiously with anticipation. [[11:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41456.64s)]
*  One 14-year-old skater who we spoke to says that she believes that she lost several best friends [[11:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41459.64s)]
*  on the flight that went down. [[11:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41466.64s)]
*  And so she is just one of many people who are no doubt going to be grieving [[11:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41469.64s)]
*  and dealing with the profound nature of this loss for the days and weeks to come. [[11:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41474.64s)]

*  This really happened. [[11:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41750.64s)]
*  Have you told the government? [[11:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41751.64s)]

*  Welcome to The Daily Report. [[11:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41768.64s)]
*  On this Thursday, January 30th, I'm Lindsay Reiser. [[11:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41769.64s)]
*  Three efforts are underway after a deadly mid-air collision between a passenger jet [[11:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41772.64s)]
*  and a military aircraft near the nation's capital. [[11:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41777.64s)]
*  What we know so far about the victims, the investigation, and the moments that led up to the crash. [[11:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41780.64s)]
*  Both the helicopter and the plane crashed in the river. [[11:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41787.64s)]
*  At this point, we don't believe there are any survivors from this accident. [[11:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41789.64s)]
*  We do not know enough facts to be able to rule in or out human factor, mechanical factors. [[11:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41793.64s)]
*  That is part of the NTSB investigative process. [[11:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41799.64s)]
*  It would be interesting to see what's on the cockpit voice recorder, what the airline crew was saying to each other. [[11:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41801.64s)]
*  It's just going to take a lot of hard detective work to ultimately get to the answer. [[11:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41807.64s)]
*  When Americans take off in airplanes, they should expect to land at their destination. [[11:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41812.64s)]
*  That didn't happen yesterday. [[11:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41818.64s)]
*  That's not acceptable. [[11:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41820.64s)]
*  President Trump says he's immediately appointing a new acting FAA commissioner. [[11:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41821.64s)]
*  He also went after hiring practices under the previous administration. [[11:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41825.64s)]
*  I put safety first. Obama, Biden, and the Democrats put policy first. [[11:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41830.64s)]
*  Our efforts now are focused entirely on the needs of our passengers, crew members, partners, first responders, along with their families and loved ones. [[11:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41835.64s)]
*  Two coaches, two teenage athletes, and the athletes' moms. [[11:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41843.64s)]
*  This will have long-reaching impacts for our skating community. [[11:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41848.64s)]
*  You don't have to know everybody to feel that connection somehow picking yourself back up, [[11:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41853.64s)]
*  which is the main lesson I think learned in skating is you get back up. [[11:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41858.64s)]
*  Hello and thank you for joining us. [[11:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41874.64s)]
*  A federal investigation is underway in the deadly midair collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter near the nation's capital. [[11:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41875.64s)]
*  60 passengers and four crew members were on board American Eagle flight 5342. [[11:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41883.64s)]
*  Three soldiers were on board the Army Black Hawk helicopter at the time of the crash. [[11:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41888.64s)]
*  Investigators believe there are no survivors. [[11:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41893.64s)]
*  A source familiar with the investigation tells CBS News both plane black boxes have been recovered and are on their way to an NTSB lab. [[11:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41896.64s)]
*  The two aircraft collided around 9 p.m. Eastern Time Wednesday night. [[11:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41904.64s)]
*  Transportation officials say the passenger jet was following a standard flight path heading into Reagan National Airport. [[11:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41908.64s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the Army helicopter had been conducting a routine training mission. [[11:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41914.64s)]
*  CBS News has also learned there was only one air traffic control worker managing both helicopters and planes, a job normally done by two people. [[11:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41920.64s)]
*  Earlier, President Trump, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, and Secretary Hegseth spoke about Wednesday's crash. [[11:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41928.64s)]
*  This was a dark and excruciating night in our nation's capital and in our nation's history and a tragedy of terrible proportions. [[11:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41936.64s)]
*  What happened yesterday shouldn't have happened. [[11:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41945.64s)]
*  It should not have happened. [[11:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41948.64s)]
*  And when Americans take off in airplanes, they should expect to land at their destination. [[11:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41950.64s)]
*  That didn't happen yesterday. [[11:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41956.64s)]
*  That's not acceptable. [[11:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41958.64s)]
*  The military does dangerous things. It does routine things on the regular basis. [[11:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41959.64s)]
*  Tragically, last night, a mistake was made. [[11:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41963.64s)]
*  We're learning the identities of some of the victims, including Russian figure skating coaches Vadim Nomov and Jenya Shishkova. [[11:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41966.64s)]
*  They were on their way back from a training camp in Wichita, Kansas. [[11:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41974.64s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Skyler Henry joins us now from Arlington, Virginia. [[11:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41977.64s)]
*  Skyler, recovery efforts have ended for the night. [[11:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41982.64s)]
*  What progress was made and when will the search resume? [[11:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41985.64s)]
*  Yeah, well, we know that authorities were able to recover 40 bodies. [[11:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41988.64s)]
*  They say that they will continue to try to look for more tomorrow. [[11:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41993.64s)]
*  Once the sun comes back up, they believe that some may still be in the tail part of the fuselage in the wreckage in the Potomac. [[11:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=41999.64s)]
*  But they also have their challenges as well as the conditions in the river are increasingly dangerous and treacherous for those crews who have been working on the wreckage. [[11:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42009.64s)]
*  Crews who have been working around the clock to try to not only recover those bodies, but also get to the bottom of the wreckage in and of itself. [[11:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42016.64s)]
*  We heard from the NTSB today who held a press conference to talk about what plans they have in terms of moving forward with this investigation. [[11:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42024.64s)]
*  They say that they are in the preliminary stages of this process, but there are already specific groups within this investigation that will meticulously comb through all of the facts in terms of figuring out how this happened. [[11:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42032.64s)]
*  Everything from systems reviewing the radar and the altitude of both of those aircraft to human performance to what happened and who communicated with whom as it relates to air traffic control and the pilots on board those aircraft. [[11:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42045.64s)]
*  They say that they anticipate some results within the next 30 days, but they are working to move quickly and urgently to try to get to the bottom of so many questions. [[11:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42060.64s)]
*  How long could this investigation take and how significant is the recovery of these black boxes? [[11:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42070.64s)]
*  It is certainly significant. [[11:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42075.64s)]
*  What we heard from the NTSB earlier today, they had stressed that they wanted to make sure that they worked on the recovery aspect of getting those bodies back to shore as quickly as they could before moving forward with the other parts of the investigation. [[11:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42079.64s)]
*  There isn't as much of a timeline crunch, if you will, as it relates to gathering those black boxes. [[11:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42095.64s)]
*  There's also another aspect of this that is still underwater. [[11:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42100.64s)]
*  There's like a data recovery system that is still underwater. [[11:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42104.64s)]
*  The NTSB chair says that they are also working to try to pinpoint that because that will also be essential as they continue to work through this investigation. [[11:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42108.64s)]
*  They say that from here, as I pointed out, we could see the first results from their investigation come out within the next 30 days, but we know that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, President Trump for that matter, also urging some urgency here because they say that they need to figure out how this happened, why this happened, because yes, this is a congested airspace, but because so many commercial airlines fly in and out of here, because so many private jets fly in and out of here, and obviously they're not going to be able to get to the bottom of this. [[11:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42116.64s)]
*  Because so many private jets fly in and out of here and obviously so many military jets fly in and out of here. [[11:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42143.64s)]
*  They're trying to figure out why that routine seemed to come to a halt yesterday. [[11:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42149.64s)]
*  Skylar Henry, thank you. [[11:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42154.64s)]
*  You bet. [[11:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42157.64s)]
*  CBS News Pentagon reporter Eleanor Watson joins us now. [[11:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42158.64s)]
*  Ellie, an Army aviation rep, gave an update today saying the pilots on the Black Hawk helicopter were experienced. [[11:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42161.64s)]
*  This is a relatively easy corridor, according to that person. [[11:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42167.64s)]
*  Can you provide more detail on that? [[11:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42170.64s)]
*  Is it normal for the Army to conduct a training mission like this so close to a busy airport at night? [[11:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42172.64s)]
*  U.S. officials today said that the crew of this Black Hawk helicopter was very experienced and would have known this route along the Potomac River near the Reagan Airport. [[11:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42177.64s)]
*  One U.S. official said that this should not have been a problem because this is a route that is taken regularly on a daily basis. [[11:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42190.64s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegsess said that the Black Hawk last night was involved in an annual training exercise when it collided with the passenger jet. [[11:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42197.64s)]
*  Now, what's confounding about this is that it's not irregular to see military helicopters along the Potomac near Reagan Airport. [[11:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42206.64s)]
*  That happens all the time. [[11:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42215.64s)]
*  Officials say that the passenger plane was on a standard flight path and so was the military helicopter. [[11:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42217.64s)]
*  But what happened last night is obviously a tragic anomaly. [[11:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42224.64s)]
*  You've actually ridden in a Black Hawk helicopter. [[11:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42229.64s)]
*  What is it like and what is the significance of both the height at which the helicopter was flying and whether they were using night vision goggles? [[11:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42231.64s)]
*  Black Hawks are one of the preferred modes of transportation for senior Pentagon officials like the Defense Secretary. [[11:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42239.64s)]
*  The most recent time I was in a Black Hawk was in December with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin when he was visiting Tokyo. [[11:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42247.64s)]
*  And from my experience, the soldiers in the Black Hawk are constantly scanning the horizon, looking from each side and forward for anything that could be in the way. [[11:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42253.64s)]
*  Now, the elevation you speak of, the flights in a Black Hawk have the best view of the city because they are at a lower elevation. [[11:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42266.64s)]
*  Now, in D.C., the ceiling around the Reagan Airport on that stretch of the Potomac is 200 feet. [[11:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42276.64s)]
*  And that's because it is so heavily congested. [[11:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42285.64s)]
*  That is the ceiling. [[11:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42289.64s)]
*  And what investigators will be looking at going forward is at what altitude was that helicopter flying? [[11:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42290.64s)]
*  You mentioned night vision goggles. [[11:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42297.64s)]
*  We have a little bit of conflicting information from Secretary of Defense Hegseth and President Trump. [[11:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42300.64s)]
*  It's not clear whether they were wearing the night vision goggles last night. [[11:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42307.64s)]
*  Both Secretary Hegseth and President Trump have said that there were night vision goggles on board, but whether they were wearing them, we're not sure. [[11:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42311.64s)]
*  I bring that up only because people have speculated that when you're wearing night vision goggles, it restricts your peripheral vision. [[11:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42321.64s)]
*  And the soldiers on board may not have seen objects in the sky. [[11:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42329.64s)]
*  Army officials today said that these crews are trained specifically to wear night vision goggles, but also scan the horizon. [[11:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42334.64s)]
*  So while it may restrict some vision, they are trained to be able to see throughout the sky. [[11:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42342.64s)]
*  Eleanor Watson, thank you. CBS News transportation safety expert and analyst Robert Sumwalt joins us now. [[11:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42349.64s)]
*  He's also former chair of the National Transportation Safety Board. Robert, thanks for being here. [[11:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42355.64s)]
*  What's your initial analysis so far? [[11:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42359.64s)]
*  No analysis at this point. [[11:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42361.64s)]
*  I think it's most important that we allow the NTSB to gather the factual information and then let the analysis phase go from there. [[11:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42363.64s)]
*  Speaking of that, though, President Trump honed in on the helicopter in a briefing Thursday. [[11:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42372.64s)]
*  Seemed to question whether they were in the right place at the right time. [[11:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42376.64s)]
*  What questions do you have regarding that? What we were just talking about with Ellie, the height they were flying at and whether they were wearing night vision goggles. [[11:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42379.64s)]
*  Well, I think one thing that I'm really interested in is why was the helicopter that close laterally to the arriving airplane? [[11:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42386.64s)]
*  Why was that airplane spaced so that it would arrive at the same point in space as the airplane? [[11:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42395.64s)]
*  What challenges do pilots face in general in this busy corridor, especially at night? [[11:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42401.64s)]
*  This airport, I was an airline pilot for 24 years. I've landed at that airport and on that runway many times. [[11:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42405.64s)]
*  I don't think that's a particularly challenging airport. You certainly have got to be on your toes. [[11:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42411.64s)]
*  It's a little different than most airports, but if you handle it right, it's not a problem at all. [[11:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42416.64s)]
*  Two sources confirmed to CBS News that one air traffic control worker was managing both the helicopters and the planes in the area. [[11:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42421.64s)]
*  That's usually monitored by two people. How serious and unusual would that be? [[11:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42428.64s)]
*  Well, I'm really concerned about that. The first accident that I went to is an NTSB board member. [[11:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42434.64s)]
*  We found that there was only one controller on duty. There were supposed to be two. [[11:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42439.64s)]
*  Supposedly if two controllers would have been there, the accident may not have occurred. [[11:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42443.64s)]
*  So I'm concerned about that. I want to know why this would be the case. [[11:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42448.64s)]
*  As former NTSB chair, what information can investigators glean from what they recover at the scene, particularly the black boxes, [[11:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42453.64s)]
*  the flight recorders, debris, even passenger cell phones? [[11:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42461.64s)]
*  Yeah, good question. A lot of people forget about the cell phones. There's some good information that the NTSB can recover from those. [[11:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42465.64s)]
*  The recorders are so important, especially the cockpit voice recorder, because it provides the most direct evidence of what was going on inside of that cockpit. [[11:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42471.64s)]
*  So even though they may be waterlogged, information can still be gleaned from them? [[11:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42481.64s)]
*  Absolutely. These recorders were only in less than 10 feet of water, so it's not a problem at all. [[11:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42485.64s)]
*  What information can be gleaned from passenger cell phones? [[11:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42491.64s)]
*  Well, in some cases, I've seen hot air balloon accidents where everybody's taking pictures because it's a joyous occasion. [[11:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42493.64s)]
*  Here it's night. I'm not sure that there would be a lot of personal cell phone photos going on at the time, but the board will certainly try and retrieve data from those. [[11:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42502.64s)]
*  I have to ask you something that's been on my mind since this happened, and I think it's probably on the mind of a lot of people. Is it safe to fly right now? [[11:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42513.64s)]
*  Absolutely, it's safe, and I want to put it in perspective, and I don't want to sound trite about the disaster that happened last night. [[11:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42521.64s)]
*  But we've gone 16 years without a fatal crash with a major airline, with an airline in this country, with a U.S. airline. [[11:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42528.64s)]
*  I think that says something right there, that there's a lot of safeguards in the system that have kept the system as accident-free as it has been. [[11:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42537.64s)]
*  Yes, there have been close calls, but there's multiple layers of defense that when one error is made, it's caught by another. [[11:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42545.64s)]
*  Obviously, last night, those layers of defense were breached. [[11:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42552.64s)]
*  Forgive me for being cynical, but one in 16 years, that seems prevalent to me. [[11:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42556.64s)]
*  As somebody who flies, as somebody whose loved ones fly, that makes me nervous. [[11:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42561.64s)]
*  And when you say it is safe to fly, but then we hear from the president and secretary of defense saying a mistake was made, something happened, and we need to get to the bottom of it. [[11:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42566.64s)]
*  How do you conflate those two? [[11:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42574.64s)]
*  Well, obviously, something did not go properly. I think to say that it's a mistake. [[11:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42576.64s)]
*  Let's let the data find out. Let's find out from the data what, if any, mistake was made. [[11:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42582.64s)]
*  But obviously, two airplanes are not supposed to end up at the same place at the same time. [[11:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42589.64s)]
*  Anything else you want to say? [[11:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42593.64s)]
*  No, our thoughts and prayers do go out for all of those victims, their families, and their friends. [[11:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42595.64s)]
*  It's a tragic day. Robert Sumwalt, thank you for your time. [[11:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42600.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[11:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8oKu3kRJQE&t=42603.64s)]
