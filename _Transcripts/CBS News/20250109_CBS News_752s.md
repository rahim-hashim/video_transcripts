# President Biden eulogizes former President Jimmy Carter
**CBS News:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY)
*  We are set now to hear from the President of the United States, Joe Biden, who just [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=0.0s)]
*  placed his hand on the casket, and Jen efflected, and now is set to remember his friend Jimmy [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=6.36s)]
*  Carter on this National Day of Mourning. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=15.36s)]
*  Leaders of the clergy, distinguished guests, most importantly, the Carter family. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=18.0s)]
*  In April 2021, Jill and I visited Jimmy and Rosalynn on a warm spring day down in Plains, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=27.12s)]
*  Georgia. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=39.08s)]
*  We wanted to see them. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=40.08s)]
*  Rosalynn met us at the front door with her signature smile. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=44.52s)]
*  Together we entered a home that they had shared for almost 77 years of marriage, none assuming [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=49.92s)]
*  Red Brick Ranch home, that reflects their modesty more than any trappings of power. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=57.16s)]
*  We walked in a living room where Jimmy greeted us like family. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=64.16s)]
*  That day, just the four of us sat in the living room and shared memories that spanned almost [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=71.0s)]
*  six decades. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=77.4s)]
*  A deep friendship that started in 1974. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=78.4s)]
*  I was a 31-year-old senator, and I was the first senator outside of Georgia, maybe the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=83.84s)]
*  first senator to endorse his candidacy for president. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=92.92s)]
*  It was an endorsement based on what I believe is Jimmy Carter's enduring attribute, character, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  character, character. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=108.0s)]
*  Because of that character, I believe it is destiny, destiny in our lives, and quite frankly, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=112.28s)]
*  destiny in the life of the nation. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=121.64s)]
*  It's an accumulation of a million things built on character that leads to a good life [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  in a decent country. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=131.84s)]
*  Life of purpose, life of meaning. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=134.52s)]
*  Now how do we find that good life? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=138.92s)]
*  What does it look like? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  What does it take to build character? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=146.28s)]
*  Do the ends justify the means? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=151.32s)]
*  Jimmy Carter's friendship taught me, and through his life taught me, the strength of character [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  is more than title or the power we hold. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=163.84s)]
*  It's the strength to understand that everyone should be treated with dignity, respect, that [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=170.4s)]
*  everyone, and I mean everyone, deserves an even shot. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=177.48s)]
*  Not a guarantee, but just a shot. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=182.24s)]
*  You know, we have an obligation to give hate no safe harbor. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=186.2s)]
*  And to stand up to what my dad just said is the greatest sin of all, the abuse of power. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  That's not about being perfect, because none of us are perfect. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=203.28s)]
*  We're all fallible. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  But it's about asking ourselves, are we striving to do things, the right things? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=209.6s)]
*  What values, what are the values that animate our spirit? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=216.48s)]
*  Do we operate from fear or hope? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=220.68s)]
*  Ego or generosity? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=225.4s)]
*  Do we show grace? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=228.0s)]
*  Do we keep the faith when it's most tested? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=230.72s)]
*  But keeping the faith with the best of humankind and the best of America is a story, in my [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=236.48s)]
*  view, from my perspective, of Jimmy Carter's life. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=244.92s)]
*  The story of a man, to state the obvious, you've heard today from the great, great eulogies, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=248.0s)]
*  who came from a house without running water or electricity, and rose as a pinnacle of [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=256.2s)]
*  power. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=265.44s)]
*  The story of a man who was at once driven and devoted to making real the words of his [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=266.44s)]
*  savior and the ideals of this nation. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=274.8s)]
*  The story of a man who never let the tides of politics divert him from his mission to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=278.88s)]
*  serve and shape the world. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=287.36s)]
*  The man had character. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=291.52s)]
*  Jimmy held a deep Christian faith in God and that his candidacy spoke and wrote about faith [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=295.6s)]
*  as a substance of things hoped for and evidence of the things not seen. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=306.52000000000004s)]
*  Faith founded on commandments of scripture. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy mind and all thy soul and love [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=320.4s)]
*  thy neighbor as thyself. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=327.12s)]
*  Easy to say, but very, very difficult to do. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=331.12s)]
*  In his life, in this life, any walk of faith can be difficult. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  It can be lonely, but it requires action to be the doers of the world. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=343.2s)]
*  But in that commandment lies the essence, in my view, found in the gospel, found in [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=351.11999999999995s)]
*  many faith traditions, and found in the very idea of America. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=356.91999999999996s)]
*  Because the very journey of our nation is a walk of sheer faith. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=362.59999999999997s)]
*  To do the work, to be the country we say we are, to be the country we say we want to be. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=370.92s)]
*  A nation where we all are created equal in the image of God and deserved to be treated [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=378.32s)]
*  equally throughout our lives. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=385.04s)]
*  We've never fully lived up to that idea of America. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  We've never walked away from it either because of patriots like Jimmy Carter. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=392.56s)]
*  Throughout his life, he showed us what it means to be a practitioner of good works and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=400.12s)]
*  a good and faithful servant of God and of the people. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=407.16s)]
*  And today, many think he was from a bygone era. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=411.56s)]
*  But in reality, he saw a well into the future. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=418.56s)]
*  A white Southern Baptist who led on civil rights. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=424.32s)]
*  A decorated Navy veteran who brokered peace. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=430.32s)]
*  A brilliant nuclear engineer who led on nuclear nonproliferation. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=435.32s)]
*  A hardworking farmer who championed conservation and clean energy. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=442.32s)]
*  And a president who redefined the relationship with the vice president. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=448.32s)]
*  Jimmy and I often talked about our dear friend, Walter Mondale, whom we all miss very much. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=456.32s)]
*  Together, they formed a model partnership of collaboration and trust because both were men of character. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=463.32s)]
*  As you all know, Jimmy Carter also established a model post presidency by making a powerful [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=474.32s)]
*  difference as a private citizen in America and, I might add, as you all know, around the world. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=482.8s)]
*  Through it all, he showed us how character and faith start with ourselves and then flows to others. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=491.32s)]
*  At our best, we share the better parts of ourselves. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=500.32s)]
*  Joy, solidarity, love, commitment. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=505.32s)]
*  Not for reward, but in reverence for the incredible gift of life we've all been granted. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=511.32s)]
*  To make every minute of our time here on Earth count. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=521.3199999999999s)]
*  That's the definition of a good life. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=526.32s)]
*  A life Jimmy Carter lived during his 100 years. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=530.32s)]
*  To young people, to anyone in search of meaning and purpose, study the power of Jimmy Carter's example. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=536.32s)]
*  I miss him, but I take solace in knowing that he and his beloved Rosalynn are reunited again. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=548.32s)]
*  To the entire Carter family, thank you, and I mean this sincerely, for sharing them both with America and the world. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=558.32s)]
*  We love you all. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=571.32s)]
*  Jill and I will cherish our visits with them, including that last one in their home. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=574.32s)]
*  We saw Jimmy as he always was, at peace with a life fully lived. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=581.32s)]
*  A good life, a purpose and meaning, of character driven by destiny. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=588.32s)]
*  And filled with the power of faith, hope, and love. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=598.32s)]
*  Say it again, faith, hope, and love. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=604.32s)]
*  As he returned to Plains, Georgia for his final resting place, we could say goodbye in the words of the prophet Micah, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=609.32s)]
*  who Jimmy so admired until his final breath. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=619.32s)]
*  Jimmy Carter did justly, loved mercy, walked humbly. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=624.32s)]
*  May God bless a great American and a dear friend and a good man. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=633.32s)]
*  May he rise up, be raised up on eagle's wings, and bear you on the breath of dawn, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=638.32s)]
*  and make you to shine like the sun, and hold you in the palm of his hand. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=645.32s)]
*  God bless you, Jimmy Carter. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=653.32s)]
*  And President Biden describing his lifelong friendship with Jimmy Carter, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=663.32s)]
*  beginning when he was a newly elected senator and being one of the first to endorse Jimmy Carter for president, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=668.32s)]
*  and making this eulogy much but a larger statement about character. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=675.32s)]
*  A devout Roman Catholic eulogizing a devout evangelical Christian, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=680.32s)]
*  president from the small city of Scranton, Pennsylvania, talking about a man from Plains. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=686.32s)]
*  Two lives interwoven in terms of their politics, their sense of character and mission. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=692.32s)]
*  Joe Biden has delivered so many eulogies in his time, and he always ends so prophetically. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=700.32s)]
*  And it is one of the great traits of Joe Biden is that he does not miss attending. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=707.32s)]
*  He's the president of the United States. Of course, he was going to be there. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=713.32s)]
*  But he does care so deeply about people and making sure to eulogize them. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=715.32s)]
*  He does. And I think it means so much to him or meant when his first wife died in the auto crash [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=718.32s)]
*  and that incredible tragedy and people like Richard Nixon, then president, reached out to Joe Biden. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=726.32s)]
*  And Jimmy Carter, when they connected Biden and Carter at a J.C.'s meeting in Atlanta, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=733.32s)]
*  were able to talk and commiserate about pain and sorrow. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=739.32s)]
*  And so they humanized their relationship in the 1970s, and it's continued until Carter died. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xszkTKZbY&t=744.32s)]
