# Trump said meeting with U.K.'s Starmer was productive on Ukraine, trade deal
**CBS News:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E)
*  Hello and thank you for joining us. President Trump welcomed UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=0.0s)]
*  to the White House Thursday. The two leaders discussed the strong ties between nations, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=4.32s)]
*  trade and NATO. Of course, one of the most pressing topics was Ukraine. Starmer said he [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  is willing to send peacekeeping troops as part of a future peace deal. The president and prime [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=14.32s)]
*  minister addressed that at a joint news conference. The next step we're making is toward a very [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=19.2s)]
*  achievable ceasefire. We hope that that can happen quickly because thousands of young people, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=26.159999999999997s)]
*  in this case, we're not talking about Americans, we're talking about Ukrainians and Russians are [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=34.56s)]
*  being killed every week. The UK is ready to put boots on the ground and planes in the air to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=38.72s)]
*  support a deal working together with our allies because that is the only way that peace will last. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  President Trump also made an announcement Thursday about his proposed 25 percent tariffs on goods [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=51.68s)]
*  from Canada and Mexico. He wrote on Truth Social, quote, drugs are still pouring into our country [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=56.32s)]
*  from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels. A large percentage of these drugs, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  much of them in the form of fentanyl, are made in and supplied by China. He later adds, until it [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=66.48s)]
*  stops or is seriously limited, the proposed tariffs scheduled to go into effect on March 4th will [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=71.44s)]
*  on March 4th will indeed go into effect as scheduled. China will likewise be charged [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=76.64s)]
*  an additional 10 percent tariff on that date. Despite President Trump raising concerns about [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=82.16s)]
*  fentanyl from both countries, more than 96 percent of fentanyl seized by border officials last year [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=87.12s)]
*  came from the southern border compared to just 0.2 percent from the north, according to data from [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=92.08s)]
*  Customs and Border Protection. CBS News White House reporter Aaron Navarro joins us now. Aaron, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=96.48s)]
*  what were big takeaways from Prime Minister Stahmer's visit to the White House? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=101.2s)]
*  Yeah, you mentioned that Ukraine and Russia were central in their discussions. I thought it was [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=105.36s)]
*  notable during the presser between the two leaders how Trump said that a ceasefire specifically was [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=109.44000000000001s)]
*  acceptable. He sounded very optimistic on that. As you mentioned, the British prime minister [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  committed to putting peacekeepers in Ukraine if a deal is reached, while President Trump, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=119.44000000000001s)]
*  as he has throughout this whole week, said that he would not commit to that and that he wants to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=124.0s)]
*  get the deal done first. And then when asked if the prime minister was able to convince Trump [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=128.0s)]
*  that tariffs are not necessary in terms of U.S. tariffs on the United Kingdom, Trump said that the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=133.6s)]
*  discussion between the two leaders was productive and there could be a trade deal between the two [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=139.28s)]
*  allies where tariffs are not necessary. That's one of the first exceptions we've heard from [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=143.92s)]
*  President Trump when it comes to his overall tariff war. Another remarkable moment happened [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=147.6s)]
*  during the Oval Office in the meeting when President Trump was asked about his relationship with [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=152.16s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the minerals deal they're expected to sign. Let's [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=156.0s)]
*  watch. I think I have a very good relationship with President Zelensky and now we're, you know, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=160.56s)]
*  we're doing the deal. Did I say that? I can't believe I said that. Next question. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=166.4s)]
*  I mean, Zelensky arrives at the White House Friday. What do you make of that and what can we expect [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=177.84s)]
*  from this visit? It's a striking shift on just February 19. That's when President Trump called [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=181.6s)]
*  Ukrainian President Zelensky a dictator and called for elections to potentially replace him. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=187.12s)]
*  Now today he says he has, quote, a lot of respect for the Ukrainian president and says that Ukrainian [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=192.32s)]
*  forces have fought very bravely. The expectation is that there will be an agreement between the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=197.12s)]
*  two countries for the U.S. to have a stake in the amount of rare earth minerals in Ukraine. This is [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=201.6s)]
*  a material used for smartphones, other electronics. Trump referred to it as a, quote, huge economic [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=206.8s)]
*  development project for Ukraine, but it could also be helpful for the U.S. and Trump sees it as a [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=212.24s)]
*  sort of return of investment for aid given to Ukraine during President Biden's term. One expert [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=217.28s)]
*  we had last night on TDR said it could take a decade for us to see any of these rare minerals. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=223.12s)]
*  The president was asked about that today. He didn't exactly take that bait but said we're going to dig [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=227.52s)]
*  and you never know what you're going to find. Right. Before we let you go, President Trump says [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico will go into effect Tuesday. We mentioned how the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=235.12s)]
*  vast majority of fentanyl is seized from the southern border. Less than a percent comes from [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=240.24s)]
*  the north. How does the White House justify equal tariffs for both? Yeah, that's right. Just in the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=244.0s)]
*  northern border, just a small amount, one percent of the fentanyl supply is from smuggling across [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=248.8s)]
*  Canada, according to the Canadian prime minister. Our colleague Nancy Cordes asked President Trump [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=254.96s)]
*  about that disparity and in response, Trump suggested that there is fentanyl that is not [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=260.08s)]
*  being caught in that northern border and said that the country should, quote, be apprehending more. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=264.48s)]
*  Erin Navarro, thank you. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuewbv4695E&t=269.76s)]
