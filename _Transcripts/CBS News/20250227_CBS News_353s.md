# Former U.S. ambassador to Poland examines state of Russia-Ukraine peace talks
**CBS News:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo)
*  Welcome back. President Trump and UK Prime Minister Starmor discussed their efforts to bring the war in Ukraine to an end today at the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=0.0s)]
*  We're working very hard to get that war brought to an end. I think we've made a lot of progress and I think it's moving along pretty rapidly. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=8.0s)]
*  We've discussed a plan today to reach a peace that is tough and fair. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=16.0s)]
*  The UK is ready to put boots on the ground and planes in the air to support a deal, working together with our allies, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=21.0s)]
*  because that is the only way that peace will last. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=29.0s)]
*  Daniel Freed joins me now here at the table to discuss this and a lot more. He's formerly served as the US ambassador to Poland. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=33.0s)]
*  Dan, it's great to see you. Thanks for joining us. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=39.0s)]
*  The British Prime Minister Keir Starmor also said that whatever the contours of the peace arrangement are, they cannot reward the aggressor. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=41.0s)]
*  They cannot reward the invader. Words that President Trump so far has not used to describe this conflict or Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=49.0s)]
*  Do you detect in that any distance, any significant strategic difference between the UK and the United States? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=58.0s)]
*  Within the four corners of Trump's plan to end the war, you could come out with a good deal. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=65.0s)]
*  Now, the US has stumbled over its own message this week. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=73.0s)]
*  That weak UN General Assembly resolution and the inability of President Trump's people, even before Congress, to say who the invader is. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=77.0s)]
*  Hint, it's Russia. Everybody knows it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=87.0s)]
*  But you could still see a decent outcome. Ceasefire in place and Ukrainian security. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=91.0s)]
*  President Trump has gotten the British and French to agree in principle to put up forces. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=100.0s)]
*  That's a very big deal without deployed US forces. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=106.0s)]
*  Trump ought to take the win. The British and French would be fools, frankly, to go into Ukraine without some American backup. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=110.0s)]
*  The Americans have said no troops on the ground. OK, that means backup in the air, logistics, intelligence. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=118.0s)]
*  That sounds like a package that could work. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=125.0s)]
*  Now, Putin won't accept it. That's a whole other deal. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=128.0s)]
*  But first we have to come up with a strong package to make it to make a peace sustainable. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=131.0s)]
*  And in the conversations in public today and earlier this week in the contours of this yet to be signed, but we're expected to be signed tomorrow, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=138.0s)]
*  US and Ukraine in agreement about US access to rare earth minerals in Ukraine. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=145.0s)]
*  The president said that's a security guarantee for Ukraine by itself because we'll be there. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=150.0s)]
*  We'll be on the ground digging, mining, and no one's going to attack Ukraine if we're there. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=156.0s)]
*  Is that credible, plausible? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=162.0s)]
*  It's a contribution to Ukrainian security. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=166.0s)]
*  And if you read the deal, it's kind of a sketch rather than a full deal. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=169.0s)]
*  But it's a plus. I think the Ukrainians are right to sign it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=173.0s)]
*  But it doesn't substitute for real security. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=177.0s)]
*  The president's exaggerating the impact. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=180.0s)]
*  Do you think Putin is going to worry about going after Ukraine if there are some US engineers and business people on the ground? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=183.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=191.0s)]
*  You mean and by yeah, you mean no. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=193.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=196.0s)]
*  We need more serious security backing for Ukraine. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=198.0s)]
*  There's a plan on the table which would be a real win for Trump. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=203.0s)]
*  He's called for the Europeans to step up to do more to defend themselves. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=207.0s)]
*  Now the Europeans are planning to do it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=211.0s)]
*  That's why Trump should take the win. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=213.0s)]
*  Speaking of that language stepping up, Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, gave voice to some of that at the White House today. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=216.0s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=221.0s)]
*  Mr. President, in this new era, you're also right that Europe must step up. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=223.0s)]
*  This year, we'll be giving more military aid to Ukraine than ever. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=229.0s)]
*  And just this week, I've set out how we're shouldering more of the security burden. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=233.0s)]
*  We're already one of the biggest spenders in NATO. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=238.0s)]
*  And now we're going much further. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=241.0s)]
*  This is a reflection of the Trump effect. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=244.0s)]
*  It's sometimes hostile. It's sometimes very sharp elbowed. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=247.0s)]
*  It's not diplomatic in a traditional sense. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=251.0s)]
*  But in this context, Dan, it appears to have gotten some results. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=254.0s)]
*  Trump is getting traction for his ideas. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=257.0s)]
*  He's getting the Europeans to do something that three, four months ago seemed far-fetched. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=261.0s)]
*  And the Biden administration was not vocally demanding. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=267.0s)]
*  Well, Trump could succeed and more power to him if he does. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=270.0s)]
*  But he needs to close the deal. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=275.0s)]
*  And that means backing up the Europeans. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=277.0s)]
*  It means staring down Vladimir Putin because once we have a plan, Putin's going to say no. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=279.0s)]
*  You realize that. I think everybody does. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=286.0s)]
*  And more to that point, Dan, when the president was asked today, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=289.0s)]
*  do you expect Vladimir Putin, if there is an agreement reached, to live up to his obligations, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=292.0s)]
*  he said, sure, I think he will. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=297.0s)]
*  Does that sound to you in any way harmfully naive? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=299.0s)]
*  Well, it could be harmfully naive, although one of the better people in Trump world [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=303.0s)]
*  immediately remarked that it's Trump's way of warning Putin not to mess around. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=308.0s)]
*  Now, could be either one. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=312.0s)]
*  But it's important that the administration stop giving Putin gifts, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=314.0s)]
*  like refusing to say that it was a Russian invasion [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=319.0s)]
*  and supporting weak U.N. resolutions that have us side with the world's dictators [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=322.0s)]
*  and our foes rather than our friends. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=328.0s)]
*  But still, for all the criticisms, and it's been a pretty rough week, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=330.0s)]
*  you could still end up with a decent enough American-European plan to back Ukrainian security. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=336.0s)]
*  Trump likes to win. This could be a win. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=343.0s)]
*  But we face some tests ahead. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=346.0s)]
*  Dan Fried, it's been a pleasure, sir. Thanks so much for coming in. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=349.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIAWnOegWeo&t=351.0s)]
