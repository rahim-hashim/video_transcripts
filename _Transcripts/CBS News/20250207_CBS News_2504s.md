# Trump holds press conference with Japan's Ishiba | Special Report
**CBS News:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI)
*  This is a CBS News special report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm John Dickerson at CBS News headquarters in New York. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2.2s)]
*  Good day. President Trump has been meeting [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=6.4s)]
*  at the White House with the Japanese prime minister. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=8.94s)]
*  Let's listen to him now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=10.88s)]
*  Okay, thank you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=12.48s)]
*  Oh. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=22.48s)]
*  Remember that day. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=28.48s)]
*  Thank you very much everybody. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=32.88s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  I'm delighted to welcome Japanese prime minister Ishiba Shigeru to the White House for the first time. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=38.08s)]
*  Prime Minister, it's an honor to have you with us. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=45.28s)]
*  A great honor. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=48.08s)]
*  Japan is a great country. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=50.68s)]
*  Japan is strong and proud. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=53.08s)]
*  It's a nation that is home to one of the great civilizations in the history of the world. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=54.28s)]
*  For nearly 80 years, the American Japanese people have enjoyed a friendship like few others. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=59.379999999999995s)]
*  We've had a great friendship across the vast ocean and found ourselves united by bonds of history, commerce, culture, mutual admiration and great respect. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=65.28s)]
*  After our meeting today, I'm confident that the cherished alliances between our two countries and others also will continue to flourish long and into the future. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=78.08s)]
*  The military cooperation between the United States and Japan is one of our closest security partnerships. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=90.38s)]
*  And it's one of the closest we have anywhere in the world. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=96.98s)]
*  Our service members work together every day to defend our common interests. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=100.78s)]
*  Japan is committed to double its defense spending by 2027 compared to my first term. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=105.78s)]
*  They've invested a lot of money because of my first term. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=112.48s)]
*  We worked on that very hard with Shinzo. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=116.18s)]
*  You know, the great Shinzo Abe. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=118.88s)]
*  And we look forward to seeing even more so. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=122.28s)]
*  Shinzo and I worked very, very long and hard and those numbers are very reflective after my first term. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=126.08s)]
*  And now they're going up very substantially based on our conversations today. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=133.78s)]
*  In addition to being vital for our shared security, Japan is one of the top purchases of US military exports and equipment. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=138.38s)]
*  And I'm pleased to say that this week my administration approved nearly a billion dollars in foreign military sales to Tokyo. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=146.68s)]
*  The United States is totally committed to the security of Japan. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=155.68s)]
*  We will extend the full strength of American deterrence capabilities in defense of our friend and ally. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  Hundred percent. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  In the years to come, the prime minister and I will be working closely together to maintain peace and security. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=169.38s)]
*  And I also say peace through strength and all over the Indo-Pacific. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=175.68s)]
*  And to that end, we also remain committed to the effort I began in my first term to ensure safety and stability on the Korean Peninsula. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=180.18s)]
*  Prime Minister Isha Ba and I spoke long and hard about a vital economic relationship between our two countries and the continuance of that relationship. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=190.38s)]
*  The United States and Japan trade over 300 billion dollars in goods and services each year. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=202.08s)]
*  Japan has invested nearly 800 billion dollars and that's going to go up very, very substantially in the coming months, more than any other country. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  And they're going to have some competition. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=217.58s)]
*  We have a lot of people coming in and investing in the United States. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=220.18s)]
*  I think our our the feeling throughout the world has never been stronger about this country. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=222.98000000000002s)]
*  As a result of our victory in 2024, the presidential election, the Japanese investment and technology giant Softbank announced plans to invest between 100 and 200 billion dollars. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=229.78s)]
*  We have many other companies investing that number higher than that number, some a little bit less. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=241.98000000000002s)]
*  But we have trillions of dollars of investment pouring into our country now that you didn't have just a short while ago. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=248.18s)]
*  Today, our teams discussed how our two nations can do even more to stay on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence along with the quantum computing semiconductors and other critical technologies. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=255.28s)]
*  And they're coming out. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  The problem with technology that kind, it's obsolete in about two days. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=270.48s)]
*  So we have to start all over again. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=274.08s)]
*  Doesn't last long. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=276.18s)]
*  We agreed to cooperate even more closely to combat the Chinese economic aggression, which is quite aggressive. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm also pleased to announce that Japan will soon begin importing historic new shipments of clean American liquefied natural gas in record numbers. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=285.08s)]
*  It'll be record numbers with our. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=294.58s)]
*  Secretary of the interior. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=298.68s)]
*  We were talking. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  I think Doug is here. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=301.28s)]
*  Hello, Doug. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=302.38s)]
*  Please stand up to Doug Bergham, everybody. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=303.18s)]
*  We're talking about the pipeline in Alaska, which is the closest point of major oil and gas to Japan by far. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=307.38s)]
*  Now, less than half the distance of any other location. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=316.38s)]
*  We're talking about a joint venture of some type between Japan and us having to do with Alaska oil and gas. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=319.58s)]
*  And that's very exciting. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=326.88s)]
*  They're very excited about it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=328.18s)]
*  As we deepen our economic relationship, I made clear that the United States will be conducting trade with all countries based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=330.38s)]
*  Chronic trade deficits not only undermine our economy, they really do. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=340.98s)]
*  And we're going to get rid of the trade. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=347.08s)]
*  We have a trade deficit with Japan of over a hundred billion dollars, but we're going to work that out. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=348.98s)]
*  And I think very quickly, frankly, we can do it just on oil and gas. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=353.68s)]
*  We can work it out. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=357.98s)]
*  So we intend to do it very quickly. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=358.98s)]
*  We both understand that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=361.58000000000004s)]
*  And as America welcomes new foreign investment, we also want to ensure that companies build their products and factories here in America, not simply by the assets that we have. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=363.38s)]
*  And Japan is going to be opening up auto plants. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=375.78000000000003s)]
*  New auto plants are being built currently as we as we speak. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=379.68s)]
*  They've just been started. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=382.78000000000003s)]
*  Toyota is one and Nissan is going to be doing something very exciting about about US Steel. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=384.78000000000003s)]
*  They'll be looking at an investment rather than a purchase. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=392.48s)]
*  We didn't like the idea. US Steel is a very important company to us. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=395.18s)]
*  It was the greatest company in the world for 15 years, many years ago, 80 years ago. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=400.28000000000003s)]
*  And we didn't want to see that leave. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=405.48s)]
*  And it wouldn't actually leave. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=409.18s)]
*  But the concept, psychologically, not good. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=410.68s)]
*  So they've agreed to invest heavily in US Steel as opposed to own it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=414.08s)]
*  And that sounds very exciting. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=419.47999999999996s)]
*  And we're going to meet with Nissan next week. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=420.97999999999996s)]
*  The head of Nissan, very great company. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=423.88s)]
*  And they'll work out the details. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=425.68s)]
*  I'll help. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=427.97999999999996s)]
*  I'll be there to to mediate and arbitrate. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=428.47999999999996s)]
*  Then I had the privilege of working closely with the great prime minister, as you know, and you know him very well. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=432.38s)]
*  Shinzo Abe, the longest serving prime minister in Japan's history. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=437.68s)]
*  Likewise, I expect that this prime minister is going to be a great one. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=442.88s)]
*  I really believe that he's going to be a great one. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=447.28s)]
*  I've gotten to know him for not long, but I can see what they have. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=449.18s)]
*  He's got he's got he's got the qualities of greatness. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=454.38s)]
*  He's going to do a fantastic job for Japan and for the Japanese people. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=458.08s)]
*  And I'd like now to invite the prime minister to say a few words and then we'll take some questions. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=463.08s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, thank you. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=468.68s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=470.98s)]
*  Mr. President Trump, I would like to sincerely thank you for inviting me to the White House today, immediately following your inauguration. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=476.98s)]
*  I also thank you for your very warm hospitality. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=487.38s)]
*  I have come to Washington, D.C., with the hope of having a face-to-face meeting and deepening our mutual understanding at this early date [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=492.38s)]
*  with President Trump, who is now leading the United States, the most important country for Japan's diplomacy and security, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=503.97999999999996s)]
*  and aligning our perspectives and visions that Japan and the United States should pursue. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=513.68s)]
*  What should we do to advance the national interests of both of our countries in synergy and to realize peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=521.6800000000001s)]
*  I am convinced that the answer lies in further strengthening the strong and unwavering Japan-U.S. alliance to achieve a free and open Indo-Pacific. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=533.6800000000001s)]
*  President and I concurred to strengthen the deterrence and response capabilities of the alliance and to work closely in addressing strategic challenges [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=548.08s)]
*  that both countries are facing in this region. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=559.88s)]
*  I conveyed to the president that Japan, as an ally of the United States, is ready to share responsibilities and to play its own role. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=562.88s)]
*  I also reiterated Japan's unwavering commitment to fundamentally reinforcing its defense capabilities, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=573.48s)]
*  and reconfirmed the unwavering commitment by the United States to the defense of Japan. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=582.48s)]
*  We reaffirmed that Article 5 of the Japan-U.S. Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=589.48s)]
*  applies to the Senkaku Islands. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=596.98s)]
*  With half of the world's population and approximately 60 percent of the world's GDP, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=600.68s)]
*  the Indo-Pacific serves as the engine of growth and vitality for Japan, the United States and the world. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=608.18s)]
*  President and I also concurred that the United States and Japan will make further efforts in a wide range of areas [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=616.18s)]
*  working hand-in-hand together to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=624.4799999999999s)]
*  In this context, we also concurred to further advance cooperation of the multilayered networks of the like-minded countries, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=629.4799999999999s)]
*  including the Quad and Trilateral Cooperation with the Republic of Korea and the Philippines. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=639.4799999999999s)]
*  We also discussed Japan-United States cooperation to bring about growth and prosperity, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=645.4799999999999s)]
*  and Japan's economic cooperation, including on economic security, is important from the perspective of strengthening alliance cooperation. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=652.78s)]
*  Japan is the closest economic partner of the United States and has been the world's largest investor in the United States for five consecutive years. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=660.78s)]
*  Also, with the inauguration of President Trump, the momentum for Japanese companies to invest in the United States is growing even stronger. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=675.0799999999999s)]
*  Today, I conveyed my willingness to cooperate together to elevate Japan's investment in the United States to an unprecedented amount of $1 trillion. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=685.0799999999999s)]
*  President Trump and I also concurred to elevate the Japan-U.S. partnership to an even higher level through improving business environment [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=699.38s)]
*  and increasing bilateral investment and employment, strengthening each other's industries, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=711.38s)]
*  leading the world in developing advanced technologies such as AI and leading edge semiconductors, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=717.38s)]
*  and strongly promoting efforts to harness the energy of the growing market in the Indo-Pacific region. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=725.68s)]
*  We also confirmed that we will cooperate to strengthen energy security between the two countries, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=737.68s)]
*  including increasing exports of the United States' liquefied natural gas to Japan in a mutually beneficial manner [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=745.68s)]
*  Regarding foreign exchange, as in the first Trump administration, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=753.9799999999999s)]
*  close discussions will continue between Japanese and the U.S. finance ministers who are experts in this field. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=758.9799999999999s)]
*  We also held candid discussions on challenges the Indo-Pacific region is facing. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=766.9799999999999s)]
*  We confirmed that we are resolved not to allow unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=771.9799999999999s)]
*  and to oppose such attempts in the East and South China Seas in order to fully defend a free and open Indo-Pacific. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=778.28s)]
*  We also reiterated the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=790.28s)]
*  Regarding North Korea, we affirmed the need to address its nuclear and missile program, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=797.28s)]
*  which poses a serious threat to Japan, the U.S., and beyond, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=802.5799999999999s)]
*  and that Japan and the U.S. will work together toward the complete denuclearization of North Korea. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=807.5799999999999s)]
*  As the abductees and their families continue to age, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=814.5799999999999s)]
*  I conveyed my strong sense of urgency and determination directly to President Trump [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=818.5799999999999s)]
*  and gained his renewed strong support for the immediate resolution of the abductions issue. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=823.5799999999999s)]
*  While this was my first face-to-face meeting with President Trump, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=829.88s)]
*  we were able to openly and frankly exchange views, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=834.88s)]
*  and our meeting turned out to be very productive and meaningful. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=839.88s)]
*  As a result of today's meeting, which marked a new departure for the Japan-U.S. relations, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=848.88s)]
*  we are issuing a Japan-U.S. Joint Leader Agreement on the Abduction of the Japanese-U.S. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=853.88s)]
*  a Japan-U.S. Joint Leader Statement. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=858.18s)]
*  This document will serve as a compass for further cooperation between our two countries. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=862.18s)]
*  On the basis of these deliverables, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=869.18s)]
*  I look forward to working together with President Trump, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=872.18s)]
*  who I respect immensely, to usher in a new golden age of Japan-U.S. relations. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=875.18s)]
*  I look forward to welcoming you to Japan. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=884.18s)]
*  And I am very excited about that prospect. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=888.18s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=891.18s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=893.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=895.18s)]
*  Any questions, please? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=899.18s)]
*  Peter? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=901.18s)]
*  President Trump, I have two on Joe. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=902.18s)]
*  Elon Musk said today, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=905.18s)]
*  I love Donald Trump as much as a straight man can love another man. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=907.18s)]
*  What does the First Lady think about that? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=912.18s)]
*  I think she'll be okay with it somehow. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=915.4799999999999s)]
*  So, Democratic lawmakers are really upset [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=919.4799999999999s)]
*  that those engineers have access to these credit-revenue systems [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=922.4799999999999s)]
*  that have Senate intel, cash, or other systems. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=929.4799999999999s)]
*  They're ashamed of these systems. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=932.4799999999999s)]
*  They're used to disburse trillions of dollars each year [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=934.4799999999999s)]
*  and contain everyday Americans' personal information [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=937.4799999999999s)]
*  like social security numbers, home addresses, bank accounts. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=939.4799999999999s)]
*  Why does Joe need all of that? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=943.48s)]
*  There's nothing of value to anybody [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=973.78s)]
*  unless there's a kickback scheme going on, which is possible. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=977.78s)]
*  And we're going to be doing more and more of that. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=981.78s)]
*  We're going to be looking at Department of Education. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=983.78s)]
*  We're going to be looking at even our military. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=985.78s)]
*  We're going to be looking at tremendous amounts of money, Peter, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=987.78s)]
*  being spent on things that bear no relationship [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=990.78s)]
*  to anything and have no value. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=994.78s)]
*  We're talking about trillions of dollars. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=996.78s)]
*  It will be, in the end, trillions of dollars [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=998.78s)]
*  being absolutely wasted and perhaps illegally, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1001.0799999999999s)]
*  I would say certainly in many cases illegally, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1005.0799999999999s)]
*  but perhaps illegally overall. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1007.0799999999999s)]
*  And I'm very proud of the job that this group of young people, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1009.0799999999999s)]
*  generally young people, but very smart people, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1014.0799999999999s)]
*  they're doing. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1016.0799999999999s)]
*  They're doing it, at my insistence. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1018.0799999999999s)]
*  It would be a lot easier not to do it, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1020.0799999999999s)]
*  but we have to take some of these things apart [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1022.0799999999999s)]
*  to find the corruption. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1024.08s)]
*  We found tremendous corruption. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1026.08s)]
*  How many young people are there in the department [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1030.78s)]
*  that are trying to get into the department of education [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1032.78s)]
*  earlier today? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1034.78s)]
*  Oh, I see the same ones. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1036.78s)]
*  I see Maxine Waters, Alola. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1038.78s)]
*  I see, you know, all these people. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1040.78s)]
*  They don't love our country. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1042.78s)]
*  They don't love our country. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1044.78s)]
*  We want great education. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1046.78s)]
*  So they rank 40 countries in education. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1048.78s)]
*  We're ranked dead last. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1050.78s)]
*  Dead last. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1052.78s)]
*  But the good news is we're number one in one category. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1054.78s)]
*  You know what that is? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1056.78s)]
*  And on any other country in the world, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1058.78s)]
*  you look at Norway, Denmark, Sweden, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1060.78s)]
*  various countries all up and down, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1062.78s)]
*  Finland, China does very well in education, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1064.78s)]
*  and then you look at us. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1068.78s)]
*  We spend much more money than they do per pupil [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1070.78s)]
*  or any other way, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1072.78s)]
*  but we spend much more money than they do, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1074.78s)]
*  and yet we're ranked this year, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1076.78s)]
*  Biden's last year, congratulations, Joe, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1078.78s)]
*  we're ranked dead last. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1081.78s)]
*  So what I want to see is education. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1083.78s)]
*  Number one, I like choice. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1085.78s)]
*  We all like choice. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1087.78s)]
*  But beyond choice, long beyond choice, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1089.78s)]
*  I want to see it go back to the states [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1091.78s)]
*  where great states that do so well [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1093.78s)]
*  have no debt, they're operated brilliantly. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1095.78s)]
*  They'll be as good as Norway or Denmark [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1097.78s)]
*  or Sweden or any of the other [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1099.78s)]
*  highly ranked countries. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1101.78s)]
*  They'll be, you'll probably have 30, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1103.78s)]
*  I figure 35 to 38 states will be right at the top, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1105.78s)]
*  and the rest will come along. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1107.78s)]
*  They'll have to come along competitively. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1109.78s)]
*  And by the way, we'll be spending a lot less money, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1111.78s)]
*  and we'll have great education. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1113.78s)]
*  As part of this Doge toss cup and cutting effort, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1115.78s)]
*  one of the Doge engineers was fired [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1118.78s)]
*  for some inappropriate posts. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1120.78s)]
*  The vice president says, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1122.78s)]
*  bring him back. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1124.78s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1125.78s)]
*  Well, I don't know about the particular thing, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1126.78s)]
*  but if the vice president said that, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1128.78s)]
*  did you say that? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1130.78s)]
*  I'm with the vice president. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1131.78s)]
*  Thank you, Peter. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1133.78s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead, please. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1135.78s)]
*  Yes, red dress. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1137.78s)]
*  Thank you so much, Mr. President. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1139.78s)]
*  Just how strong do you want [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1141.78s)]
*  Japan's military to be? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1144.78s)]
*  And do you specifically hope [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1146.78s)]
*  that their increased military spending [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1148.78s)]
*  will deter China and North Korea? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1150.78s)]
*  What did you talk about that today? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1152.78s)]
*  Well, I want our military to be the strongest. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1154.78s)]
*  I also don't mind spending so much money [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1157.78s)]
*  on the military because we build it here. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1160.78s)]
*  It's made in the USA, all made in the USA. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1162.78s)]
*  We have, you know, I rebuilt our military [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1164.78s)]
*  during my first term. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1167.78s)]
*  Did a great job. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1169.78s)]
*  We left some of it behind in Afghanistan, stupidly. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1171.78s)]
*  There was no reason for that, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1173.78s)]
*  but it was still as much as it was. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1175.78s)]
*  It was billions and billions of dollars, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1177.78s)]
*  but it was a small part of it. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1179.78s)]
*  But we're going to have the strongest military by far. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1181.78s)]
*  We have great people. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1184.78s)]
*  I want to congratulate Pete Hegseth [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1186.78s)]
*  for having gone through the gauntlet. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1188.78s)]
*  He went through a lot, but he got through, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1190.78s)]
*  and he's going to be a tremendous, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1192.78s)]
*  I have no doubt he's going to be a tremendous leader. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1194.78s)]
*  And other of the leaders sitting here, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1196.78s)]
*  they're in their own fields. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1198.78s)]
*  They're going to, they're going to do something [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1200.78s)]
*  very, very great, and we expect great things. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1202.78s)]
*  But I expect the strongest military by far in the world, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1204.78s)]
*  far stronger than China, far stronger than anybody, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1207.78s)]
*  and that's the way it is. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1210.78s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1211.78s)]
*  Would you like to ask a question, please? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1213.78s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1217.78s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1221.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1222.78s)]
*  This is Hiramoto from Nippon Television. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1223.78s)]
*  My question, let me ask two quick questions. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1226.78s)]
*  Sure. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1229.78s)]
*  First, this is the first meeting between Mr. President [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1230.78s)]
*  and Prime Minister Ishiba. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1234.78s)]
*  So what kind of impression do you have on him? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1236.78s)]
*  And, number two, do you have an idea, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1239.78s)]
*  or do you have a plan to impose tariff against Japan so far? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1242.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1246.78s)]
*  I think that he is going to be a great Prime Minister. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1248.78s)]
*  I think he's a very strong man, very, very strong. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1252.78s)]
*  I have great respect for him. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1254.78s)]
*  I've known him for a long time through a reputation. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1256.78s)]
*  Shinzo Abe thought the world of him, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1259.78s)]
*  and I think he's going to do a fantastic job as Prime Minister, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1261.78s)]
*  a very strong person. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1266.78s)]
*  I wish he wasn't so strong. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1268.78s)]
*  I wish he was a little bit weaker than that, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1270.78s)]
*  but that's what I got. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1272.78s)]
*  I have to get strong guys all the time. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1273.78s)]
*  He's going to be a great Prime Minister. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1275.78s)]
*  I also, in terms of tariffs, I mean, we're going to have tariffs, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1277.78s)]
*  mostly reciprocal tariffs, where we go with, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1282.78s)]
*  and I'm going to be probably meeting on that Monday or Tuesday, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1285.78s)]
*  have an announcement, probably a news conference, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1289.78s)]
*  but probably reciprocal tariffs where a country pays so much [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1291.78s)]
*  or charges us so much, and we do the same. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1296.78s)]
*  So very reciprocal, because I think that's the only fair way to do it. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1299.78s)]
*  That way nobody's hurt. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1303.78s)]
*  They charge us, we charge them. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1306.78s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1308.78s)]
*  And I seem to be going in that line, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1309.78s)]
*  as opposed to a flat fee tariff. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1311.78s)]
*  Okay? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1314.78s)]
*  Yes, go, please. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1318.78s)]
*  Please, go ahead. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1320.78s)]
*  Why don't you go ahead? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1321.78s)]
*  The other person. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1323.78s)]
*  Here, I'll hold onto it. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1324.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1326.78s)]
*  This is Ota from Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1328.78s)]
*  I have a question for Prime Minister Ishiba. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1332.78s)]
*  So this is your very first summit meeting. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1334.78s)]
*  What was your impression of President Trump? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1337.78s)]
*  Were you able to build a good relationship of trust and confidence in Northeast Asia? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1339.78s)]
*  There are many challenges, China, North Korea, and so forth. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1345.78s)]
*  And with President Trump, what did you appeal to him, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1349.78s)]
*  and what kind of understanding were you able to obtain? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1353.78s)]
*  On the economic field, there is the acquisition of U.S. steel, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1356.78s)]
*  the buy Nippon steel, and there are expansion of import of LMG. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1361.78s)]
*  What kind of communication discussion did you have with President Trump? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1366.78s)]
*  For the $1 trillion of investment from Japan to investment, what was his reaction? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1370.78s)]
*  What about your communication on tariff front? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1375.78s)]
*  This is the first time that I met with President Trump in person. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1380.78s)]
*  So this was the first time meeting face to face. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1386.78s)]
*  But for many, many years, I have watched him on television. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1390.78s)]
*  So it was quite—I was so excited to see such a celebrity on television, to see in person. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1395.78s)]
*  On television, he is frightening, and he has a very strong personality. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1403.78s)]
*  But when I met with him, actually, he was very sincere and very powerful [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1412.78s)]
*  and with strong will for the United States and for the whole world. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1421.78s)]
*  I was able to feel that this is not the sort of polishing or trying to suck up to him. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1428.78s)]
*  For the world peace and for the regional stability that both of our countries need to play our role [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1440.78s)]
*  and make our endeavors and responsibility. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1449.78s)]
*  As for the increase of our defense expenditures, it is not that we are told by the United States to do so. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1453.78s)]
*  Japan, on our own decision and on our own responsibility, we need to increase our defense expenditures. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1460.78s)]
*  But, of course, we need to communicate and consult with the United States. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1470.78s)]
*  But the responsibility is with Japan and the decision is with Japan. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1475.78s)]
*  Now, on the tariffs, that if it is mutually beneficial, tariffs need to be set. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1480.78s)]
*  And as for Japan, as Mr. President has introduced to us, an unprecedented investment will be made [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1493.78s)]
*  from Japan to the United States, and so many jobs will be created. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1502.78s)]
*  So $1 trillion is the target. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1507.78s)]
*  And this will be to the benefit of the United States, but also to the benefit of Japan as well. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1512.78s)]
*  Investment is mutually beneficial. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1519.78s)]
*  So be it with the US deal, as Mr. President says, it is not acquisition. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1523.78s)]
*  It is investment. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1529.78s)]
*  So the Japanese technology will be provided, and the better quality products will be manufactured [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1532.78s)]
*  in the United States, and the US deal will make products which will contribute not only to the United States [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1542.78s)]
*  and Japan, but also to the whole world. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1549.78s)]
*  It is not one-sided. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1551.78s)]
*  It will be reciprocal. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1553.78s)]
*  It will be mutually beneficial. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1555.78s)]
*  And I believe we were able to share on this, and that is the biggest result that I have seen today. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1558.78s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1567.78s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1568.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1569.78s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, I have a question about the US deal. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1570.78s)]
*  So you're saying that is this a restructuring of the deal that's happening, and then will you approve? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1577.78s)]
*  They're doing it as an investment, no longer a purchase. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1583.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1586.78s)]
*  I didn't want it purchased, but investment I love. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1587.78s)]
*  And they're going to do a big investment, subject to getting the deal done, and they'll be doing a big deal. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1590.78s)]
*  And that's something you would approve, where the US- [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1595.78s)]
*  I'm okay with that, sure. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1596.78s)]
*  And for the Prime Minister, what was your argument to the President related to the US deal? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1598.78s)]
*  And one more on tariffs, Mr. President, if I could. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1602.78s)]
*  You said on tariffs that you'd like them to be reciprocal back and forth. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1606.78s)]
*  What was the reception from the Japanese Prime Minister when you said that, or when you talked about- [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1610.78s)]
*  Well, we didn't discuss tariffs too much. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1615.78s)]
*  We really discussed many other things, including the pipeline in Alaska, which I think is going to be maybe the most exciting thing with Doug and Chris. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1617.78s)]
*  We discussed that at length, the pipeline. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1625.78s)]
*  I mean, it seemed to be of great interest to them. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1628.78s)]
*  It's- we have potentially more oil and gas than in Saudi Arabia, just in Alaska. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1631.78s)]
*  We have the most of any country in the world. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1638.78s)]
*  It's a big asset for the United States, but we haven't used it. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1640.78s)]
*  We go to Venezuela, we go to other places to take oil and gas, and we have more than anybody. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1643.78s)]
*  It's an amazing phenomena that took place over the last four years. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1648.78s)]
*  Nobody understands it, including the people that were in charge of it. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1652.78s)]
*  They had no clue what they were doing. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1655.78s)]
*  So it was a big problem. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1657.78s)]
*  They were surprised, actually, too. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1659.78s)]
*  They were saying, why didn't they- they wouldn't sell them LNG. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1661.78s)]
*  They wouldn't sell it. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1666.78s)]
*  Japan wanted to buy LNG, and Biden wouldn't sell it. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1667.78s)]
*  And I'm trying to figure that one out. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1671.78s)]
*  Maybe it was the environment. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1673.78s)]
*  You might answer that question. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1675.78s)]
*  He's curious about that himself, I think. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1677.78s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1682.78s)]
*  If you want to answer that, you may, about LNG, that the United States wouldn't sell you LNG. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1685.78s)]
*  That was a really unfortunate thing, but the current administration- I'm sorry, the previous administration was not allowing the LNG to be exported to us. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1691.78s)]
*  I believe that President Trump, on the day of his inauguration, allowed us to resume this importing. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1711.78s)]
*  I think this is something that is really wonderful for us. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1719.78s)]
*  And as the country of Japan, we are interested in importing not just LNG, but also bioethanol, ammonia, and other resources at a stable price, a reasonable price, from the United States. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1723.78s)]
*  And we also want to improve the trade deficit that the U.S. has towards Japan. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1740.78s)]
*  So if we are able to buy those at a stable and reasonable price, I think it would be a wonderful situation. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1748.78s)]
*  And for that, I am very appreciative to President Trump. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1756.78s)]
*  And we also look forward to LNG and hope that it's a success. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1760.78s)]
*  I wanted to say that on the ethanol, Iowa is going to be very happy. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1769.78s)]
*  All of the Nebraska, all of our farm states are going to be very happy. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1773.78s)]
*  They want ethanol, and we'll be able to provide it. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1776.78s)]
*  So our farmers, who I like and they like me, I think they're going to be very, very happy. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1779.78s)]
*  We've opened the sale of LNG immediately. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1785.78s)]
*  Actually, we did it a few days ago. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1788.78s)]
*  And China- right now, not only China, everybody wants to buy it. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1790.78s)]
*  We have more than anybody, and they're all buying it. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1795.78s)]
*  But Japan in particular, we're very happy that they're going to start immediately. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1797.78s)]
*  And we can supply it to the world, but we're supplying it to Japan. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1802.78s)]
*  And they can always be right up in the front of the line. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1806.78s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead, please. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1809.78s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1811.78s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1812.78s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, I have a question for you as well. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1813.78s)]
*  But, Mr. President, I'll start with you. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1814.78s)]
*  Quickly, to follow up on what Peter was asking, have you directed Elon Musk to review Pentagon spending, given it's the biggest discretionary spending in the federal budget? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1815.78s)]
*  Yes, I have Pentagon, education, just about everything. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1823.78s)]
*  We're going to go through everything, just as it was so bad with what we just went through with this horrible situation we just went through. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1827.78s)]
*  And I guess 97 percent of the people have been dismissed. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1833.78s)]
*  It was very, very unfortunate. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1837.78s)]
*  You're not going to find anything like that, but you're going to find a lot. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1839.78s)]
*  And I've instructed him to go check out education, to check out the Pentagon, which is the military. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1842.78s)]
*  And, you know, sadly, you'll find some things that are pretty bad. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1848.78s)]
*  But I don't think proportionally you're going to see anything like we just saw. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1851.78s)]
*  And your FBI has turned over a list to the Justice Department of the FBI agents who worked on the January 6 rioters cases. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1855.78s)]
*  Are you planning to fire the FBI agents who worked on those investigations? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1862.78s)]
*  No, but I'll fire some of them, because some of them were corrupt. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1866.78s)]
*  I have no doubt about that. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1869.78s)]
*  I got to know a lot about that business, that world. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1871.78s)]
*  I got to know a lot about that world. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1875.78s)]
*  And we had some corrupt agents. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1877.78s)]
*  And those people are gone, or they will be gone. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1878.78s)]
*  And it'll be done quickly and very surgically. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1881.78s)]
*  Did you have a question for the prime minister? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1886.78s)]
*  Talk up. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1891.78s)]
*  Are those the ones who worked on the January 6th investigation? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1892.78s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1894.78s)]
*  I know we have some that are very corrupt and we don't like it. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1895.78s)]
*  We're going to bring back the reputation of the FBI. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1898.78s)]
*  Cash Patel is going to do a great job. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1901.78s)]
*  And we're going to bring back the reputation of the FBI, which has been hurt very badly. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1904.78s)]
*  It's been devastated over the last four years. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1908.78s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, you have just been meeting for the first time with President Trump. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1911.78s)]
*  The last administration famously did not have hardly any, if at all, contact with North Korea. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1917.78s)]
*  President Trump certainly did the last time he was in office. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1922.78s)]
*  Would you like to see him resume that contact and also that in-person meeting that he had with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1924.78s)]
*  That is something that the United States needs to determine on its own. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1939.78s)]
*  And it's not something that we should request. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1945.78s)]
*  Having said that, but for example, in Vietnam or Singapore, the president of the United States, President Trump, was able to meet with Kim Jong-un. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1951.78s)]
*  I think that's a very positive development. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1968.78s)]
*  So now that President Trump is in power again, if we are able to move towards resolving issues with North Korea, I think it would be great. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1972.78s)]
*  And of course, for us, that includes not only denuclearization, but also resolving the abductee issue. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1986.78s)]
*  And so, not only the victims of the abductees, but also their families, too, are aging. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=1996.78s)]
*  And so, our time is limited. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2004.78s)]
*  So, if the president of the United States, if President Trump, is able to resolve this issue, we do understand that it's a Japan issue, first and foremost. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2006.78s)]
*  Having said that, we would love to continue to cooperate with them. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2018.78s)]
*  It's actually a good question, and we will have relations with North Korea and with Kim Jong-un. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2021.78s)]
*  I got along with him very well, as you know. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2027.78s)]
*  I think I stopped the war. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2029.78s)]
*  I think if I wouldn't have won that particular election, you would have ended up in a very bad situation. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2030.78s)]
*  But I did, and we had a good relationship. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2037.78s)]
*  And I think it's a very big asset for everybody that I do get along with him. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2040.78s)]
*  I like—I mean, I get along with him. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2044.78s)]
*  He gets along with me, and that's a good thing, not a bad thing. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2046.78s)]
*  And I can tell you that Japan likes the idea because their relationship is not very good with him. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2049.78s)]
*  And if I can have a relationship with not only him, but other people throughout the world where there seem to be difficulties, I think that's a tremendous asset for the world, not just the United States. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2056.78s)]
*  Go ahead, Garret. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2068.78s)]
*  I have a question for you and for the prime minister as well. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2069.78s)]
*  Mr. President, I wonder what you make of the criticism from Democrats that these staff reductions, the cuts that Elon Musk and Dozier are doing are an unlawful power grab. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2073.78s)]
*  Is there anything you've told Elon Musk he cannot touch? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2081.78s)]
*  Well, we haven't discussed that much. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2085.78s)]
*  I'll tell him to go here, go there. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2088.78s)]
*  He does it. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2090.78s)]
*  He's got a very capable group of people. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2091.78s)]
*  Very, very, very, very capable. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2093.78s)]
*  They know what they're doing. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2096.78s)]
*  They'll ask questions and they'll see immediately as somebody gets tongue tied that they're either crooked or don't know what they're doing. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2097.78s)]
*  We have very smart people going in. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2104.78s)]
*  So I've instructed him go into education, go into military, go into other things as we go along. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2106.78s)]
*  And they're finding massive amounts of fraud, abuse, waste, all of these things. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2112.78s)]
*  So but I will pick out a target. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2117.78s)]
*  And I say, go in. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2121.78s)]
*  There could be areas that we won't, but I think everything's fertile. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2122.78s)]
*  You know, we're a government. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2127.78s)]
*  We have to be open. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2128.78s)]
*  And as an open government, I don't know, I guess you could say maybe some high intelligence or something. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2129.78s)]
*  And I'll do that myself if I have to. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2134.78s)]
*  But generally speaking, I'll just say go. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2137.78s)]
*  But he will be looking at education pretty quickly and he will be looking at military too. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2141.78s)]
*  Both the federal spending is Social Security, Medicare programs like that. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2145.78s)]
*  Would you like to see him look at those programs as well? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2149.78s)]
*  Well, they don't really have to be looked at by him. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2151.78s)]
*  They can be looked at by us. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2154.78s)]
*  Social Security will not be touched. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2155.78s)]
*  It'll only be strengthened. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2157.78s)]
*  We have illegal immigrants on Social Security, and we're going to find out who they are and take them out. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2159.78s)]
*  We have illegal immigrants and other Medicare. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2164.78s)]
*  We have we've had a lot of bad people, a lot of people that shouldn't be on that were put on through California. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2169.78s)]
*  They come a lot of them come out of California. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2176.78s)]
*  We're not going to stand for that. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2179.78s)]
*  So we're going to strengthen our Social Security, et cetera. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2180.78s)]
*  We're not going to touch it other than to make it stronger. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2184.78s)]
*  But we have people that shouldn't be on and those people we have to weed out. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2187.78s)]
*  Most of them or many of them so far have been illegal immigrants. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2190.78s)]
*  They shouldn't even be in the country. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2194.78s)]
*  Do you have a question for the prime minister? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2195.78s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, the president's affinity for tariffs is well known. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2197.78s)]
*  If the U.S. places tariffs on Japanese imports, would Japan retaliate? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2201.78s)]
*  I am unable to respond to a theoretical question. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2206.78s)]
*  That's the official answer that we have. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2220.78s)]
*  That's a very good answer. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2222.78s)]
*  Very good answer. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2225.78s)]
*  Well, that's very good. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2227.78s)]
*  He knows what he's doing. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2230.78s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2231.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2233.78s)]
*  The president Trump has just wrapped up his meeting with the Japanese prime [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2243.78s)]
*  minister, Shigeru Ishiba, in which the two talked about increasing Japanese [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2248.78s)]
*  investment in the United States up to a trillion dollars. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2253.78s)]
*  That's the target, according to the Japanese prime minister. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2256.78s)]
*  They also talked about combating Chinese economic aggression and also military [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2258.78s)]
*  aggression in the region. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2264.78s)]
*  The Japanese prime minister also talked about his feelings about Donald Trump. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2266.78s)]
*  They were quite effusive. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2271.78s)]
*  He said he had watched him see he watched him on TV. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2272.78s)]
*  I was so excited to see such a celebrity, he said. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2275.78s)]
*  Let's now go to senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe, who [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2278.78s)]
*  is in the room. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2282.78s)]
*  Ed, this is the second world leader the president has met with. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2283.78s)]
*  What did you make of it? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2287.78s)]
*  Also notable that he said that on television the president appears to be ferocious, but [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2289.78s)]
*  in person is far more endearing. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2294.78s)]
*  As you pointed out, an important meeting with an ally in Asia. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2296.78s)]
*  Obviously a lot of conversation there about the future of the economic relationship. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2300.78s)]
*  Notable that he said he's open to more Japanese investment in U.S. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2305.78s)]
*  steel, but not an outright purchase. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2309.78s)]
*  That has been a big open question, especially because it was such a preoccupation of the [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2311.78s)]
*  final days of the Biden administration, whether or not to allow a sale to go forward or to [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2315.78s)]
*  block it as the company was seeking to be purchased by a Japanese firm. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2319.78s)]
*  Also telling that these two are meeting and that they, Japan of course, getting the first [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2323.78s)]
*  meeting, given concerns about China, its aggression of course across the Indo-Pacific, and the [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2331.78s)]
*  possibility that tariffs remain a real potential threat to the global economy. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2338.78s)]
*  Notable that the prime minister wouldn't entirely answer that question about whether or not [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2344.78s)]
*  they would retaliate should the United States put tariffs on Japan. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2348.78s)]
*  So this comes ahead of a series of meetings he's set to have next week with the leaders of [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2352.78s)]
*  Jordan and Egypt. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2357.78s)]
*  He suggested earlier today he might also be meeting at some point next week with the president [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2359.78s)]
*  of Ukraine, and that comes as the vice president is set to head to Europe for a series of meetings [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2363.78s)]
*  around a summit that's held every year in Munich, Germany. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2368.78s)]
*  So his global engagement is picking up now as he of course also focuses on those issues of [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2371.78s)]
*  government spending led by Elon Musk. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2377.78s)]
*  All right, Ed O'Keefe in the White House for us. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2379.78s)]
*  Let's switch now to Chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett who joins us from the nation's [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2382.78s)]
*  capital. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2386.78s)]
*  Major, we've seen the president so far in his brief administration act with coercion with [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2387.78s)]
*  respect to some of the U.S. allies. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2393.78s)]
*  This seemed to be much more a sign of cooperation. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2395.78s)]
*  What did you make of it? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2398.78s)]
*  Yes, John, but there was a very interesting tap dancing around this very large transaction. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2399.78s)]
*  Nippon Steel, U.S. Steel. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2407.78s)]
*  It's a $15 billion transaction. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2409.78s)]
*  President Biden, as Ed O'Keefe just mentioned, blocked it in the tail end of his presidency. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2411.78s)]
*  What President Trump said is it's now going to be an investment package. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2416.78s)]
*  That does not clear up anything about this at all, nor does it clear up the future of unionized [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2421.78s)]
*  U.S. steel workers in Indiana and Pennsylvania. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2425.78s)]
*  U.S. Steel and Nippon have sued the federal government over the blocking of this transaction. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2428.78s)]
*  How that gets resolved is completely opaque right now. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2434.78s)]
*  The Japanese prime minister did not say a single thing about it. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2437.78s)]
*  All President Trump said it would not be psychologically good for U.S. Steel to be purchased by Nippon [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2440.78s)]
*  Steel. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2446.78s)]
*  What does that mean to the underlying transaction and the future of those U.S. steel workers [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2447.78s)]
*  unionized all in Pennsylvania and Indiana, whose futures are dependent on some resolution [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2451.78s)]
*  of this? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2457.78s)]
*  That is consistent with the difficulties of working out this particular transaction. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2458.78s)]
*  And in this case, there was a diplomatic dance around it, the resolution to which we are [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2463.78s)]
*  still waiting for details. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2468.78s)]
*  It's an excellent point, Major. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2470.78s)]
*  In terms of that cooperation and coercion, it could very well be the case that President [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2471.78s)]
*  Trump, in saying that the Japanese steel company had dropped its bid to purchase, may have [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2475.78s)]
*  been trying to assert something that the Japanese prime minister would not necessarily agree [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2480.78s)]
*  with. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2484.78s)]
*  We'll have to follow that as it gets straightened out in the coming hours or days. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2485.78s)]
*  Thank you, Major Garrett. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2489.78s)]
*  Ed O'Keefe, our coverage will continue on CBS News 24-7, your local news. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7hnEC-EcnI&t=2490.78s)]
