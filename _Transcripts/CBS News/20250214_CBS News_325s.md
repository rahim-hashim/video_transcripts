# Trump bars federal funds for schools with COVID vaccine mandates
**CBS News:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84)
*  Welcome back. Great to have you with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump signed an executive order today [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=1.9000000000000001s)]
*  calling for the withholding of federal funds [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=4.42s)]
*  for schools and universities [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=7.78s)]
*  that impose a COVID-19 vaccine mandate. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=9.38s)]
*  Tom LoBianco and Stephanie Lai are back with us [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=13.06s)]
*  as part of our reporter panel. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=16.02s)]
*  Stephanie is in Munich. She's still there. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=17.22s)]
*  She hasn't taken a flight or a train anywhere else. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  Tom LoBianco, I won't let him leave the desk, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=21.02s)]
*  so he's right here with me. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=22.86s)]
*  Tom, I want to start with you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=24.0s)]
*  Okay, does this really mean anything? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=25.7s)]
*  Is this an executive order to grab headlines [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=28.62s)]
*  or actually do something? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=31.26s)]
*  Yeah, there's show horse and work horse. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=33.02s)]
*  Okay, yes, I've heard of that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=35.3s)]
*  This one seems more like a show horse. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=37.1s)]
*  Okay, why? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  Schools do not mandate this. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=40.2s)]
*  Right now? K-12. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=42.5s)]
*  They're not doing it. No, it's not. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=43.5s)]
*  Colleges, some, still mandate this. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=45.3s)]
*  Small number. 15, yeah, something like that. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  15, yeah. 15, yeah. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=49.74s)]
*  This feels like, now, the question next [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=51.38s)]
*  on all these executive orders, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  because we've seen this with the use of DEI, for instance, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=54.72s)]
*  is it about a hammer for something else? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=59.58s)]
*  Is it preparatory for something else? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=63.28s)]
*  Yes, yeah. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  Will it be used, because remember, too, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=66.52s)]
*  Musk is already getting into the Department of Education [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=68.56s)]
*  to eliminate a lot of funding in there. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=72.1s)]
*  Whether or not that holds [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=74.72s)]
*  will be a question of the courts, obviously. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=75.96s)]
*  This feels in line with that, concurrent with that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=79.34s)]
*  So is this a hammer? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=83.58s)]
*  It feels more like a hammer right now, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=85.18s)]
*  not directly effective. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=87.24s)]
*  Stephanie, I'm glad Tom mentioned the word hammer, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=89.17999999999999s)]
*  excuse me, because I wonder if there, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=92.58s)]
*  at the Munich Security Conference, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=95.12s)]
*  in addition to all the other [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=96.82s)]
*  national security foreign policy issues [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=98.66s)]
*  that we discussed earlier, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=100.46s)]
*  there was this long-running conversation this week [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=102.02s)]
*  with lots of ups and downs about tariffs [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=104.2s)]
*  and whether they will or will not happen, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=106.3s)]
*  lots of rhetoric from President Trump [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=108.7s)]
*  about the European Union, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=109.94s)]
*  if those at the Munich Security Conference [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=111.53999999999999s)]
*  perceive that tariff talk as another kind of hammer [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=115.2s)]
*  from the Trump administration? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=119.14s)]
*  That's a really interesting question, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=121.44000000000001s)]
*  and I think it will depend on who you speak to, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=122.74000000000001s)]
*  but I think largely a lot of the European leaders [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=125.02000000000001s)]
*  have started to recognize some of Trump's mannerisms, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=127.78s)]
*  and having dealt with him in the first administration, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=130.82s)]
*  they understand that there are moments [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=133.18s)]
*  where he might float an idea [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=135.06s)]
*  that ends up being more of a negotiation tactic [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=136.9s)]
*  rather than a solid plan [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=139.4s)]
*  or something that will go into effect immediately. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=142.46s)]
*  I think that's what we've been seeing [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=144.74s)]
*  with these reciprocal tariffs [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=145.98s)]
*  that we believe will come into place in April, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=147.14s)]
*  but of course all the timing, the levels, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=149.78s)]
*  they remain pretty fluid right now, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=152.62s)]
*  and I think that's one of those signs [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=154.66s)]
*  for European leaders that this is an opportunity for them [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=156.4s)]
*  to go to the negotiation table [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=159.32s)]
*  or to start up conversations to prevent any tariffs [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=161.1s)]
*  from actually getting put in place. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=163.56s)]
*  And Stephanie, does it feel like the Trump administration [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=165.46s)]
*  is trying to insert itself [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=167.7s)]
*  into European democratic conversations? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=169.4s)]
*  We talked about the censorship allegation [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=172.18s)]
*  a moment ago, but also Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=174.28s)]
*  talking about increasing defense budgets. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=177.52s)]
*  Well, to do that, the governments have to do that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=179.4s)]
*  with the consent of the people in their own country, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=181.26s)]
*  which has been something that has been problematic [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=183.4s)]
*  over the years. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=186.46s)]
*  That's gotta be part of the conversation there, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=187.8s)]
*  I would imagine. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=189.42000000000002s)]
*  I would imagine that too. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=191.08s)]
*  I think another thing to note [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=192.08s)]
*  is that for some of these European leaders, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=193.32s)]
*  the sense is that they already are contributing quite a bit. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=195.36s)]
*  When the Trump administration says [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=198.56s)]
*  that they're not pulling their weight [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=200.08s)]
*  in terms of defense spending, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=201.32s)]
*  that doesn't always account for some of the other forms [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  of aid that these European countries are providing [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=205.39999999999998s)]
*  for Ukraine in efforts to resolve [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=208.2s)]
*  or find a conflict for the war. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=211.2s)]
*  And so oftentimes, that message [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=213.04s)]
*  might not necessarily resonate with Europeans. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=216.0s)]
*  And it's definitely something that was under consideration [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=218.88s)]
*  and perhaps one of the sticking points [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=222.2s)]
*  between the Trump administration [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=224.0s)]
*  and the delegation from the US [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=226.04s)]
*  and the rest of the world leaders. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=227.83999999999997s)]
*  And Tom, to Stephanie's point, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  several of the European countries closest to Ukraine [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=231.36s)]
*  would say, Mr. President, Mr. President Trump, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  whether you think we are providing large enough checks [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=236.72000000000003s)]
*  for military or economic aid, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=241.08s)]
*  we have absorbed hundreds of thousands of refugees [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=242.52s)]
*  from that war and done so at our cost [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=245.52s)]
*  and at our accommodation. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=247.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=249.36s)]
*  If you talk with European diplomats throughout this, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=250.44000000000003s)]
*  and we were going on three years of this, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=254.0s)]
*  certainly it was not ended in the first 24 hours [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=257.36s)]
*  of this administration. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=259.6s)]
*  They blew up that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=262.24s)]
*  One of the long running campaign promises, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=263.08000000000004s)]
*  if you remember. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=264.48s)]
*  First day, 24 hours, I can do this, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=265.76000000000005s)]
*  I can end this right away. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=267.8s)]
*  Not happening. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=270.20000000000005s)]
*  Is that they are the physical buffer. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=271.72s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=274.76000000000005s)]
*  And I remember talking with a few diplomats [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=275.6s)]
*  a couple of years ago about this [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=280.24s)]
*  and questions about China and Taiwan [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=282.12s)]
*  because we have to be positioned in all things [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=284.04s)]
*  as a global superpower. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=286.92s)]
*  And they said, if you want to deal with that, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  first you have to deal with, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  if you want Europe's support in these matters, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=292.32s)]
*  first you have to deal with Ukraine [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=295.2s)]
*  because for that reason, we are absorbing this hit. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  So, again, this talk about Poland, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=301.16s)]
*  putting forces in to bolster again, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=305.16s)]
*  potentially against Ukraine again. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=308.64s)]
*  There are lots of ways to support, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=312.32s)]
*  lots of ways to assist. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegGLmeif84&t=314.44s)]
