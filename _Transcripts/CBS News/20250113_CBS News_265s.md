# How to talk to kids about the Los Angeles fires
**CBS News:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk)
*  California officials say the Palisades and Eden fires are now among the most destructive in the state's history. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=0.0s)]
*  Of the more than 12,000 structures that have burned in a week, many of those are people's homes. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=6.0s)]
*  As the country, state, and individual families deal with this unprecedented tragedy, it imposes the question of how to discuss this type of loss with children and teens. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=11.0s)]
*  Lisa D'Amour joins us now. She's a clinical psychologist specializing in the development of teenagers. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=20.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here. So for families within the threat zone, how can parents talk to their kids and teens about staying strong, staying hopeful while they themselves are struggling? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=25.0s)]
*  Right. This is the key question. The parents and caregivers are in it every bit as much as their kids. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=35.0s)]
*  So one of the first things they can do is they can establish that being emotional isn't the same as being fragile. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=41.0s)]
*  And they can just say that to their kids because, of course, they're going to be emotional. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=47.0s)]
*  They're going to be crying. They're going to be worrying. They're going to be talking about their own uncomfortable feelings. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=51.0s)]
*  What we want kids to understand is that this is not a sign of a person being in a bad place. It's actually a sign of them handling it well. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=57.0s)]
*  The distress is a done deal. What we want is for adults to cope well with it and to model that healthy coping for their kids. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=65.0s)]
*  So in terms of modeling, does that essentially mean everything is fine? Everything is hunky dory. Everything is going to be great. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=74.0s)]
*  I mean, how do parents also teach that resiliency? Yes, this is hard. We will get through it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=82.0s)]
*  One of the things that adults can pay attention to is what I call the lyrics and the tune, the lyrics being the words we say and the tune being tone in which we say them. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=86.0s)]
*  So the lyrics can be actually very honest and very direct. We can say, I am really sad. I am worried. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=96.0s)]
*  This was really frightening while doing it in a tone that makes it clear that we are OK. We are not coming unglued. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=102.0s)]
*  We are there to be a steady presence for our kids. So you don't have to do one or the other. You don't have to do sunny reassurance. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=110.0s)]
*  You don't have to be coming apart at the seams. You can tell a true story about how hard it is while also offering reassurance to your kids. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=116.0s)]
*  I mean, for a lot of these people, we are talking and looking at the video of people whose lives are completely upended. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=124.0s)]
*  Every part of their living situation and routine is different now. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=130.0s)]
*  Changing the routine of a child or a teenager can be jarring in and of itself, but now people may be displaced. They may not have much with the clothes on their back. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=134.0s)]
*  How can adults best support ongoing trauma or anxiety as it relates to that upending and unknown? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=143.0s)]
*  Well, step number one is talk about it. Language helps us contain emotion. It brings things down to size. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=151.0s)]
*  Step number two is empathize to the degree that kids are expressing distress. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=156.0s)]
*  They are having the right reaction to just say that feeling makes sense. Of course, you're upset. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=160.0s)]
*  And I think step number three is be honest about what you know and what you don't know. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=165.0s)]
*  So adults can say things to kids like, OK, here's what we don't know. We're not entirely sure what our housing plans are going to be. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=170.0s)]
*  We're not quite sure how school is going to shake out. We don't even know where we're going to grocery shop. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=176.0s)]
*  Here's what we do know. We are going to keep you safe. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=180.0s)]
*  We are going to be with you every step of the way to support you. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=183.0s)]
*  And as we get more information, we will tell you what we know. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=187.0s)]
*  Those are the kinds of things kids need to hear right now. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=191.0s)]
*  And this is obviously a question for people who may not be directly impacted, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=194.0s)]
*  but are seeing all this imagery and feeling this empathy, feeling this compassion, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=199.0s)]
*  feeling very sad and impacted by what they are seeing and what we know that our fellow Americans or maybe friends or family are experiencing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=204.0s)]
*  Should we shield kids from these images, have a conversation about it? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=212.0s)]
*  What is the best way forward when we know that this is sort of inundating our media landscape right now? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=216.0s)]
*  It's always a good idea to shield young children, elementary school and age and younger, from very upsetting, traumatizing images across the board. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=223.0s)]
*  Once that is done, I think a key thing is to actually ask kids what they know or what they've heard, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=231.0s)]
*  because sometimes they have information that we don't have, and sometimes they have misinformation [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=237.0s)]
*  or have cobbled together a misunderstanding based on shards of information they've picked up. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=241.0s)]
*  So with kids of all ages, it's really appropriate to say, what have you heard about the fires in L.A.? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=246.0s)]
*  What do you understand? What questions do you have? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=252.0s)]
*  And what do you think we should do or you should do to try to be of help right now? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=255.0s)]
*  Okay. Dr. Lisa DeMore, we always appreciate when you come on. Thank you. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=260.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXj0mV8wpOk&t=264.0s)]
