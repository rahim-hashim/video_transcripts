# What we know about Trump's executive orders
**CBS News:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4)
*  And, Ed O'Keefe, what do we know about those executive actions by the president? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=0.0s)]
*  As we look through what has been announced so far today, what he's going to end up signing [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=4.8s)]
*  either in that event or later in the day back at the White House, a lot of it is kind of [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=11.38s)]
*  the old is new again, and a lot of it builds on things that he had suggested he might have [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=15.92s)]
*  done before. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=20.16s)]
*  So, for example, restoring drilling on federal lands in Alaska, that restores the drill baby [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=21.16s)]
*  drill move. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  Ending up drilling potentially off the coasts of the Atlantic and Pacific as well, if he [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=26.94s)]
*  can try to get around some Biden moves. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=30.0s)]
*  Things like withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=32.4s)]
*  That all goes back. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  Remain in Mexico, things like that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  So, old is new. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=37.14s)]
*  Declaring this national emergency support, southern border. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=38.14s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=40.14s)]
*  The new stuff is, for example, restoring the mandate that federal employees work from the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=41.14s)]
*  office most of the time, if not all the time. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=46.82s)]
*  That removes a COVID era policy that was put in place during the Biden years. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=48.92s)]
*  Ending diversity initiatives. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=52.32s)]
*  And ending diversity, equity, inclusion initiatives. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=53.32s)]
*  We saw some agencies move quietly over the holidays to end them already. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=55.22s)]
*  The rest will have to be ended in the coming weeks. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=58.86s)]
*  And then taking more aggressive steps like characterizing these drug cartels and international [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=61.26s)]
*  gangs as terrorist organizations. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=65.86s)]
*  That's a big bold move that he had proposed during his first term. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=67.62s)]
*  Didn't take it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=70.74s)]
*  Now argues, given the times and the political mandate that's there, that he can do that [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=71.74s)]
*  now, even if it draws the ire of Mexico and other Latin American countries. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=76.34s)]
*  I have a question. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=79.42s)]
*  If the president signs orders designating some of these drug cartels as global terrorists, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=81.46000000000001s)]
*  what does that mean? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=88.5s)]
*  And how does that enable him to use, for instance, military force against them? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=89.5s)]
*  This is one of those really thorny and complicated issues for a variety of reasons. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=94.14s)]
*  That being one of them, I believe you talked to Mark Esper, the former secretary of defense, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=98.78s)]
*  saying that Donald Trump had wanted in the first term to actually bomb locations inside [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=102.62s)]
*  of Mexico. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=107.86s)]
*  Only I think at this point our largest trading partner, but a huge partner on a variety of [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=109.3s)]
*  fronts. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=114.58s)]
*  One of the reasons why when members of Congress have floated this and the Biden administration [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=115.58s)]
*  didn't take it up is also how complicated it is within Mexico internally and the existing [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=120.22s)]
*  government. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=125.48s)]
*  What does designating a terrorist group and all the things that come with it in terms [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=127.42s)]
*  of sanctions and all the things that come with it in terms of trying to stop access [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=130.74s)]
*  to the U.S. dollar, for example, mean when you're trying to do business with a government [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=134.62s)]
*  that does have ties to cartels at times in certain governments governing areas of the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=138.26s)]
*  country? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=145.57999999999998s)]
*  It's pretty messy. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=146.66s)]
*  And you need Mexico to stop movement of migrants also by foot from the south to the north. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=147.66s)]
*  So the Biden administration decided to try to work with Mexico rather than come out. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=153.26s)]
*  What has the president, the new president of Mexico, said about working with the Trump [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=156.73999999999998s)]
*  administration? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=160.45999999999998s)]
*  She said a few different things. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=161.45999999999998s)]
*  She recently said, you know, we'll have to wait and see. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=163.22s)]
*  I've been asking the Mexican government a few times this morning for immediate reaction [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=165.98s)]
*  here. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=169.74s)]
*  We haven't seen much in terms of directly responding to this. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=170.74s)]
*  But you know, the slogan of the prior president and now Claudia Scheinbaum, the existing president, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=174.02s)]
*  has been not to take the cartels on directly. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=178.34s)]
*  The slogan was was hugs, not bullets, to try to, you know, offset the control of the cartels [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=181.74s)]
*  but not go at them. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=187.84s)]
*  And Donald Trump is obviously trying to push the Mexican government towards a more direct [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=189.14s)]
*  conflict. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=195.33999999999997s)]
*  The one thing the Mexican foreign ministry did say this morning is that they've bolstered [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=196.33999999999997s)]
*  the 53 consulates they have in this country providing more manpower to deal with the incoming [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=200.01999999999998s)]
*  from Mexican nationals who may live here, understanding that they're going to be getting [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=204.82s)]
*  a lot more questions. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=207.82s)]
*  And anyone in the state of Texas knows how important that cross-border trade and production [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=208.82s)]
*  is. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=213.82s)]
*  This gets really, really messy really quickly on the trade front and just for basic employment. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=214.82s)]
*  So it sounds good on paper to say let's go head to head and let's but it can be good. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=220.3s)]
*  It can't backfire. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78dqoJ1Fg4&t=225.86s)]
