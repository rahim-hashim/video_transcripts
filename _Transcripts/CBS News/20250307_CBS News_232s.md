**CBS News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs)

*  Reviving the controversial practice of detaining migrant families with children in ice custody [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=7.24s)]
*  CBS News immigration and politics reporter Camilla Montoya Galvez joins us here live in studio 55 Camilla always great to see you [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  Good morning. Good morning [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=21.12s)]
*  family detention [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=23.04s)]
*  Controversial term we've heard of so many times is this really a feasible option [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=25.08s)]
*  Especially considering the capacity of these ice facilities. Well make no mistake [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=29.88s)]
*  Errol this is a significant change by the Trump administration [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=34.16s)]
*  Long-term family immigration detention was discontinued in 2021 back during the Biden administration [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  Because advocates and other officials argued that it was harmful to children and their psychological well-being because we're talking about [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=44.0s)]
*  Parents who are crossing the border illegally with minor children who are under the age of 17 and now the Trump administration is converting to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=51.36s)]
*  Detention facilities run by immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE in Texas into family detention centers [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=59.36s)]
*  In fact one in Carn City south of San Antonio is now housing several families including three children [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=65.08s)]
*  We have learned here at CBS News and the question about conditions is a good one because advocates will argue that [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=71.44s)]
*  There are no conditions that are adequate to be detaining minor children [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=76.92s)]
*  But of course the term of this vision believes that this is needed to deter migrant families from crossing the border illegally now [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=80.84s)]
*  dissolving temporary protected status the program has been a target for the Trump administration and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=87.28s)]
*  How might that though impact Ukrainian refugees because so many of them are also in the US under that protection [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=93.52s)]
*  It's a critical question just to level said back in [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine the Biden administration set up a program known as uniting for Ukraine that allowed Americans to [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=103.25999999999999s)]
*  sponsor the entry in the arrival of Ukrainian refugees fleeing that conflict and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=110.58s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians came under that process that program has since been suspended by the Trump administration and the administration is [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=114.82s)]
*  considering ending it and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=123.3s)]
*  Potentially revoking the legal status of the individuals who came under that policy [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=125.3s)]
*  But we are told by officials at the Department of Homeland Security that no final decisions have been made yet [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=129.85999999999999s)]
*  And when it comes to temporary protective status or TPS that was also granted to Ukrainians and the administration is moving quickly [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=135.29999999999998s)]
*  To face out many TPS programs and it has already done so for Venezuelans and Haitians [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=142.7s)]
*  I'm with the Ukrainian or from Central or South America. You wonder what happens to these people their families their livelihood [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=147.57999999999998s)]
*  another topic that you've been doing some in-depth reporting on is how [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=153.29999999999998s)]
*  Immigration and policies are impacting the price of milk. Tell us about that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=157.06s)]
*  That's right [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=161.5s)]
*  So we traveled to the heart of America's dairy land, Wisconsin to see firsthand how interconnected the issues of immigration [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=161.94s)]
*  Milk production and labor are and they are very much deeply connected [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=170.06s)]
*  We went to one farm that really is a microcosm of that situation [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=174.52s)]
*  The farmer there told us that most of his employees are in the US illegally [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=178.98000000000002s)]
*  They are immigrants from Mexico and that he has tried to hire [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=184.0s)]
*  American citizens to work on the farm to milk the cows [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=188.08s)]
*  But none have showed up to apply for that job [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  And so he has to rely now on undocumented immigrants for labor and we pose him the question [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  What happens Errol if all these people who are working on your farm are deported as the general administration would like and he said [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=199.38s)]
*  He would go out of business immediately [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  It's another example of these employers saying they would hire Americans if Americans would take those jobs [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=207.68s)]
*  I'm eager to see some more of your reporting. We kill it Camilla. I'm a toy of our best. Great to see you [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=214.06s)]
*  Thanks for this and to learn more about the connection between [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=217.96s)]
*  Immigrant workers and dairy prices watch CBS reports [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=221.52s)]
*  It's a new documentary the price of milk premiering Sunday on CBS News 24-7 and on Paramount Plus [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70zAxcNaQLs&t=225.08s)]
