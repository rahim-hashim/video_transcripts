# Bernie Sanders on common ground with RFK Jr. at Senate hearing
**CBS News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y)
*  Senator Sanders. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=1.32s)]
*  Mr. Kennedy, thanks for being with us. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=3.36s)]
*  I very much like the slogan that you coined, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  make America healthy again. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=10.68s)]
*  And I strongly agree with that effort. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=13.72s)]
*  Despite spending, as you indicated, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=18.44s)]
*  two or three times as much per capita on health care [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=20.48s)]
*  as other nations, we have 85 million people [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=23.0s)]
*  who are uninsured, underinsured. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  We have all kinds of chronic illnesses. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=28.84s)]
*  Our life expectancy is lower than other countries. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=31.52s)]
*  And for working class people in this country, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=34.28s)]
*  they are living six, seven years shorter lives [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=37.04s)]
*  than the top 1%. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=39.92s)]
*  We got a problem. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=41.6s)]
*  And I'm going to suggest some ideas that I [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=43.32s)]
*  think can remedy that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=45.8s)]
*  Last year, the insurance industry in this country [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=48.16s)]
*  made over $70 billion, while at the same time, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=50.74s)]
*  85 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=55.88s)]
*  Do you agree with me that the United States [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  should join every other major country on Earth [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=63.64s)]
*  and guarantee health care to all people as a human right? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=66.48s)]
*  Yes? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=71.56s)]
*  No. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=72.16s)]
*  Senator, I can't give you a yes or no answer to that question. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=77.08s)]
*  Health care a human right? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=80.12s)]
*  Is health care a human right? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=81.84s)]
*  In the way that free speech, the human right, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=84.28s)]
*  I would say it's different. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=88.52s)]
*  Because with free speech, it doesn't cost anybody anything. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=90.64s)]
*  But in health care, if you smoke cigarettes for 20 years [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=95.08s)]
*  and you get cancer, you are now taking from the pool. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=101.2s)]
*  And so are you guaranteed the same right? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=107.12s)]
*  Or is there also a duty? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=109.56s)]
*  Look, I'm sorry. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=111.04s)]
*  I'd love to talk for an hour with you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=112.04s)]
*  We've got a few minutes left here. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=114.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  Every other country says health care, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=117.16000000000001s)]
*  whether you're poor or rich, younger role to human right. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=119.0s)]
*  I'm not hearing you say that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  You've talked about the drug companies. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=123.74000000000001s)]
*  And maybe we agree on this one. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  As you all know, despite the drug companies [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=127.36000000000001s)]
*  making over $100 billion in profits, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  paying CEOs outrageous compensation packages, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  we in some cases pay 10 times more for the same drug. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=135.32s)]
*  Will you support legislation that I [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=139.48000000000002s)]
*  will introduce which says that in America, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=141.58s)]
*  we should not be paying a nickel more for prescription drugs [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=144.26000000000002s)]
*  than people around the rest of the world? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=147.62s)]
*  Yes, no. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=149.78s)]
*  To equalize it? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=152.06s)]
*  Not to equalize it, that we should not [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=154.42000000000002s)]
*  be paying more than other countries for the same damn [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=156.22000000000003s)]
*  drug. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=159.54000000000002s)]
*  President Trump has asked me, in fact, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=160.74s)]
*  I had a meeting with President Trump a week ago [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=165.34s)]
*  where we showed him the charts. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=168.38000000000002s)]
*  He knows the charts. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=170.7s)]
*  I question it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=171.7s)]
*  We're paying 10 times more from Europe. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=172.45999999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=174.42s)]
*  And are you going to commit to us [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=175.17999999999998s)]
*  that you will end that absurdity? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=177.42s)]
*  I think in principle, we can. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=179.33999999999997s)]
*  We should end that disparity. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=181.33999999999997s)]
*  Good. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=183.89999999999998s)]
*  OK. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=184.38s)]
*  That's great. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=184.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=185.54s)]
*  I happen to believe that climate change is real. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=187.14s)]
*  It's an existential threat. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=190.98s)]
*  And it is a health care issue. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=192.45999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump thinks that it is a hoax originating in China. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=196.62s)]
*  Question is, in your judgment, is climate change a hoax [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=201.22s)]
*  or is it real, causing devastating problems? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=206.62s)]
*  President Trump and I, from the beginning, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=209.38s)]
*  from our first meeting, agreed to disagree on that issue. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=211.82s)]
*  I believe climate change is existential. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=214.46s)]
*  My job is to make Americans healthy again. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=217.9s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=220.46s)]
*  You believe the charts. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=220.96s)]
*  You disagree with Trump. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=222.66s)]
*  You don't think climate change is a hoax, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=224.66s)]
*  is what I'm hearing. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=226.78s)]
*  My job here is to make Americans healthy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=227.57999999999998s)]
*  I'm just asking you, not to say, Kenny. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=229.1s)]
*  Not at your question. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=230.18s)]
*  I answered your question, Senator Sanders. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=231.02s)]
*  OK. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=232.58s)]
*  You disagree with the president on that. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=233.08s)]
*  I answered your question. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=234.86s)]
*  OK. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=236.98000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to pick up on a point that Senator Hassan made. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=238.14000000000001s)]
*  Look, there is no question that abortion [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=240.74s)]
*  is a divisive issue in this country. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=244.3s)]
*  I would say a majority of the people are pro-choice. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=247.3s)]
*  There's a strong minority who are pro-life. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=249.94s)]
*  A year and a half ago, you went to New Hampshire, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=253.5s)]
*  running for president, gave a speech, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=256.78000000000003s)]
*  and you talked about government should not [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=259.42s)]
*  tell a woman what she can do with her own body. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=261.94s)]
*  That's her choice. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=265.66s)]
*  Now, I think everybody on that side is pro-life. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=267.58000000000004s)]
*  I think everybody here is pro-choice. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=271.06s)]
*  I have never seen any major politician flip on that issue [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=273.62s)]
*  quite as quickly as you did when Trump asked [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=278.26s)]
*  you to become HHS secretary. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=282.42s)]
*  Tell me why you think people should [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=285.66s)]
*  have confidence in your consistency and in your word [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=288.14s)]
*  when you really made a major U-turn on an issue [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=293.46s)]
*  of that importance in such a short time. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=296.74s)]
*  Senator, I believe, and I've always [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=300.18s)]
*  believed that every abortion is a tragedy. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=303.38s)]
*  But you told the people of New Hampshire [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=306.46s)]
*  that it was their right. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=308.41999999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=310.26s)]
*  Let me do one last question here, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=310.74s)]
*  because I'm running out of time. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=312.09999999999997s)]
*  I think the gist of what you're trying to say today [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=314.3s)]
*  is you're really pro-vaccine. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=316.86s)]
*  You want to ask questions. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=319.78000000000003s)]
*  You have started a group called the Children's Health Defense. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=321.90000000000003s)]
*  You're the original. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=326.78000000000003s)]
*  Right now, as I understand it, on their website, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=328.7s)]
*  they are selling what's called onesies. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=331.82s)]
*  These are little things, clothing for babies. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=333.3s)]
*  One of them is titled Unfaxed Unafraid. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=336.94s)]
*  Next one, and they're sold for $26 a piece, by the way. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=341.58000000000004s)]
*  Next one is No Vax, No Problem. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=345.1s)]
*  Now, you're coming before this committee, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=348.90000000000003s)]
*  and you say you're pro-vaccine. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=350.78000000000003s)]
*  Just want to ask some questions. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=353.02000000000004s)]
*  And yet, your organization is making money selling a child's [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=354.38s)]
*  product to parents for $26, which [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=359.5s)]
*  casts fundamental doubt on the usefulness of vaccines. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=363.3s)]
*  Can you tell us now that you will, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=367.98s)]
*  now that you are pro-vaccine, that you're [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=370.66s)]
*  going to have your organization take [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=374.34s)]
*  these products off the market? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=376.17999999999995s)]
*  Senator, I have no power over that organization. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=377.82s)]
*  I'm not a part of it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=380.14s)]
*  I resigned from the board. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=381.06s)]
*  That was just a few months ago. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=382.29999999999995s)]
*  You founded that. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=383.82s)]
*  You certainly have power. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=385.41999999999996s)]
*  You can make that call. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=386.73999999999995s)]
*  Are you supportive of this? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=387.97999999999996s)]
*  I've had nothing to do with leadership. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=389.85999999999996s)]
*  Are you supportive of these onesies? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=391.58s)]
*  I'm supportive of vaccines. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=393.05999999999995s)]
*  Are you supportive of this clothing, which [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=394.7s)]
*  is militantly anti-vaccine? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=397.46s)]
*  I am supportive of vaccines. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=400.21999999999997s)]
*  I want good science, and I want to protect the vaccine. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=403.62s)]
*  But you will not tell the organization [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=406.14s)]
*  you founded not to continue selling that product. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=408.09999999999997s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWGNJgaq0Y&t=411.53999999999996s)]
