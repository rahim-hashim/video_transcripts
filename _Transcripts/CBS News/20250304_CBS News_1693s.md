# Trump outlines his economic plans to Congress
**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU)
*  Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=0.0s)]
*  relief to working families. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=7.2s)]
*  As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=10.06s)]
*  Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs, and drove the necessities [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=20.12s)]
*  of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=26.66s)]
*  They've never had anything like it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=30.26s)]
*  We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=33.0s)]
*  They're not sure. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=39.3s)]
*  As president, I'm fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=40.68s)]
*  Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=56.62s)]
*  The egg price is out of control. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=66.94s)]
*  And we're working hard to get it back down. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=70.9s)]
*  Secretary, do a good job on that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=73.58s)]
*  You inherited a total mess from the previous administration. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=75.78s)]
*  Do a good job. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=79.53999999999999s)]
*  A major focus of our fight to defeat inflation is rapidly reducing the cost of energy. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  The previous administration cut the number of new oil and gas leases by 95 percent, slowed [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=95.64s)]
*  pipeline construction to a halt, and closed more than 100 power plants. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=102.46000000000001s)]
*  We are opening up many of those power plants right now. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=108.34s)]
*  And frankly, we have never seen anything like it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=116.62s)]
*  That's why on my first day in office, I declared a national energy emergency. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=126.26s)]
*  As you've heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=131.42000000000002s)]
*  on earth. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=141.54000000000002s)]
*  And by far, and now I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=142.7s)]
*  get it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=149.66s)]
*  It's called Drill Baby Drill. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=150.78s)]
*  My administration is also working on a gigantic natural gas pipeline in Alaska, among the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=167.26s)]
*  largest in the world, where Japan, South Korea, and other nations want to be our partner with [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=173.38s)]
*  investments of trillions of dollars each. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=178.98s)]
*  There's never been anything like that one. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=181.66s)]
*  It will be truly spectacular. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=184.22s)]
*  It's all set to go. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=185.94s)]
*  The permitting is gotten. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=186.94s)]
*  And later this week, I will also take historic action to dramatically expand production of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=188.94s)]
*  critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=194.62s)]
*  To further combat inflation, we will not only be reducing the cost of energy, but we'll [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=212.3s)]
*  be ending the flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=216.98s)]
*  And to that end, I have created the brand new Department of Government Efficiency, GOJ. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=220.78s)]
*  Perhaps you've heard of it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=238.78s)]
*  Perhaps. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=240.78s)]
*  Which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=242.58s)]
*  Thank you, Elon. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=272.38s)]
*  He's working very hard. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=273.38s)]
*  He didn't need this. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=274.38s)]
*  He didn't need this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=275.38s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=276.94s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=277.94s)]
*  Everybody here, even this side, appreciates it, I believe. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=278.94s)]
*  They just don't want to admit that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=282.41999999999996s)]
*  Just listen to some of the appalling waste we have already identified. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=287.65999999999997s)]

*  Nobody knows what that is. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=315.48s)]
*  $8 million to promote LGBTQI+, in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=319.18s)]

*  Under the Trump administration, all of these scams. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=460.18s)]
*  And they're far worse, but I didn't think it was appropriate to talk about them. They're so bad. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=463.18s)]
*  Many more have been found out and exposed and swiftly terminated by a group of very intelligent, mostly young people. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=469.18s)]
*  Headed up by Ilana, we appreciate it. We found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=477.18s)]
*  And we've taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=500.18s)]
*  Taking back a lot of that money. We got it just in time. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=506.18s)]
*  This is just the beginning. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=510.18s)]
*  The government's Accountability Office, the federal government office, has estimated annual fraud of over $500 billion in our nation. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=513.1800000000001s)]
*  And we are working very hard to stop it. We're going to. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=522.1800000000001s)]
*  We're also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security Program for our seniors. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=526.1800000000001s)]
*  And that our seniors and people that we love rely on. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=535.18s)]
*  Believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people aged 100 to 109 years old. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=540.18s)]
*  It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=555.18s)]
*  I don't know any of them. I know some people that are rather elderly, but not quite that elderly. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=563.18s)]
*  3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=569.18s)]
*  3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=577.18s)]
*  3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=585.18s)]
*  And money is being paid to many of them. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=594.18s)]
*  And we're searching right now. In fact, Pam, good luck. Good luck. You're going to find it. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=598.18s)]
*  But a lot of money is paid out to people because it just keeps getting paid and paid and nobody does. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=606.18s)]
*  And it really hurts Social Security and hurts our country. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=613.18s)]
*  1.3 million people from ages 150 to 159 and over. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=617.18s)]
*  130,000 people, according to the Social Security databases, are aged over 160 years old. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=623.18s)]
*  We have a healthier country than I thought, Babi. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=637.18s)]
*  Including, to finish, 1,039 people between the ages of 220 and 229. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=643.18s)]
*  One person between the ages of 240 and 249. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=664.18s)]
*  And one person is listed at 360 years of age. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=668.18s)]
*  More than 100 years. More than 100 years older than our country. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=675.18s)]
*  But we're going to find out where that money is going. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=684.18s)]
*  And it's not going to be pretty. By slashing all of the fraud, waste, and theft we can find. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=688.18s)]
*  We will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=693.18s)]
*  protect our seniors, and put more money in the pockets of American families. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=699.18s)]
*  And today interest rates took a beautiful drop. Big beautiful drop. It's about time. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=718.18s)]
*  And in the near future I want to do what has not been done in 24 years. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=724.18s)]
*  Balance the federal budget. We're going to balance it. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=731.18s)]
*  With that goal in mind, we have developed in great detail what we are calling the Gold Card, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=748.18s)]
*  which goes on sale very, very soon. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=760.18s)]
*  For $5 million we will allow the most successful job creating people from all over the world [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=763.18s)]
*  to buy a path to U.S. citizenship. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=770.18s)]
*  I don't know if you've heard of the Green Card, but it's like the Green Card, but better and more sophisticated. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=773.18s)]
*  And these people will have to pay tax in our country. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=778.18s)]
*  They won't have to pay tax from where they came. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=782.18s)]
*  The money that they've made, you wouldn't want to do that, but they have to pay tax, create jobs. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=785.18s)]
*  They'll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=789.18s)]
*  instead of having them being forced out. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=795.18s)]
*  I remember one at the top school as an example being forced out and not being allowed to stay [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=798.18s)]
*  and create tremendous numbers of jobs and great success for a company out there. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=803.18s)]
*  So while we take out the criminals, killers, traffickers, and child predators [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=808.18s)]
*  who are allowed to enter our country under the open border policy of these people, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=813.18s)]
*  the Democrats, the Biden administration, the open border, insane policies that you've allowed to destroy our country, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=819.18s)]
*  we will now bring in brilliant hard-working job creating people. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=827.18s)]
*  They're going to pay a lot of money and we're going to reduce our debt with that money. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=832.18s)]
*  Americans have given us a mandate for bold and profound change. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=848.18s)]
*  For nearly 100 years, the federal bureaucracy has grown until it has crushed our freedoms, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=854.18s)]
*  ballooned our deficits, and held back America's potential in every possible way. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=861.18s)]
*  The nation founded by pioneers and risk-takers now drowns under millions and millions of pages of regulations and debt. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=867.18s)]
*  Approvals that should take 10 days to get instead take 10 years, 15 years, and even 20 years before you reject it. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=877.18s)]
*  Meanwhile, we have hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have not been showing up to work. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=886.18s)]
*  My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=892.18s)]
*  and we will restore true democracy to America again. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=897.18s)]
*  And any federal bureaucrat who resists this change will be removed from office immediately. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=907.18s)]
*  Because we are draining the swamp. It's very simple. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=921.18s)]
*  And the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=927.18s)]
*  And the next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=937.18s)]
*  They're in there. They're waiting for you to vote. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=959.18s)]
*  And I'm sure that the people on my right, I don't mean the Republican right, but my right right here, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=962.18s)]
*  I'm sure you're going to vote for those tax cuts because otherwise I don't believe the people will ever vote you into office. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=969.18s)]
*  So I'm doing you a big favor by telling you that. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=975.18s)]
*  But I know this group is going to be voting for the tax cuts. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=979.18s)]
*  Thank you. It's a very, very big part of our plan. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=996.18s)]
*  We had tremendous success in our first term with it, a very big part of our plan. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=999.18s)]
*  And we're seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1003.18s)]
*  And to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation, I'm calling for no tax on tips, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1007.18s)]
*  no tax on overtime and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great seniors. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1015.18s)]
*  And I also want to make interest payments on car loans tax deductible, but only if the car is made in America. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1037.18s)]
*  And by the way, we're going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody's ever seen. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1059.18s)]
*  Plants are opening up all over the place. Deals are being made. Never seen. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1062.18s)]
*  That's a combination of the election win and tariffs. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1066.18s)]
*  It's a beautiful word, isn't it? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1069.18s)]
*  That along with our other policies will allow our auto industry to absolutely boom. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1072.18s)]
*  It's going to boom. Spoke to the majors today, all three the top people, and they're so excited. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1079.18s)]
*  In fact, already numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1085.18s)]
*  with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1092.18s)]
*  And this has taken place since our great victory on November 5th, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1111.18s)]
*  a date which will hopefully go down as one of the most important in the history of our country. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1115.18s)]
*  In addition, as part of our tax cuts, we want to cut taxes on domestic production and all manufacturing. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1126.18s)]
*  And just as we did before, we will provide 100 percent expensing. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1134.18s)]
*  It will be retroactive to January 20th, 2025. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1139.18s)]
*  And it was one of the main reasons why our tax cuts were so successful in our first term, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1144.18s)]
*  giving us the most successful economy in the history of our country. First term. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1150.18s)]
*  We had a great first term. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1156.18s)]
*  If you don't make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1164.18s)]
*  and in some cases a rather large one. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1170.18s)]
*  Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1173.18s)]
*  and now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1176.18s)]
*  On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada. Have you heard of them? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1181.18s)]
*  And countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1190.18s)]
*  It's very unfair. India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100 percent. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1196.18s)]
*  China's average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1203.18s)]
*  and South Korea's average tariff is four times higher. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1209.18s)]
*  Think of that four times higher. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1212.18s)]
*  And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1215.18s)]
*  but that's what happens. This is happening by friend and foe. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1219.18s)]
*  This system is not fair to the United States and never was, and so on April 2nd, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1224.18s)]
*  I wanted to make it April 1st, but I didn't want to be accused of April Fool's Day. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1229.18s)]
*  That's not just one day which costs us a lot of money, but we're going to do it in April. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1237.18s)]
*  I'm a very superstitious person. April 2nd, reciprocal tariffs kick in, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1244.18s)]
*  and whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1251.18s)]
*  That's reciprocal, back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1257.18s)]
*  If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1265.18s)]
*  then we will do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1272.18s)]
*  There's a lot of that too. They don't even allow us in their market. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1277.18s)]
*  We will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1281.18s)]
*  I did it with China and I did it with others, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1287.18s)]
*  and the Biden administration couldn't do anything about it [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1290.18s)]
*  because there was so much money they couldn't do anything about it. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1293.18s)]
*  We have been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1296.18s)]
*  and we will not let that happen any longer. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1300.18s)]
*  Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1314.18s)]
*  but we have very large deficits with both of them, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1320.18s)]
*  but even more importantly, they've allowed fentanyl to come into our country [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1323.18s)]
*  at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1327.18s)]
*  and many very young, beautiful people, destroying families. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1333.18s)]
*  Nobody's ever seen anything like it. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1337.18s)]
*  They are, in effect, receiving subsidies of hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1339.18s)]
*  We pay subsidies to Canada and to Mexico of hundreds of billions of dollars, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1343.18s)]
*  and the United States will not be doing that any longer. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1349.18s)]
*  We're not going to do it any longer. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1353.18s)]
*  Thanks to our America First policies we're putting into place, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1358.18s)]
*  we have had $1.7 trillion of new investment in America in just the past few weeks. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1364.18s)]
*  The combination of the election and our economic policies that people of Softbank, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1370.18s)]
*  one of the most brilliant anywhere in the world, announced a $200 billion investment. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1377.18s)]
*  OpenAI and Oracle, Larry Ellison, announced $500 billion investment, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1383.18s)]
*  which they wouldn't have done if Kamala had won. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1391.18s)]
*  Apple announced $500 billion investment. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1395.18s)]
*  Tim Cook called me. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1402.18s)]
*  He said, I cannot spend it fast enough. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1404.18s)]
*  It's going to be much higher than that, I believe. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1406.18s)]
*  They'll be building their plants here instead of in China. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1408.18s)]
*  And just yesterday, Taiwan, semiconductor, the biggest in the world, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1412.18s)]
*  most powerful in the world, has a tremendous amount, 97 percent of the market, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1417.18s)]
*  announced a $165 billion investment to build the most powerful chips on Earth right here in the USA. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1423.18s)]
*  And we're not giving them any money. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1443.18s)]
*  Your Chips Act is a horrible, horrible thing. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1445.18s)]
*  We give hundreds of billions of dollars, and it doesn't mean a thing. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1448.18s)]
*  They take our money and they don't spend it. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1452.18s)]
*  All that meant to them, we're giving them no money. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1455.18s)]
*  All that was important to them was they didn't want to pay the tariffs, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1459.18s)]
*  so they came and they're building, and many other companies are coming. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1462.18s)]
*  We don't have to give them money. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1465.18s)]
*  We just want to protect our businesses and our people, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1467.18s)]
*  and they will come because they won't have to pay tariffs if they build in America. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1470.18s)]
*  So it's very amazing. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1474.18s)]
*  You should get rid of the Chips Act and whatever's left over, Mr. Speaker. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1475.18s)]
*  You should use it to reduce debt or any other reason you want to. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1480.18s)]
*  Our new trade policy will also be great for the American farmer. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1486.18s)]
*  I love the farmer. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1491.18s)]
*  Who will now be selling into our home market, the USA, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1493.18s)]
*  because nobody is going to be able to compete with you. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1500.18s)]
*  Because the American farmer is going to be selling into our home market, the USA, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1504.18s)]
*  because nobody is going to be able to compete with you. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1511.18s)]
*  Because those goods that come in from other countries and companies, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1515.18s)]
*  they're really, really in a bad position in so many different ways. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1521.18s)]
*  They're uninspected. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1526.18s)]
*  They may be very dirty and disgusting, and they come in and they pour in, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1529.18s)]
*  and they hurt our American farmers. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1533.18s)]
*  The tariffs will go on. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1535.18s)]
*  The tariffs will go on. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1537.18s)]
*  Agricultural product coming into America and our farmers starting on April 2nd. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1538.18s)]
*  It may be a little bit of an adjustment period. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1543.18s)]
*  We had that before when I made the deal with China. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1546.18s)]
*  $50 billion of purchases. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1549.18s)]
*  And I said, just bear with me. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1551.18s)]
*  And they did. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1552.18s)]
*  They did. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1553.18s)]
*  Probably have to bear with me again. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1554.18s)]
*  And this will be even better. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1557.18s)]
*  That was great. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1558.18s)]
*  The problem with it was that Biden didn't enforce it. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1559.18s)]
*  He didn't enforce it. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1562.18s)]
*  $50 billion of purchases. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1563.18s)]
*  And we were doing great, but Biden did not enforce it. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1565.18s)]
*  And it hurt our farmers. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1568.18s)]
*  But our farmers are going to have a field day right now. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1570.18s)]
*  So to our farmers, have a lot of fun. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1573.18s)]
*  I love you, too. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1577.18s)]
*  I love you, too. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1578.18s)]
*  It's all going to happen. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1580.18s)]
*  And I have also imposed a 25 percent tariff on foreign aluminum, copper, lumber and steel, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1582.18s)]
*  because if we don't have, as an example, steel and lots of other things, we don't have a military [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1595.18s)]
*  and frankly won't have, we just won't have a country very long. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1602.18s)]
*  Here today is a proud American steelworker, fantastic person from Decatur, Alabama. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1606.18s)]
*  Jeff Dinnard has been working at the same steel plant for 27 years in a job that has allowed him to serve [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1614.18s)]
*  as the captain of his local volunteer fire department, raise seven children with his beautiful wife, Nicole, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1623.18s)]
*  and over the years, provide a loving home for more than 40 foster children. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1631.18s)]
*  So great Jeff. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1636.18s)]
*  Thank you, Jeff. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1638.18s)]
*  Stories like Jeff's remind us that tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1657.18s)]
*  They're about protecting the soul of our country. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1663.18s)]
*  Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again, and it's happening, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1668.18s)]
*  and it will happen rather quickly. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1673.18s)]
*  There'll be a little disturbance, but we're okay with that. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1675.18s)]
*  It won't be much. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1680.18s)]
*  No, you're not. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1682.18s)]
*  And look where Biden took us, very low, the lowest we've ever been. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1686.18s)]
*  Jeff, I want to thank you very much. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swkf_LrZSkU&t=1690.18s)]
