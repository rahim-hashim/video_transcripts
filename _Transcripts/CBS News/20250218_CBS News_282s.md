# New York governor considering removing Eric Adams as NYC mayor
**CBS News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M)
*  Let's go stateside now to New York where Governor Kathy Hokel could decide the fate of New York City Mayor Eric Adams. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=0.0s)]
*  This is a mess. Hokel is meeting with key leaders today to talk about what she calls a path forward. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=8.0s)]
*  After four top officials in Mr. Adams' administration walked, they resigned. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=13.0s)]
*  This is the latest fallout from the Justice Department move to drop corruption charges against Mr. Adams. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=18.0s)]
*  CBS News Department of Justice correspondent Scott McFarland joining us live. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=22.0s)]
*  Scott, we're also seeing federal prosecutors step down over this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=26.0s)]
*  They mean business. They are literally putting a foot in the door with the minutia of this story. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=31.0s)]
*  We understand now it's up to a judge to decide whether to dismiss the case. How could this play out? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=36.0s)]
*  You just characterized it as a mess, which is I think at this point an understatement now. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=43.0s)]
*  This has become a particularly nettlesome problem for this judge to try to unwind. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=48.0s)]
*  The Department of Justice in this unprecedented effort is trying to drop the corruption case against Eric Adams. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=55.0s)]
*  Part of their argument is that it's because the president wants Eric Adams' help in New York City [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=61.0s)]
*  to affect border security policies the president is putting forward. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=66.0s)]
*  That is not the reason traditionally given for dropping a criminal case. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=72.0s)]
*  Usually it has to do with the facts of the case shifting or some point of law. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=75.0s)]
*  This is a pure political motive and the judge has to figure out what to do about this [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=79.0s)]
*  because judges don't face this question before. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=84.0s)]
*  Should we drop a case or let a case go because the president could politically benefit from it happening? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=87.0s)]
*  The judge in this case will have hearings at 2 p.m. on the East Coast tomorrow. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=94.0s)]
*  The prosecution, the Department of Justice, will make its argument. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=98.0s)]
*  It's quite possible representatives for Eric Adams will make an argument, but there's also this variable. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=101.0s)]
*  As we watch the hearing unfold tomorrow, will a third party be heard? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=107.0s)]
*  Well, some representative of the people. There have been some private attorneys who have tried to file in this case. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=111.0s)]
*  Well, they say the case should go forward because the facts haven't changed. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=116.0s)]
*  And all the while you have a judge who no doubt is quite keen to the fact that if the ruling goes in a way [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=120.0s)]
*  that the president and his team do not like, there will be considerable blowback. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=127.0s)]
*  There's also word of another resignation at the DOJ making headlines. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=131.0s)]
*  Scott, the head of the Justice Department's Washington, D.C. criminal division, she says she's leaving the job. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=134.0s)]
*  What do we know about that? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=140.0s)]
*  Her name is Denise Chung. Not a household name, not a household position. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=141.0s)]
*  She is the head of the criminal prosecutions for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=147.0s)]
*  That sounds bureaucratic, but let me pledge to you. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=152.0s)]
*  When you run criminal prosecutions in the nation's capital for the federal government, you deal with the big things. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=154.0s)]
*  Terror cases, corruption cases, the things that are so weight bearing, they're filed in the nation's capital. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=160.0s)]
*  She is part of this broader set of resignations and retirements from top officials in the U.S. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=166.0s)]
*  Justice Department ever since Inauguration Day. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=172.0s)]
*  It's not a matter of if there's going to be a purge of the Department of Justice. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=175.0s)]
*  At this point now, Reid, it's a matter of how large a purge there's going to be, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=179.0s)]
*  how many people are going to walk away from what they don't view as acceptable. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=183.0s)]
*  Her resignation, Denise Chung, comes a day after the president announced [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=186.0s)]
*  he was going to nominate Ed Martin to be the U.S. Attorney here in Washington, D.C., to be her boss. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=190.0s)]
*  Ed the Eagle Martin, as he's nicknamed, was a stop the steal advocate, election denier, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=196.0s)]
*  who defended January 6th defendants and was put in place shortly after the inauguration [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=202.0s)]
*  and expedited the dropping of all those capital riot cases, viewed as a particularly ardent loyalist to MAGA. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=206.0s)]
*  Him being in charge of prosecutions in Washington, D.C., [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=214.0s)]
*  may not sit well with a lot of the longtime tenured members of that office. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=217.0s)]
*  Wow. Scott, we're also following a hearing today in Washington, D.C., [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=221.0s)]
*  over President Trump's order to ban transgender service members from the military. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=225.0s)]
*  Many members of the military, in fact friends of mine, want to know how this could play out. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=230.0s)]
*  What do you know so far? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=234.0s)]
*  You have this lawsuit brought by some of the impacted members of the service. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=236.0s)]
*  They have asked the judge here, a Biden-appointed judge named Anna Reyes, for a preliminary injunction [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=240.0s)]
*  that means hold off on this new policy involving transgender members of the military. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=246.0s)]
*  We're waiting for a ruling from the judge whether she does in fact order. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=250.0s)]
*  A preliminary injunction is part of what they're having a hearing about today, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=254.0s)]
*  but that's just a short-term remedy to a longer-term issue here. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=258.0s)]
*  The administration is going to try to plow ahead with this new policy, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=261.0s)]
*  no matter if a temporary pause is issued or not. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=265.0s)]
*  So we're looking at an early battle in a war that the Trump administration is very focused on winning. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=268.0s)]
*  Scott McFarland, thank you so much. It's almost like a master's degree a month from you. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=274.0s)]
*  We appreciate it. Live from Washington, D.C. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=279.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqF3j_mhk3M&t=281.0s)]
