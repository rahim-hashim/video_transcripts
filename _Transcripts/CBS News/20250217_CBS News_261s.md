# Some federal workers who oversee nuclear weapons laid off, asked to return
**CBS News:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg)
*  Federal employees who are in charge of nuclear weapons got the pink slip last week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=0.0s)]
*  It's all part of the Trump administration's massive wave of layoffs. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=6.0s)]
*  I'm talking about workers at the National Nuclear Security Administration. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=9.28s)]
*  We should note though, some of those workers are now being asked to come back to work. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=13.58s)]
*  So here are some of what the administration is tasked with doing. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=17.78s)]
*  They maintain the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=21.2s)]
*  They reduce global danger from weapons of mass destruction. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=23.7s)]
*  They also work hand in hand with the U.S. Navy and they respond to nuclear emergencies in the United States and abroad. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=27.76s)]
*  Here now from the Nuclear Threat Initiative is Scott Roker. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  And Scott, thank you so much for being with us today. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=39.84s)]
*  Can you talk more about what this agency oversees and some of its responsibilities? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=42.6s)]
*  Yeah, thank you so much for having me today. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=47.92s)]
*  As you mentioned, the primary mission of the NNSA is to maintain our nuclear weapons. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  But this has actually gotten more complicated in recent years with an effort to modernize them, which is a huge task, to say the least. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=57.0s)]
*  But perhaps less well known is the international engagement that they do to prevent nuclear terrorism, to also stop new countries from getting nuclear weapons. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=64.88s)]
*  There's approximately 200 federal employees that have these duties working in essentially every country in the globe to eliminate weapons usable nuclear material, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=75.16s)]
*  to secure the material that remains and also to protect that highly radioactive sources that could be used in a dirty bomb again, located in pretty much every country around the globe. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=84.4s)]
*  Wow, they do quite a lot. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=94.32s)]
*  Scott, we know that some of the workers at the agency were fired and then they were asked to come back. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=96.0s)]
*  So can you talk about what happened here? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=101.56s)]
*  And have you had any contact with some of those people affected by the layoffs? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=104.4s)]
*  Yes, yes, I have. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=109.56s)]
*  I know some of these people were actually working abroad when they were notified that they were fired. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=111.6s)]
*  They were out doing the agency's business around the globe. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  And let me tell you who these people are. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=119.32s)]
*  They're highly educated with advanced degrees. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=121.28s)]
*  They're passionate about what they do. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=124.36s)]
*  They love their jobs. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=125.76s)]
*  They're incredibly hardworking. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  They'll oftentimes miss weekends or holidays with families and friends because they want to make our country safe. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=128.48s)]
*  So these are really important jobs that are in direct service of our national security. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=134.84s)]
*  And the fire ratings, as has been reported, were arbitrary. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=141.04s)]
*  They're focusing on probationary period employees that were recently hired only because they're the easiest to fire. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=144.76s)]
*  So there wasn't like a decision made to cut a job or two or a mission. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=152.44s)]
*  It was very arbitrary, which makes it all the more confusing. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=157.48s)]
*  And Scott, just to follow up on that on that first question, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  some of those people that you know personally who were fired or laid off, have they been asked to come back? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=163.32s)]
*  I've not heard from everyone, but I understand that many of them have been asked to come back. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=169.84s)]
*  Whether they accept, it'll be interesting to see because certainly there's been trust lost. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=174.48s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=178.56s)]
*  And one more question for you here. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=180.16s)]
*  What are the potential ramifications of this massive layoffs at an agency like the Nuclear Security Administration? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=182.0s)]
*  Can you talk about the gravity of all this? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=188.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, certainly damage has been done. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=191.04s)]
*  This sent a shockwave through the agency. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=193.23999999999998s)]
*  And if they were to continue, we would really be ceding our global leadership to prevent a nuclear catastrophe. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=196.04s)]
*  Something that we're uniquely positioned to do because we have these highly capable federal employees, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=203.32s)]
*  because we have the national laboratory system across the United States, we've got labs in Tennessee, New Mexico, Washington state. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=209.12s)]
*  So there would be a significant vacuum that was left if the US sort of cedes its leadership in this area. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=216.16s)]
*  And it could make it more likely that a terrorist could obtain a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=222.68s)]
*  Our nuclear weapons would also be less reliable, which would be certainly a concern domestically, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=226.72s)]
*  but also for those countries that we've committed to protect. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  And this is all happening at a time when we need these jobs more than ever because of the modernization of the weapons program, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=234.04000000000002s)]
*  because we're expecting to see more nuclear energy in dozens of new countries to help combat climate change. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=240.76s)]
*  So at the very moment where we need these jobs all the more, firing would certainly be taking us in the wrong direction. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=247.12s)]
*  Scott Roker, thank you so much for putting all of this into perspective for us. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=254.8s)]
*  We appreciate your time today. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=258.52s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMyJiPp8Rg&t=260.36s)]
