# White House tells court Elon Musk is not part of DOGE
**CBS News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U)
*  The White House, as we indicated at the top, is sending what can only be described as mixed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=0.0s)]
*  signals about who is actually running the Department of Government Efficiency, DOJ. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=5.0s)]
*  A court filing late last night said that Elon Musk is not technically part of DOJ and actually [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=9.36s)]
*  serves as a senior advisor to the president, which means he may serve in that role longer [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  than originally articulated by the White House, which suggested it would be about a term of [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=22.36s)]
*  employment roughly six months. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  The White House press secretary was asked about this earlier today. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=29.24s)]
*  Elon Musk has been tasked with overseeing DOJ on behalf of the president and DOJ employees, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=33.4s)]
*  DOJ folks have been onboarding at respective agencies across our federal bureaucracy as [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=40.24s)]
*  political appointees, just like any other political appointee gets on board with the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=46.84s)]
*  new administration with the changing of hands. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=51.16s)]
*  Jake Rosen joins us now from our D.C. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=55.08s)]
*  Bureau. Jake, help the audience make sense of what this legal filing says and suggests [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=57.48s)]
*  about not only what Elon Musk's role is, what the duration of it might be. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=65.92s)]
*  Right. This filing came late last night in a case that was actually decided further on [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=71.08s)]
*  early later earlier today in which the government laid out the an affidavit from someone who [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  works in the executive branch of the White House, basically someone an administrative [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=81.32s)]
*  staffer who said that Elon Musk is just that, a senior White House adviser. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=84.4s)]
*  They compared him to Anita Dunn, who worked under President Biden as kind of an oversaw [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=89.08000000000001s)]
*  many buckets of government and many buckets of management within the White House. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=93.76s)]
*  They said that he has no formal administrative role over DOJ. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=97.48s)]
*  He has no formal administrative role over any part of what they're doing there and is [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=101.4s)]
*  certainly not the head of it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  This came because there's a lawsuit by over 18 states attorney general, all liberal, who [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=106.64000000000001s)]
*  sued the federal government, including Elon Musk, in his capacity as what they thought [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=112.12s)]
*  was head of DOJ and the Department of Government Efficiency, alleging that Elon Musk's role [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=116.0s)]
*  is unconstitutional. Now, obviously, this helped defend Elon Musk in this by basically [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=120.4s)]
*  saying it's not actually him. It's just a separate department in the government. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=124.76s)]
*  And Musk is an adviser to the president. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=128.04s)]
*  However, that does contradict really what we saw last week in the Oval Office between [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=129.76s)]
*  Trump and Elon Musk when Musk was there with his child. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  And they had that very contentious and controversial kind of press engagement. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  But really, it stemmed from from a lot of that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  And there's also this evolving conversation being conducted by the White House that in [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  this advisory capacity, it's really the heads of the various agencies that are making these [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  decisions on laying off federal workers, taking it out of Elon Musk, and they hope [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=154.16s)]
*  creating more legal protection for those layoffs themselves. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  Right. And the problem, though, Major, is that what a lot of these lawsuits that have [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  stemmed from these DOJ filings iterate, especially across over about a dozen lawsuits [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=168.16s)]
*  aimed at DOJ, is that especially the ones aimed at those employees who had been fired by [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=173.92s)]
*  Elon Musk's DOJ employees at these agencies, is that really nobody from the agencies knows [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=178.96s)]
*  who these people are. They usually come in and either take someone's badge away or they [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=183.48s)]
*  cut their access off. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=187.16s)]
*  And, you know, I think when you think about what Trump has said about Elon Musk's role in [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=189.32s)]
*  this, you know, yes, Trump is is the number one person who makes final decisions of the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=193.32s)]
*  White House. Right. But the way that Elon Musk has essentially conveyed his role in this [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=199.76s)]
*  entire situation is that he's the one personally responsible for these layoffs. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=204.2s)]
*  He and his team are doing X, he and his team are doing Y. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=207.88s)]
*  And that certainly, at least by what the White House admitted last night, is not the case. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  A stark distinction to what is said at podiums and what is said in a court of law. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=214.92s)]
*  That is a pattern somewhat familiar to those of us who've watched Donald Trump for many, many [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=219.64s)]
*  years. Jake Rosen, thank you very much. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7y0Oc0So9U&t=223.84s)]
