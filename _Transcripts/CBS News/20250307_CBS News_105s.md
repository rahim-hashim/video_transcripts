# South Carolina man executed via firing squad, first in 15 years
**CBS News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8)
*  A South Carolina inmate was executed via firing squad Friday evening, the first such execution [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=0.0s)]
*  in the United States in 15 years. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=6.36s)]
*  67-year-old Brad Sigmon chose to be killed by a firing squad, which was legalized in [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=8.92s)]
*  South Carolina in 2021. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=14.06s)]
*  However, lawyers representing Sigmon say he only chose that because of concerns regarding [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=16.0s)]
*  both lethal injection and the electric chair. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=20.36s)]
*  Sigmon was convicted in the 2001 murders of his ex-girlfriend's parents. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Meg Oliver joins us now from Columbia, South Carolina for more. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  And a warning for people, some of the details they may find disturbing. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  But Meg, how did this rare execution go? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=33.76s)]
*  So, Lindsay, it played out shortly after 6 o'clock with a hood over his head and a target [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=37.2s)]
*  over his heart. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  A firing squad executed Brad Sigmon. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=46.28s)]
*  He was pronounced dead at 6.08. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=49.64s)]
*  This is four years after the state of South Carolina's legislature approved this option [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=52.32s)]
*  for death row inmates. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=58.36s)]
*  Meg, what does this mean for future executions in South Carolina? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=60.36s)]
*  Right now, Lindsay, that we know that inmates have this option. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=68.2s)]
*  And now that it has been put out there, South Carolina is only the fifth state to include [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=74.4s)]
*  firing squads. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  The state of South Carolina maintains that this is not cruel and unusual punishment because [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=81.6s)]
*  they give death row inmates the option to choose. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=85.96s)]
*  If they don't make a choice among lethal injection, the electric chair, and now a firing squad, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=90.0s)]
*  the default is the electric chair. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=95.44s)]
*  Whether or not we are going to see more states follow suit remains to be seen at this point. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=98.32s)]
*  Meg Oliver, thank you. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3QR8Eq7hf8&t=103.63999999999999s)]
