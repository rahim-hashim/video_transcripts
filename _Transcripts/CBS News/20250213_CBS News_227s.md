# NATO allies warn Ukraine and Europe can't be left out of peace talks with Russia
**CBS News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I)
*  NATO allies are warning this morning that Ukraine and Europe must not be left out of any peace talks [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=0.0s)]
*  after President Trump's surprise announcement yesterday that he and Russian leader Vladimir [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=5.44s)]
*  Putin have agreed to start negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. Arriving at the NATO Defense [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=9.6s)]
*  Minister's meeting in Brussels today, the US Defense Secretary denied claims the US is turning [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  its back on Ukraine. There is no betrayal there. There is a recognition that the whole world and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=21.6s)]
*  the United States is invested and interested in peace, a negotiated peace, as President Trump has [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=28.56s)]
*  said, stopping the killing. Joining us now for more on this is CBS News national security [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=35.28s)]
*  correspondent Charlie Dagata in our DC bureau. Charlie, NATO has held that there should be a [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=41.68s)]
*  united front against Russia in its war in Ukraine. So how is this new US position under Trump being [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=47.28s)]
*  received by the United States? Well, Errol, I'll be honest with you, opinions are divided, you know, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  which in itself is no good thing. Most European partners are in agreement, as we've already [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=58.0s)]
*  reported, that Ukraine should not only have a say in any negotiations going forward, it should be [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=62.8s)]
*  led in the negotiations going forward. But the NATO secretary general has tried to pull the alliance [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=69.04s)]
*  together, saying, look, we all want peace in Ukraine. We all want Ukraine to be in the best [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=74.48s)]
*  possible position. But as you said, many were stunned to hear that President Trump had that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=79.92s)]
*  lengthy phone call with President Putin. Russian officials say that that phone call went on for [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=85.2s)]
*  more than an hour. Both the president and the defense secretary have already said that Ukraine [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  will have to make some concessions. That has caused some ruffles, giving up on any idea of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  like reclaiming territory taken over by Russia and Russian separatists. Most importantly, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=99.2s)]
*  that area around eastern Ukraine and Crimea, that's always been a bargaining chip in future [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  negotiations, not given up before the negotiations have even begun. So I think the real concern here [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=110.88s)]
*  is that Ukraine and Europe are not sidelined by negotiations between the United States and Russia. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=116.56s)]
*  And what's noteworthy is speaking at Brussels yesterday, Secretary Hegseth said, among other [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  sticking points, that any peacekeeping force potentially deployed to Ukraine should be part of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=127.52s)]
*  a non-NATO mission. Let's just play that clip for our viewers. Any security guarantee must be backed [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=132.4s)]
*  by capable European and non-European troops. If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=139.04s)]
*  Ukraine at any point, they should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission. To be clear, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=146.72s)]
*  as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=152.72s)]
*  What does that mean? How would that work? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=159.92s)]
*  Well, you couldn't have been more emphatic. It's a good question. There is some limited [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  precedence for European forces as peacekeepers in places like Bosnia, but nothing on this scale. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=168.0s)]
*  But you could see something where countries like the U.K., which they've already said, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=174.32s)]
*  they may take the lead. But the reason the defense secretary said that are twofold. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=177.68s)]
*  First of all, President Putin has tried to justify the invasion of Ukraine [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=181.68s)]
*  as an effort to stop NATO expansion, certainly to stop Ukraine from joining NATO. So if you've [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=185.68s)]
*  got NATO forces as part of a peacekeeping force, they'll literally be on the border with Russia, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=190.48s)]
*  which is something Putin is not likely to accept in any kind of peace negotiations. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=195.76s)]
*  Then, of course, the ramifications of having NATO troops in Ukrainian territory say there [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=199.92s)]
*  are flare-ups, which there always are. Then you have NATO allies right in the firing line. Simply [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=203.84s)]
*  put, Article 5, right, that means an attack on one nation is an attack on all. So, theoretically, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=208.88s)]
*  U.S. forces could see themselves drawn into a fight in defense of its allies, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=213.76s)]
*  directly engaging in a war with Russia. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=220.88s)]
*  All right, Charlie, we appreciate your reporting this morning. Thank you. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMwpa682y8I&t=222.88s)]
