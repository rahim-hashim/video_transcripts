# Latest weather forecast as California winds weaken
**CBS News:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc)
*  our let's take our monitors back to the US, though still a threat. Winds [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=0.0s)]
*  continue to weaken today in Southern California, giving crews another [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=4.0s)]
*  opening to fight the deadly wildfires burning in Los Angeles County. Day by [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=8.24s)]
*  day, we're seeing some evacuation orders get lifted in affected areas, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=12.8s)]
*  even as tens of thousands still wait to go home. Now there are new worries. The [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=17.6s)]
*  air quality and safety for those returning to their homes. The L. A [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=22.6s)]
*  County Sheriff Robert Luna this morning emphasized the importance of residents [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=26.72s)]
*  staying out of these areas or face serious consequences. Take a listen for [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=31.04s)]
*  the L. A County Sheriff's area. Our total is at 47. We have 36 at the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  Eaton incident and 11 at the Palisades incident. Palisades increased by [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=43.68s)]
*  several last night, 3 36 or I'm sorry, Eaton did not increase the arrests that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  were we continue to see. And I wanted just a point of clarification for our [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=56.6s)]
*  community members. One is I talk about curfew, which takes place from 6 p.m. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=60.88s)]
*  to 6 a.m. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  There is a another penal code that we use during the day because if you are [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  not supposed to be in an evacuation order area and a law enforcement [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=75.72s)]
*  officer, deputy sheriff, CHP officer, LAPD, whoever it is, tells you to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=80.92s)]
*  leave and you refuse to leave, you are subject to arrest during the day as [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=85.88000000000001s)]
*  well. I just want to clarify that again, if you do not have any legitimate [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=91.2s)]
*  business day or night, do not go. You are subject to arrest. Uh, regarding [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  search and rescue operations, my other partners that have come before me, I [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  think we're making it pretty clear that there are multiple reasons why we cannot [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=108.88s)]
*  let people in yet. Yes, we're trying to work towards that. I'm gonna say it's [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=113.96s)]
*  probably at least a week out. You've heard that already. Our search and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=120.36s)]
*  rescue operations continue in both the Eaton and Palisades area. Uh, searches [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=124.55999999999999s)]
*  are continuing and we still have a variety of work and structures to go [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=131.72s)]
*  through. But even as we're going through some of these grids, there are areas [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=138.12s)]
*  that we are holding because we believe there may be deceased victims there. We [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=143.76s)]
*  have to hold for the right time and the right resources to process the scene [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=151.28s)]
*  correctly. Uh, and that's gonna take a little while. Please be patient with us. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=156.6s)]
*  We know people want to get back into their neighborhoods, but we're talking [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=163.12s)]
*  about people who have passed. Um, and that's not always a good thing to talk [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=166.57999999999998s)]
*  about in regards to deaths. Unfortunately. All right, let's go now [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=171.6s)]
*  to CBS News correspondent Elise Preston. They're in Alta Dena close to the Eaton [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=176.48s)]
*  fire. Elise, you know, I noticed you're wearing a mask there even for those who [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=180.92s)]
*  are able to go back to their home and they don't have major damage. They're [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=186.84s)]
*  still gonna have to wait to go back to their homes. And the big reason for that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=191.04s)]
*  is the toxic chemicals and smoke in the air. You're in Alta Dena where this is [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=195.04s)]
*  a big issue. Can you tell us a little bit about what you are experiencing [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=201.2s)]
*  and what you're saying? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=205.28s)]
*  Well, uh, it heavy. It's link. We're coughing a lot. We're drinking a lot of [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  water, which I feel like adds a little bit of a relief. But I also want to go [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=213.92s)]
*  back to what officials are saying. They're also not clearing these areas [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=217.45999999999998s)]
*  because they're still sifting through this rubble looking for people who have [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=221.39999999999998s)]
*  passed. Liz, we know that more than two dozen people have passed in these [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=226.28s)]
*  fires. The Eaton fire is seeing the largest amount of victims who have been [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=231.4s)]
*  killed in the fires. And so we have seen crews going throughout the area. It's a [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=236.28s)]
*  very somber tone. Those crews that are looking for people in the rubble, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=242.36s)]
*  they're all volunteers, which I think is incredible. They are trying to find [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=247.16s)]
*  people. They're trying to reunite families. We've spoken to some families, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=253.0s)]
*  you know, and they just want answers as to what happened to their loved ones. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=257.16s)]
*  Should they still be looking elsewhere? Should they be holding out hope? Maybe [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=261.48s)]
*  their person, you know, escaped and they are safe. They just haven't been able to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=267.24s)]
*  contact them. That's what some of the relatives are asking. So I think it's [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=271.4s)]
*  incredible that these volunteers who are working so hard to try to get these [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=276.32s)]
*  missing families some answers. They're volunteers and I can't even imagine, you [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=282.79999999999995s)]
*  know, what they're going through, what they're seeing as they're trying to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=289.32s)]
*  answer those questions. Yes, that's an amazing point there. At least when you [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=293.28s)]
*  think about the task of going through that rubble and it has to be, it's [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  heartbreaking. It's also very tedious. And in many cases, unfortunately, you [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=301.91999999999996s)]
*  have to make that call that they discovered that an individuals of loved [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=306.32s)]
*  one who didn't make it out of that fire. I want to pivot here for a moment [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=310.68s)]
*  because as people start to return to their home, some of them were able to [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  return to their homes and sort of think about rebuilding multiple lawsuits are [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=318.91999999999996s)]
*  already coming out against some power companies. Now we're still working to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=323.56s)]
*  find out the causes of these fires, but can you break down those lawsuits [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=327.68s)]
*  against the power companies? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=332.0s)]
*  Yeah, so the plaintiffs in the lawsuits alleged that the power companies did [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=335.68s)]
*  not do enough when it comes to public safety. And so they're going after the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=340.56s)]
*  power companies saying that a you didn't clear the brush around your lines. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=345.08s)]
*  They're saying that they didn't cut the lines soon enough on that they didn't [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=350.6s)]
*  necessarily take into account all of the factors that were going in. And so [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=355.0s)]
*  as a result of those actions, these plaintiffs are saying that the power [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=360.16s)]
*  companies blame regardless of all these other elements there, you know, they [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=364.68s)]
*  acknowledge that the wind was unprecedented. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=369.56s)]
*  We've gotten messages from those power companies SCE. So Southern California [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=375.15999999999997s)]
*  Edison, we spoke with them and they're saying, number one, we haven't even been [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=382.47999999999996s)]
*  able to get to our transmission lines because it's not safe. As you know, a [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=387.91999999999996s)]
*  lot of this area is still cordoned off. So they said that they haven't been able [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=392.91999999999996s)]
*  to get to their transmission lines to see what exactly happened. But from what [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=397.12s)]
*  their data, from what they've been able to see from satellite images, they're [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=401.56s)]
*  saying that there weren't any anomalies in the in the wire and in the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=405.8s)]
*  transmission of the wire the night that these fires erupted last Tuesday. And [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=411.04s)]
*  then the fire companies are also saying that they have done everything by the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=415.96s)]
*  book by these fire mitigation plans that are updated every year based on [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=420.32s)]
*  California state law and their procedures. So the fire or excuse me, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=427.08s)]
*  the utility companies are saying that to their knowledge, they've done [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=432.8s)]
*  everything, but they also cannot answer that question for certain until they're [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=436.44s)]
*  able to actually examine their transmission lines and see what [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=441.32s)]
*  happened. There's a lot of investigations that are unfolding right [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=444.76s)]
*  now. All right, CBS News correspondent Elise Preston in Alta Dina for us. Thank [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=448.0s)]
*  you so much, Elise. Let's bring in just down. She talked a little bit about the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=452.03999999999996s)]
*  winds that were playing into the spread of these fires and massive destruction [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=456.76s)]
*  there and fire crews were dealing with it yesterday, but it sounds like [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=461.38s)]
*  hopefully those very dangerous conditions are winding down a little [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=464.8s)]
*  bit significantly. I mean, you take a look at the winds just yesterday where [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=468.64s)]
*  we were still forecasting up to around 50 60 mile per hour winds widespread [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=472.14s)]
*  throughout those hills and those mountains. Now it's really starting to [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=476.12s)]
*  isolate itself as the Santa Ana winds start to die down. This is the chapter [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=479.0s)]
*  turn as we head into the next couple days, we're going to continue to see [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=482.64s)]
*  lighter winds, higher relative humidity. That's just all great news across the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=485.76s)]
*  board. But there are still some red flag warnings issued for the San [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=489.4s)]
*  Gabriel Mountains or at least the western ones all the way over into the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=493.36s)]
*  Santa Monica Mountains. We're starting to see a lot more improvement. We zoom [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=496.24s)]
*  into these communities and these local areas could still see up to around 40 50 [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=499.52s)]
*  mile per hour wind gust, but this only lasts until around three o'clock. The [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=504.59999999999997s)]
*  time now over in California is 9 26. We're gonna continue to watch this [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=507.88s)]
*  improve into the overnight hours tonight and then we're actually gonna [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=511.88s)]
*  get some pacific breeze once again. Now the California coastline, they're used [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=514.68s)]
*  to getting that nice pacific breeze allowing for higher relative humidity [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=518.24s)]
*  and it's usually relatively light when it comes to those wind gusts. They're [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=521.64s)]
*  gonna get that into the overnight hours tonight with gusts dying down anywhere [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=524.88s)]
*  up to around 5 to 10 miles per hour into our friday forecast heading into [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=528.1999999999999s)]
*  sunday two or saturday and sunday two. Now that's gonna help a lot when it [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=532.0s)]
*  comes to the containment of these fires. But another key ingredient for why the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=535.8s)]
*  National Weather Service issues these red flag warnings has to do with [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=539.28s)]
*  relative humidity. And as we head into the overnight hours tonight, we finally [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=542.64s)]
*  get that good overnight recovery process that we're used to. We'll watch [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=546.28s)]
*  it jump up to around 75% in the same communities that have experienced about [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=550.4s)]
*  5% just earlier this week. So our fire weather outlook for the time being [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZe7LyGq9Qc&t=554.28s)]
