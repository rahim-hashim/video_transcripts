# How Trump's tariffs are a political tool
**CBS News:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U)
*  President Trump is signing an executive order placing a 25 percent tariff on all steel and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=0.0s)]
*  aluminum imports coming into the United States. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  He also says additional tariffs will come in the days ahead. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=8.28s)]
*  I'll be announcing probably Tuesday or Wednesday at a news conference reciprocal tariffs and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=11.48s)]
*  very simply it's if they charge us we charge them. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=17.72s)]
*  That's all. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=21.28s)]
*  When is it going to be in effect sir? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=22.28s)]
*  Almost immediately but I'll be announcing the details of it, highly detailed and it'll [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=23.44s)]
*  be great for everybody including the other countries. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=28.88s)]
*  But if they are charging us 130 percent and we're charging them nothing it's not going [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=32.36s)]
*  to stay that way. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=37.6s)]
*  This comes as new CBS News polling shows that 53 percent of Americans approve of the job [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=39.48s)]
*  the president has done in his first few weeks in office. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=44.8s)]
*  Many people feel he is doing more than they expected and describe the president as tough, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  energetic and focused since taking office. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  70 percent of those polled say he's delivering on what he said on the campaign trail while [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=55.44s)]
*  three out of ten people say things are different than he promised. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=59.72s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang for more on this. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=63.64s)]
*  Weijia, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=67.6s)]
*  I want to talk about these tariffs okay because President Trump is signing a 25 percent trade [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=69.96s)]
*  tariffs on steel and aluminum and is expected to set into motion additional reciprocal trade [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=74.6s)]
*  tariffs tomorrow or Wednesday. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=80.36s)]
*  What more do we know right now? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=82.6s)]
*  Well you're absolutely right we're expecting two separate executive orders on tariffs the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=85.08000000000001s)]
*  first being on any imports of steel and aluminum into the U.S. and of course U.S. steelworkers [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=89.4s)]
*  welcome this because the idea is that companies will not want to purchase from other nations [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=95.64s)]
*  that now have this additional 25 percent fee attached to it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=101.68s)]
*  It's important to note that the biggest exports of steel and aluminum to our country include [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=105.64000000000001s)]
*  some of our closest allies Canada, Mexico, Brazil, South Korea and Vietnam and so those [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  are the countries that will likely be impacted the most but we are waiting for that official [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  executive order signing and the resulting text of the order so we can know a little [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  bit more about the details and then separately the president says he will announce a retaliatory [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=128.24s)]
*  tariff on any tariff that already the U.S. faces from another countries because he says [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=133.76s)]
*  he wants to level the playing field of course this is nothing new the president used this [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=140.88s)]
*  tactic during his first term and he's already imposed a 10 percent tariff on several Chinese [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=145.92s)]
*  goods as well Kelly. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  It's important to note that politically he believes that this is a tool to get you know [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=154.72s)]
*  things that he wants concessions that he believes is important to the U.S. as an example when [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  it comes to Canada. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  In Mexico he was proposing a broader tariff on all the imports there unless they did more [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=166.32s)]
*  to curb migration and the illegal flow of migrants at both the northern and southern [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=171.4s)]
*  border and after they said that they would take more actions he put those tariffs on [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=177.12s)]
*  pause Kelly so he really views this as a tool to get frankly what he wants politically. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=183.16s)]
*  Yeah and actually I want to underscore the point that you made about U.S. steel because [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=190.16s)]
*  of course we have that whole Nippon and U.S. steel investment deal brewing and so there [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=195.4s)]
*  is the argument that that could actually help that industry here in the U.S. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=201.72000000000003s)]
*  Before I let you go though I just want to switch gears a little bit because a federal [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=206.28s)]
*  judge in Boston is weighing whether the Trump administration's plan to buy out thousands [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=209.24s)]
*  of federal employees contract is legal. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=214.24s)]
*  What is the administration saying about that effort? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=217.28000000000003s)]
*  Well the administration says it absolutely is legal and that the main concern that they [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=221.0s)]
*  will not be able to fulfill their financial part of the bargain is not valid so you're [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=226.16s)]
*  right the judge actually paused this order last week and imposed a new deadline which [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=232.88s)]
*  is tonight at midnight. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=237.88s)]
*  More than 65,000 federal workers have already accepted this deal and that's more than 3% [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=239.96s)]
*  of the government workforce. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=245.28s)]
*  So the judge said he wanted to learn more about the merits in this case so this afternoon [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=247.76s)]
*  we expect both sides to be arguing on the legality of this and then he could issue a [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=257.32s)]
*  new ruling but basically critics are sounding the alarm saying look you cannot use that [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=263.12s)]
*  money because it was for people to do work not for people to go home and be on leave [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=269.48s)]
*  and that is one of the major points of contention here Kelly. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=275.28s)]
*  Really interesting insight we Jen as you said that deadline is coming up tonight we will [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=279.0s)]
*  be watching thank you. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8cVxMNjk6U&t=282.35999999999996s)]
