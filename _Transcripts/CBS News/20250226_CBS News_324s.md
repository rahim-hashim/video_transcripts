# What we know about Trump's rare minerals deal with Ukraine's Zelenskyy
**CBS News:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY)
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is coming to the White House on Friday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=0.0s)]
*  That's according to President Trump. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=3.64s)]
*  The visit comes as the U.S. finalizes a deal with Ukraine to access its rare minerals. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=4.96s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Remy Nascencio joins me now from our London bureau to talk [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=9.76s)]
*  more about this. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=14.24s)]
*  Remy, this is sort of interesting. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=15.72s)]
*  I mean, it's not as if the United States, throughout the course of its 250-year history, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=19.44s)]
*  has not exploited other countries for their natural resources in exchange for perhaps [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=24.88s)]
*  protection or in exchange for arms or what have you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=29.84s)]
*  But Zelensky has been sort of pushing back on this minerals deal, but then something [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=36.2s)]
*  changed. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=40.64s)]
*  What was that? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=41.64s)]
*  Hey, Vlad. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=42.64s)]
*  Yeah, good to see you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=43.64s)]
*  Well, it seems like Ukraine maybe got a better deal. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=44.64s)]
*  And I say seems because key details haven't been made public just yet. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=48.2s)]
*  Let me throw out one number to start this all off. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=53.22s)]
*  $500 billion. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=56.02s)]
*  And that was the demand from Trump, that Ukraine give the U.S. $500 billion, half a trillion [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=57.74s)]
*  dollars here, in profits from the sale of its minerals. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=64.06s)]
*  Zelensky, though, we know that he said that that was too much. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=67.62s)]
*  So we might infer at least that that number is lower. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  Now, Trump had claimed the U.S. gave $350 billion in aid to Ukraine in the past three [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=72.46000000000001s)]
*  years. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=78.9s)]
*  The government watchdog has calculated that at something about half of that, $183 billion. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=80.10000000000001s)]
*  All this to say is that we started out with $500 billion to $350 billion to $183 billion. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=85.10000000000001s)]
*  The price tag for Ukraine has come down. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=90.94000000000001s)]
*  And we know, Vlad, right, this is Trump's MO, his modus operandi, to start high and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  then to negotiate. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=97.98s)]
*  The details still have yet to drop, but we can expect, we can infer that this deal has [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=99.18s)]
*  been made at least a little bit more palatable by Ukraine with the cost. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=104.62s)]
*  Look, this is, I mean, if you are a student of world history, as I say, you will have [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=109.62s)]
*  seen this playbook before. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=114.54s)]
*  The problem is, oftentimes, when these countries exploit smaller, weaker countries for their [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=116.34s)]
*  natural resources and they bleed them dry, then those countries are at risk themselves [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=121.5s)]
*  of becoming failed states. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=126.86000000000001s)]
*  This has happened. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=128.06s)]
*  Rami, you've been a foreign correspondent longer than I have. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=129.06s)]
*  You've seen this in the stories that you've reported all around the world. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=132.22s)]
*  So the question is, how is the U.S. preparing for the fact that this might have real-world [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=135.5s)]
*  problems and issues for Ukrainians, even if there's peace achieved between the Russians [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=141.14s)]
*  and the Ukrainians? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=146.92s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=148.42s)]
*  The phrase that Al-Farhat, listening to that, is you deal with the devil you do and the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=149.42s)]
*  devil that you don't and the devil you don't want to. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=155.78s)]
*  And in this case, the choice is being made by Vladimir Zelensky and the Kiev government, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=158.38000000000002s)]
*  whether they want to go and give in and to, let's say, lose the war with Russia or to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=164.14000000000001s)]
*  deal with Trump and to say, we will make this deal, maybe not whatever you ask, but come [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=170.62s)]
*  to some kind of negotiated terms, which appears to be what's happened here, in order to get [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  to this state where we are. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=182.72000000000003s)]
*  So, we're going to trade profits for, for example, titanium, which Ukraine has one of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=185.94s)]
*  Europe's biggest reserves and used in aircraft, missiles, lithium, another mineral of which [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=191.18s)]
*  Ukraine has perhaps one of Europe's largest reserves as well, graphite, which is an industrial [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=198.58s)]
*  lubricant, rare earths. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=204.54000000000002s)]
*  Earlier, we had a graphic up on the screen, a map. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=206.54000000000002s)]
*  I wonder if we could put that up there. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=209.26s)]
*  And I talk about this. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=211.22s)]
*  Look to the right side of your screen, and there's a swath of red where Russian-occupied [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=213.66s)]
*  Ukraine is. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=218.7s)]
*  And you can see that that red swath is a massive deposit of rare earth materials, but half [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=219.7s)]
*  of that also is controlled by Russia. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=225.33999999999997s)]
*  So this also is a problem, is a dilemma for Ukraine in terms of dealing with whatever [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=228.22s)]
*  minerals deal that they want to do with the United States, that some of it is controlled [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=234.85999999999999s)]
*  by Russia and the rest of it the U.S. potentially wants. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=239.14s)]
*  And, Rami, really quickly, is the NATO, at least the path to pursuing NATO citizenship [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=242.82s)]
*  off the table, even if Ukraine agrees to this deal? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=248.66s)]
*  It appears that, well, it appears that there has been no movement on that, let's say. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=253.01999999999998s)]
*  Of course, President Volodymyr Zelensky still wants that to happen. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=259.65999999999997s)]
*  Putin saying that he does not want that to happen at all. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=264.3s)]
*  The United States, President Trump, not being clear, being vague on what that could be. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=268.34s)]
*  But Ukraine, whether it's inside NATO or being outside of NATO, wants a security guarantee [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=275.5s)]
*  from the United States. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=281.98s)]
*  And if not the U.S., then at least some kind of Western security guarantee. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=283.74s)]
*  And to your question, Vlad, that alludes to potentially NATO, or let's say parts of NATO, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=288.82s)]
*  if the bloc were to hold up over the next few months. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=294.34s)]
*  It appears that that security guarantee has not been resolved. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=297.14s)]
*  So looking ahead, we're waiting to see really that phrase or that lack thereof. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=299.7s)]
*  But one belief is that tying the U.S., the U.S. economy to Ukraine's economy through [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=306.21999999999997s)]
*  this minerals deal could in fact make that security guarantee, whether it's official [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=311.38s)]
*  or not, at least a de facto reality. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=315.26s)]
*  All right, Rami Nascencio, breaking it down for us in ways only he can. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=318.34s)]
*  Thank you, my friend. Appreciate it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxro0RtxiY&t=322.3s)]
