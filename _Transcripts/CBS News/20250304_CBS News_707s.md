# Trump asks Congress to criminalize "sex changes on children" and for a "Golden Dome" defense shield
**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY)
*  Joining us at the gallery tonight is a young man who truly loves our police. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=0.0s)]
*  His name is DJ Daniel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=6.12s)]
*  He is 13 years old, and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  But in 2018, DJ was diagnosed with brain cancer. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=42.88s)]
*  The doctors gave him five months at most to live. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=57.28s)]
*  That was more than six years ago. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=61.88s)]
*  Since that time, DJ and his dad have been on a quest to make his dream come true, and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=86.36s)]
*  DJ has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer actually a number of times. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=92.52s)]
*  The police love him. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=100.44s)]
*  The police departments love him. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=101.76s)]
*  And tonight, DJ, we're going to do you the biggest honor of them all. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=103.84s)]
*  I am asking our new Secret Service Director, Sean Curran, to officially make you an agent [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=108.44s)]
*  of the United States Secret Service. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=115.54s)]
*  Thank you, DJ. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=145.54s)]
*  DJ's doctors believe his cancer likely came from a chemical he was exposed to when he [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=167.39999999999998s)]
*  was younger. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=172.44s)]
*  Since 1975, rates of child cancer have increased by more than 40 percent. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=174.2s)]
*  Reversing this trend is one of the top priorities for our new presidential commission to make [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=181.5s)]
*  America healthy again, chaired by our new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=194.22s)]
*  With the name Kennedy, you would have thought everybody over here would have been cheering. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=195.22s)]
*  How quickly they forget. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=221.86s)]
*  Our goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=224.94s)]
*  children healthy and strong. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=231.62s)]
*  As an example, not long ago, and you can't even believe these numbers, one in 10,000 [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=234.34s)]
*  children had autism. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=243.26s)]
*  One in 10,000. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=245.06s)]
*  And now it's one in 36. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=247.18s)]
*  There's something wrong. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=250.34s)]
*  One in 36. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=251.38s)]
*  Think of that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=252.46s)]
*  So we're going to find out what it is, and there's nobody better than Bobby and all [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=253.86s)]
*  of the people that are working with you. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=257.42s)]
*  You have the best to figure out what is going on. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=259.3s)]
*  Okay, Bobby, good luck. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=263.74s)]
*  It's a very important job. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=265.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=266.26s)]
*  Good job. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=267.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=279.26s)]
*  My administration is also working to protect our children from toxic ideologies in our [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=280.62s)]
*  schools. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=285.82s)]
*  A few years ago, January, little John and her husband discovered that their daughter's [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=286.82s)]
*  school had secretly socially transitioned their 13-year-old little girl. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=292.53999999999996s)]
*  Teachers and administrators conspired to deceive January and her husband while encouraging [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=299.18s)]
*  her daughter to use a new name and pronouns. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=304.53999999999996s)]
*  A-them pronoun, actually. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=309.21999999999997s)]
*  All without telling January, who is here tonight and is now a courageous advocate against this [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=311.86s)]
*  form of child abuse. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=318.18s)]
*  January, thank you. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=319.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=321.74s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=323.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=325.74s)]
*  Stories like this are why, shortly after taking office, I signed an executive order banning [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=340.06s)]
*  public schools from indoctrinating our children with transgender ideology. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=344.86s)]
*  I also signed an order to cut off all taxpayer funding to any institution that engages in [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=351.58s)]
*  the sexual mutilation of our youth. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=365.97999999999996s)]
*  And now I want Congress to pass a bill permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes on children [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=370.22s)]
*  and forever ending the lie that any child is trapped in the wrong body. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=383.66s)]
*  This is a big lie. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=389.74s)]
*  And our message to every child in America is that you are perfect exactly the way God [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=391.74s)]
*  made you. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=404.06s)]
*  Because we're getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military and it's already [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=406.06s)]
*  out and it's out of our society. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=424.06s)]
*  We don't want it. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=426.86s)]
*  Wokeness is trouble. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=428.98s)]
*  Wokeness is bad. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=430.78s)]
*  It's gone. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=431.78s)]
*  It's gone. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=432.78s)]
*  And we feel so much better for it, don't we? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=434.58s)]
*  Don't we feel better? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=436.97999999999996s)]
*  Our service members won't be activists and ideologues. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=438.82s)]
*  They will be fighters and warriors. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=447.06s)]
*  They will fight for our country. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=448.86s)]
*  And Pete, congratulations. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=451.38s)]
*  Secretary of Defense, congratulations. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=452.38s)]
*  And he's not big into the woke movement, I can tell you. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=453.38s)]
*  I know him well. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=469.82s)]
*  I am pleased to report that in January the U.S. Army had its single best recruiting month [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=471.65999999999997s)]
*  years and that all armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever in [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=477.54s)]
*  the history of our services. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=483.90000000000003s)]
*  What a difference. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=486.90000000000003s)]
*  And you know it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=491.90000000000003s)]
*  We couldn't recruit anywhere. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=501.62s)]
*  We couldn't recruit. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=503.70000000000005s)]
*  Now we're having the best results just about that we've ever had. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=505.46s)]
*  What a tremendous turnaround. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=510.41999999999996s)]
*  It's really a beautiful thing to see. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=513.06s)]
*  People love our country again. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=515.74s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=516.9s)]
*  They love our country and they love being in our military again. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=518.02s)]
*  So it's a great thing. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=521.52s)]
*  And thank you very much. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=522.52s)]
*  Great job. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=523.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=524.52s)]
*  We're joined tonight by a young man, Jason Hartley, who knows the weight of that call [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=525.52s)]
*  of duty. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=539.16s)]
*  Jason's father, grandfather, and great grandfather all wore the uniform. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=540.16s)]
*  Jason tragically lost his dad, who was also a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy when [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=545.88s)]
*  he was just a boy and now he wants to carry on the family legacy of service. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=552.66s)]
*  Jason is a senior in high school, a six-letter varsity athlete, a really good athlete they [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=558.52s)]
*  say, a brilliant student with a 4.46 GPA and his greatest dream is to attend the U.S. Military [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=563.64s)]
*  Academy at West Point. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=574.4s)]
*  And Jason, that's a very big deal getting in. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=578.8399999999999s)]
*  And that's a hard one to get into. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=602.86s)]
*  But I'm pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=604.94s)]
*  You will soon be joining the Corps of Cadets. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=610.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=632.86s)]
*  Jason, you're going to be on the long gray line, Jason. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=637.86s)]
*  As Commander-in-Chief, my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=649.26s)]
*  As a first step, I'm asking Congress to fund a state-of-the-art Golden Dome Missile Defense [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=654.98s)]
*  to protect our homeland, all made in the USA. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=661.34s)]
*  Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology just wasn't there, not even [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=668.34s)]
*  close. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=681.5s)]
*  But now we have the technology. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=682.5s)]
*  It's incredible, actually. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=683.5s)]
*  And other places have it. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=685.76s)]
*  Israel has it. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=687.74s)]
*  Other places have it. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=688.98s)]
*  And the United States should have it, too. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=691.46s)]
*  Right, Tim? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=693.66s)]
*  Right? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=694.66s)]
*  They should have it, too. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=695.66s)]
*  So I want to thank you. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=696.66s)]
*  But it's a very, very important — this is a very dangerous world. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=697.66s)]
*  We should have it. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=701.84s)]
*  We want to be protected, and we're going to protect our citizens like never before. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4o6IY-IiY&t=702.84s)]
