# Can ICE arrest immigrants at schools and churches?
**CBS News:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM)
*  So we are watching the impacts of President Donald Trump's executive orders on deportation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=0.0s)]
*  So today the focus is on whether ICE agents can arrest people in places like churches [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=4.32s)]
*  and schools and hospitals. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=9.26s)]
*  Prior to today deemed safe spaces. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=11.84s)]
*  So let's go live to CBS News correspondent Andres Gutierrez. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=13.96s)]
*  Andres, you went to those church leaders who are hearing from their congregants. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=16.6s)]
*  They are afraid. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=20.84s)]
*  What are they saying? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=21.84s)]
*  Yeah, good to be with you, Reid. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=23.56s)]
*  So I spent Tuesday evening at the Emmanuel Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles where [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=25.98s)]
*  the pastor told me that there is so much anxiety among members of the congregation over deportations [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=30.3s)]
*  and the fact that ICE could be showing up at churches and schools, places that were [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=35.9s)]
*  at one point thought to be off limits. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=40.14s)]
*  Over the last year, the church has hosted six families from Venezuela, Honduras and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=43.14s)]
*  Ecuador for about two to three months, although they can find some stable housing here in [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=47.7s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=51.980000000000004s)]
*  And on Tuesday night, the church ended up holding a prayer vigil to encourage folks [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=53.980000000000004s)]
*  to stay strong and to be informed about their rights. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=58.46s)]
*  The pastor applauded the remarks that that bishop told President Trump during that prayer [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=61.660000000000004s)]
*  service on Tuesday to have mercy on undocumented immigrants. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=65.82000000000001s)]
*  He said that there are several folks in this community that are fearful of deportation, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=69.54s)]
*  that these refugees are fleeing political repression, violence and gangs and sending [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=74.34s)]
*  them back to those conditions would be unthinkable. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=79.98s)]
*  Well, and you have to think of the children. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=83.74000000000001s)]
*  I'm remembering the interview that Tom Holman did with CBS a couple of months ago when asked [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=85.14s)]
*  about mixed status families, families that have undocumented people and people who are [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=90.54s)]
*  documented. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=95.42s)]
*  He said families can be deported, famously that answer. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=96.42s)]
*  But what about children who are undocumented? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=100.38000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's on so many minds, Reed. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=104.26s)]
*  And so I ended up speaking to a nonprofit out of San Antonio, Texas that began in 2017. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=106.38000000000001s)]
*  And so during the first Trump administration and since then they have trained over 30,000 [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=112.42s)]
*  teachers, students and families over what to do if I were to show up at schools. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=117.42s)]
*  They hold their whole premise is to create safe zones at schools. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=123.54s)]
*  Their policies essentially outline that part of what Trump is doing right now is essentially [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=127.58s)]
*  a part of doing this shock and awe campaign, right, that he wants to scare families in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=133.02s)]
*  letting them think that ICE agents can show up at schools and yank students out. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=138.54s)]
*  However, there are federal protections regarding student privacy that prevents anyone from [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=142.7s)]
*  going ahead and saying, hey, what is a student's status? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=148.02s)]
*  They can't ask that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=152.1s)]
*  And so right now, this nonprofit is essentially letting teachers know that there are federal [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=153.58s)]
*  protections in place for these students. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=159.7s)]
*  And of course, the question is, how long will those protections remain in place or at least [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=161.7s)]
*  untested? Andres. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=165.7s)]
*  Another executive order that Trump issued expands expedited deportation. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=167.14s)]
*  So talk to us about what that is. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=171.46s)]
*  And then I'm thinking in the environment of expedited deportation, do we even have the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=173.74s)]
*  infrastructure in these United States to do that? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=179.22s)]
*  Yeah, so let's break down what exactly expedited deportations mean. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=183.78s)]
*  So essentially, if someone was stopped near the border and had been here for less than two [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=187.18s)]
*  weeks, they could be sent back without seeing an immigration judge. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=191.06s)]
*  Now it can be done anywhere in the U.S. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=194.62s)]
*  And they have to and they also have to not prove that they've been living here over the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=197.82000000000002s)]
*  last two years. So the process is much faster than regular deportation. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=203.06s)]
*  And as far as the infrastructure goes, it seems that the president is determined to get [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=207.54000000000002s)]
*  it done one way or the other. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=212.10000000000002s)]
*  Just today, a U.S. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=213.42000000000002s)]
*  official told CBS News that there are a thousand additional soldiers that are preparing to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=214.78s)]
*  go to the border as we speak to beef up the presence there. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=219.06s)]
*  And so here in Los Angeles, it is a sanctuary city. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=222.9s)]
*  So the federal government cannot rely on any city resources to help them carry out [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=226.26000000000002s)]
*  immigration law. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=232.58s)]
*  Andres Gutierrez, thank you so much. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=234.14000000000001s)]
*  This is a story that will continue commanding headlines, I think, for days, weeks and months [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=236.38s)]
*  ahead. Thank you so much. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAh73UvKVM&t=240.1s)]
