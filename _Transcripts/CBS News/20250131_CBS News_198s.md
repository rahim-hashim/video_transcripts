# Details on next expected release of hostages from Hamas
**CBS News:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE)
*  A group representing the families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza has now confirmed the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=0.0s)]
*  names of three more captives set to be released this weekend. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=6.0s)]
*  The list includes a U.S. Israeli national, Keith Siegel. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=10.66s)]
*  CBS News reporter Hailey Ott is following the latest on this story from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=14.8s)]
*  Hailey, what more do we know about this next group of hostages set to be released this [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=19.6s)]
*  weekend? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=24.12s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=25.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=26.12s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=28.040000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=29.04s)]
*  So we've heard three names now from the families of the hostages. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=30.04s)]
*  They have been briefed by Israeli officials. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  Keith Siegel is on the list. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=34.4s)]
*  He is an American, originally from North Carolina. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=36.28s)]
*  He's 65 years old. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=38.84s)]
*  Also on the list is Yarden Bebus and Ofer Calderon. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=41.08s)]
*  You may recognize the name Bebus. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=45.0s)]
*  Yarden was taken hostage on October 7th, and so was his family, his wife and two small [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=47.28s)]
*  children. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=52.24s)]
*  There was video that was widely circulated of them being brought into Gaza on October [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=53.66s)]
*  7th. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=58.66s)]
*  They've become a real point of concern here in Israel because, obviously, of the age of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=59.66s)]
*  the children, but also because their status hasn't been known, whether or not they're [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=64.86s)]
*  alive or dead. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=69.34s)]
*  Unfortunately, the fact that Yarden is on the list tomorrow may mean that his family [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=70.34s)]
*  is no longer living. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=74.82s)]
*  According to the ceasefire deal, children, women and adults over the age of 50 were supposed [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=76.53999999999999s)]
*  to be released first and then other adults would be released. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=81.98s)]
*  The fact that Yarden, who isn't in any of those categories, is being released tomorrow [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=85.42s)]
*  may mean that there is no longer anyone alive to be released in those categories, and that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=89.89999999999999s)]
*  would include his family. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=95.02s)]
*  And we should mention, Haley, that this is all happening under phase one of the ceasefire [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=97.02s)]
*  deal between Israel and Hamas. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=101.18s)]
*  Where do things stand right now with negotiating a second phase? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=103.34s)]
*  This is a three-part ceasefire deal. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=109.46s)]
*  We are in phase one. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=111.89999999999999s)]
*  It's meant to last 42 days. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=113.1s)]
*  And on day 16 is when negotiations for the second phase are due to have begun by. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=114.58s)]
*  That is right around the corner. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=119.89999999999999s)]
*  There have been a few moments in the past few weeks where it looks like things could [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=121.41999999999999s)]
*  have gone off the rails. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=124.33999999999999s)]
*  They haven't. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=125.5s)]
*  And I was really curious about where we stood as this point of negotiation, again, between [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=126.5s)]
*  these parties was set to begin again. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=132.57999999999998s)]
*  So I spoke to a former Israeli hostage negotiator who has a lot of experience negotiating with [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=134.82s)]
*  Hamas, Gershon Baskin, and he actually said that it was the United States that was going [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=141.26s)]
*  to play a really big role in what comes next. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=145.7s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=148.74s)]
*  I think it's all on the shoulders of Trump. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=149.74s)]
*  If Trump is determined that this will take place, Netanyahu cannot go against him. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=154.94s)]
*  Netanyahu may try to create some kind of provocation, leading Hamas to breach the ceasefire, in [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=161.66s)]
*  which case Israel will say to the Americans, they breached it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=167.82s)]
*  Now we have to go back to war. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=170.7s)]
*  If Trump says yes, then that's the end. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=172.98s)]
*  If Trump says no, you can't go back to war. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=175.06s)]
*  So things are going according to plan. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=181.46s)]
*  Negotiations are set to take place again soon. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=184.7s)]
*  But according to this former hostage negotiator, what President Trump says and does in the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=186.54s)]
*  coming days is going to be really significant for how this plays out. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=192.7s)]
*  Chanel. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=195.94s)]
*  Haley. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=197.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9KyxXiVEFE&t=198.1s)]
