# More Jan. 6 defendants to be released amid Trump's pardons
**CBS News:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE)
*  Today, more of the January 6 riders are expected to be released from prison after President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump pardoned over 1,500 defendants. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=4.32s)]
*  The move has been met with its fair share of criticism from lawmakers on both, from [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=6.86s)]
*  both lawmakers and law enforcement. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=11.28s)]
*  U.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger told CBS News about the message that these pardons [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  are sending. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=18.52s)]
*  It sends the message that politics is more important than policing. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=19.52s)]
*  And my officers go out there every day and enforce the law impartially. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  It's such a slap in the face to those of us who literally experienced physical violence [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=29.28s)]
*  that day and to know that these violent criminals, these convicted felons are going to be released [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=33.24s)]
*  entirely scot-free with...it's, it just, it means, you know, there's no actual accountability. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=40.92s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News political reporter Torian Small for the very latest. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=48.96s)]
*  So what are you hearing from lawmakers about these pardons, Torian? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=55.52s)]
*  Yeah, Vlad, Democrats are pretty upset by that blanket pardon by the president. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  A lot of Democrats saying this flies in the face of this law and order presidency that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  Trump looks to bring to the office. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  What I am, though, interested in is how Republicans are responding to this. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=72.56s)]
*  So, Senator Loomis, for example, said that though she's uncomfortable by this, this is [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=76.56s)]
*  a precedent set by...she's putting the blame squarely on Joe Biden for sending this precedent [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=82.4s)]
*  of doing some unusual pardons. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=88.16s)]
*  Senator Kennedy was also an interesting response to this. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=91.88s)]
*  He said that he wouldn't certainly have made the decision that the president made. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=94.8s)]
*  He said he would have preferred that President Trump went case by case to evaluate whether [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=99.36s)]
*  or not these people should be receiving pardons. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  But he ultimately agreed with Loomis saying that this is a precedent set by Joe Biden. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=106.9s)]
*  He said that he would like to see...and this was pretty interesting how he worded this. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=111.62s)]
*  This was kind of like a warning to both administrations in the softest way possible. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=114.94s)]
*  He said he wants to see the government stop being weaponized and politicized, and he would [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=119.66s)]
*  love to see a return to normalcy that we saw before in his mind, Joe Biden. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=125.46s)]
*  There are reports, Torrey, of Senator Joni Ernst introducing legislation to prohibit [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=131.54s)]
*  federal funding for Planned Parenthood. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=136.14s)]
*  What are you hearing about that? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=137.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's according to a report from The Daily Caller. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=139.3s)]
*  They scooped this saying that Ernst is looking to introduce this sometime soon. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=141.94s)]
*  This isn't the first time she's introduced legislation like this. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=146.18s)]
*  The trigger here, according to their reporting, is that she was bothered by Planned Parenthood [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=149.78s)]
*  receiving COVID relief funds. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=155.54000000000002s)]
*  So in this report, it's outlined how they brought in about $2.6 million through PPP [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=157.94s)]
*  loans during the time of 2020 to 2021. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=165.74s)]
*  She's looking to not only rescind that, but forbid the government from giving them future [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=168.54s)]
*  funding. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=172.42s)]
*  But like we saw what happened in 2024, she unsuccessfully had that bill make it to the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=173.42s)]
*  Senate floor that was blocked by Democrats there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=180.1s)]
*  And we also know that though the Senate has a majority of Republicans, as well as the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=183.66s)]
*  majority in the House, it's unclear if she'll be able to bypass the filibuster, if she'll [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=189.38s)]
*  be able to get enough Democrats to support the bill. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=195.26s)]
*  How this measure could make it pass though is whether or not it will be a rider to this [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=198.7s)]
*  upcoming reconciliation bill that Republicans are looking to add. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=202.45999999999998s)]
*  So if she attaches it to that, there could be a pathway to blocking funding for Planned [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=205.89999999999998s)]
*  Parenthood moving forward. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=210.26s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=211.26s)]
*  We'll be watching. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=212.26s)]
*  Torian Small, thank you very much. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76pNTjSheOE&t=213.26s)]
