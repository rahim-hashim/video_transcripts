# Reagan National Airport reopens after D.C. plane crash
**CBS News:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU)
*  All right, now I want to bring in CBS News homeland security correspondent Nicole Skanga. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=0.0s)]
*  She is at Reagan National Airport, which just minutes ago reopened. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=4.3s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=9.6s)]
*  And actually we are just starting to see across from me. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=12.48s)]
*  There's a window if I can paint a picture for our viewers and we are just starting to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=15.52s)]
*  see the first commercial flights land. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=19.48s)]
*  We're here in terminal one. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=22.16s)]
*  We've been watching as a Southwest flight just landed moments ago and it's been fascinating [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=23.32s)]
*  to see the airport really transform over the past 14 hours. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=29.799999999999997s)]
*  I've been here for 14 hours initially at a standstill and we saw the monitors, the screens [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=34.12s)]
*  turn red as there were confused, frustrated, very upset, frankly, travelers here at the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=39.72s)]
*  airport. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=48.72s)]
*  Eventually those clearing out. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=49.72s)]
*  We know that at least 15 planes were grounded last night in addition to 19 that were diverted [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  to nearby Dulles Airport, but now can confirm that operations are fully up and running. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=57.28s)]
*  We've been speaking with some travelers who have trickled in asking, are you concerned? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=63.96s)]
*  Are you nervous? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=68.2s)]
*  We've gotten sort of mixed responses. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=69.2s)]
*  Some folks understandably shaken by some of the video that they saw surface overnight. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=71.54s)]
*  Others confident that they will travel safely today. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=77.88s)]
*  And of course, both myself and my colleagues have pressed the D.C. mayor, the secretary [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=82.08s)]
*  of transportation, lawmakers to say, you know, can the American public feel confident heading [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=87.32s)]
*  on a plane today? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=94.78s)]
*  And everyone has resoundingly responded. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=96.02s)]
*  Yes, the FAA feels confident. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=98.96s)]
*  There's been a lot of coordination in terms of law enforcement and first responders on [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=102.06s)]
*  the ground today. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=107.64s)]
*  As for Terminals one and Terminals two, just saw another Southwest flight take off. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=108.92s)]
*  It is business as usual, at least on this side of the airport. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=113.84s)]
*  And Nicole, you know, you spoke to D.C.'s mayor just about half an hour ago live here [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=118.0s)]
*  on CBS News 24 seven and she was talking about the kinds of support available to families [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=122.24s)]
*  of the victims. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=128.8s)]
*  Walk us through what is going to be offered. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=129.8s)]
*  Yeah, and really American Airlines is leading much of this. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=132.48s)]
*  So they've actually stood up a bit of a resource center in Terminal two that's across from [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=136.26s)]
*  where we are now, where it's serving as a place where families can gather. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=141.66s)]
*  They have resources available to them. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  There are counselors on standby and American, you know, offering many services to those [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=149.26s)]
*  families. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=154.38s)]
*  Of course, the mayor saying that, you know, the whole city is behind these individuals. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=155.38s)]
*  We heard lawmakers, both senators from Virginia as well as local congressmen say their offices [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=159.18s)]
*  are open for any families that need assistance or guidance during this time. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=167.34s)]
*  Earlier this morning, about two press conferences ago, we also saw both senators from Kansas. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=171.98000000000002s)]
*  They had rushed to Reagan National Airport to try to comfort some of the families that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=177.66s)]
*  were here and waiting. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=183.74s)]
*  Of course, our affiliate speaking to one individual who was waiting for his wife who said he had [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=185.18s)]
*  received a text message just 20 minutes before the flight was meant to land. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=190.46s)]
*  And so some very heartbreaking stories emerging. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=195.3s)]
*  We're still learning more about the victims. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=198.38s)]
*  But certainly there is an effort here to really try to lift up these families as much as possible. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=200.86s)]
*  It's interesting, I think in the next few days, and we've talked about this a little [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=207.98000000000002s)]
*  bit on 24 seven, there are going to be a number of questions that lawmakers pose, a [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=211.38s)]
*  number of questions for the NTSB, which is the lead investigative agency here about what [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=217.5s)]
*  went wrong. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=223.38s)]
*  But today the feeling is really trying to bolster and support these families as much [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=224.38s)]
*  as possible, focus on the victims, find out more about them and offer what guidance can [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=230.7s)]
*  be offered or what love can be offered, quite frankly, to their loved ones. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=238.26s)]
*  That being said, Washington, D.C., certainly a city and this certainly an airport DCA here, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=242.89999999999998s)]
*  many lawmakers in and out of this airport. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=249.22s)]
*  Certainly that was something senators spoke about today, many of them sitting on committees [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=252.17999999999998s)]
*  of commerce and transportation. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=256.58s)]
*  They're going to be some serious questions, some that we've raised during our segments [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=258.78s)]
*  the communication failures, the apparent lack of coordination here. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=264.34s)]
*  But today the feeling very much a focus here on the airport on lifting some of these families [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=269.21999999999997s)]
*  up. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=274.41999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that's an important point, Nicole, where this happened. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=275.41999999999996s)]
*  This is a historic tragedy, but also happened at an airport that is so central to the work [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=277.26s)]
*  of national lawmakers and, you know, frequented, as you said, by so many. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=283.29999999999995s)]
*  What does that say about national security? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=289.53999999999996s)]
*  We are hearing from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem today. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=291.58s)]
*  Yeah, we are hearing from the secretary and certainly the U.S. Coast Guard, which sits [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=295.18s)]
*  under the Department of Homeland Security, searched resources here in the early morning [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=300.58s)]
*  hours and late last night. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=305.94s)]
*  There were several vessels that came from nearby Station Washington and Station State [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=307.7s)]
*  Inigo. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=314.34s)]
*  And so lots of DHS personnel on the ground just walking around the airport. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=315.41999999999996s)]
*  It's very apparent that there is a real robust presence of TSA, a federal protective service [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=319.62s)]
*  of other law enforcement agencies that fall under the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=325.86s)]
*  So certainly we can feel that presence here on the ground. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=331.02000000000004s)]
*  But as you point out, and the mayor actually spoke with us about this, Washington, D.C. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=335.14000000000004s)]
*  has a very unique airspace. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=339.74s)]
*  There are federal assets here, clearly, as was the case last night with this Black Hawk [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=341.70000000000005s)]
*  Army helicopter. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=346.78000000000003s)]
*  And that does make it look a little different than some other cities, some other airspaces [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=348.3s)]
*  above other cities in the United States. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=352.70000000000005s)]
*  Certainly going to be a crucial part of this investigation. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=355.38000000000005s)]
*  She raised several questions about where the helicopter was supposed to be and what authorities, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=357.74s)]
*  you know, a DOD helicopter would need versus a private commercial helicopter, perhaps something [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=363.86s)]
*  that the NTSB will be looking into today. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=370.18s)]
*  I did think it was very interesting during our press conference earlier today. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=373.62s)]
*  The secretary of transportation was asked, similar to what President Trump had said earlier, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=379.82s)]
*  was this preventable? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=386.66s)]
*  And he responded, you know, without hesitation, he feels this was preventable. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=388.06s)]
*  So I know we're awaiting remarks by the president. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=392.70000000000005s)]
*  It'll be interesting to see if he sort of goes back to that point. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=396.78000000000003s)]
*  Certainly there are going to be a number of lessons learned in the coming days and [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=401.54s)]
*  weeks, but officials here, you know, despite being cautious about what they're letting [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=405.18s)]
*  us into in terms of the investigation, seem to think that this tragedy could have been [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=409.70000000000005s)]
*  prevented. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=414.74s)]
*  All right, Nicole Skanga for us live inside the airport. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7q1n4S_mU&t=415.74s)]
