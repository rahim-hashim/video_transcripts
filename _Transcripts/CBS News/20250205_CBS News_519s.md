# Ocasio-Cortez reacts to Trump's "horrific" Gaza plans, Johnson calls them "bold" move
**CBS News:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE)
*  On Capitol Hill, reaction is pouring in about President Trump's suggestion to quote, take [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=0.0s)]
*  over Gaza. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=6.32s)]
*  Here's the latest from Democrats who are slamming that proposal, calling it quote, horrific. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=7.32s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=12.56s)]
*  It is very clear that what the president talked about would make our country less safe. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=13.56s)]
*  An invasion of US troops into Gaza would not make Americans more safe. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=22.16s)]
*  It would make Americans a target. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=28.5s)]
*  But this is very clear. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=32.5s)]
*  I mean, I'm going to just take a wild guess that the president's plans include hotels [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=33.7s)]
*  and resorts and casinos. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=39.18s)]
*  That's just who he is. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=41.78s)]
*  It is horrific. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=42.78s)]
*  It is the definition of ethnic cleansing. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=43.78s)]
*  It is part of the culmination of what I view to be genocide of the Palestinian people. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=44.78s)]
*  And this is genuinely one of the most horrific. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=45.78s)]
*  Humanitarian catastrophes that we've seen in modern history. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=46.78s)]
*  And following it all for us on Capitol Hill is CBS News congressional correspondent Nicole [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=63.18s)]
*  Killian. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=67.7s)]
*  Nicole, thank you for joining us today. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=68.7s)]
*  We know GOP, GOP lawmakers have a different response to all of this. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=70.34s)]
*  What is it and what have you been hearing? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=75.42s)]
*  Well, it does vary. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=77.06s)]
*  I want to be clear about that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=80.06s)]
*  Obviously, House and Senate Republicans aren't a monolith, but we did get a chance to get [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=81.94s)]
*  a sense of Republican reaction by speaking with House Speaker Mike Johnson, who held [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=86.74000000000001s)]
*  a news conference earlier today. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=92.66s)]
*  And I asked him yes or no, if he supports the president's statement that the US should [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=94.54s)]
*  seize control of Gaza. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=99.9s)]
*  Take a listen to his response. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=101.58s)]
*  And I think that's a bold, decisive move. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=105.42s)]
*  And I think you have to do something to eradicate the threat to Israel. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=111.1s)]
*  Here's the problem. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=115.3s)]
*  If you leave Gaza in its current form, there's always a risk of another October 7. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=116.3s)]
*  There's always a risk of proxies of Iran, all these terrorist organizations, whose openly [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=122.7s)]
*  stated goal is to eliminate Israel as a state. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=127.46000000000001s)]
*  So it just makes sense to make the neighborhood there safer. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=130.54s)]
*  I think that's logical. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=135.02s)]
*  I think it follows common sense. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=136.02s)]
*  I think people understand the necessity of it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=137.02s)]
*  And we're going to stand with Israel as they work towards this goal. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=139.3s)]
*  And we'll stand with the president on his initiative. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=142.34s)]
*  So even though he said that this is something that would be very bold at the same time, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=144.7s)]
*  he didn't definitively say yes or no, whether he supports the president's statement. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=151.26s)]
*  He did, however, say that it's important to have more details and that he intends to discuss [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=155.9s)]
*  those details at some point. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=162.1s)]
*  It's also worth noting that we expect Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to be here on [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=164.5s)]
*  Capitol Hill tomorrow. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=169.02s)]
*  So there is an opportunity potentially there. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=170.86s)]
*  But certainly that is kind of the response we have heard from other congressional Republicans [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=174.54s)]
*  in terms of trying to take a step back and saying, look, you know, let's get more details [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=179.34s)]
*  about this. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=184.66s)]
*  But at the same time, trying to be supportive of the president's stance in the sense of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=185.66s)]
*  wanting to have more stability in the region. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=191.01999999999998s)]
*  OK, Nicole, let's switch gears now to a different issue, because we're just six weeks away from [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=194.85999999999999s)]
*  federal government funding lapsing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=200.57999999999998s)]
*  The Democrats say it's on Republicans to not have a government shutdown. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=202.45999999999998s)]
*  So what are lawmakers doing right now to try to avert that? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=206.89999999999998s)]
*  Well, there have been a number of bipartisan discussions happening behind the scenes since [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=212.98s)]
*  the start of the new Congress, understanding that this deadline is fast approaching in [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=218.18s)]
*  mid-March. But at the same time, you know, all of these flurry of actions that we have [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=222.5s)]
*  seen on the part of the Trump administration is really ruffling the feathers of congressional [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=227.3s)]
*  Democrats. So they are finding it more challenging to kind of move forward with some of these [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=233.1s)]
*  negotiations, because for them, their bottom line is this. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=238.82s)]
*  You know, look, you can't try to freeze federal funding. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=242.10000000000002s)]
*  You can't try to shut down these agencies without any kind of congressional approval [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=245.1s)]
*  or notice. And so if we're going to fund the government, we need to adhere to those [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=250.1s)]
*  principles of making sure that congressionally appropriated funds are appropriated. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=256.02s)]
*  So that is kind of the posture and position that Democrats are taking at this time. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=261.94s)]
*  You know, whether or not that leads to an impasse in terms of these negotiations and a [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=267.38s)]
*  resolution in terms of government funding remains to be seen. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=272.86s)]
*  You know, time and again, congressional leaders always say that they don't want a federal [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=276.58000000000004s)]
*  government shutdown. But on the same token, you know, it is a challenging landscape and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=281.02000000000004s)]
*  environment for both sides to continue these negotiations in earnest in some [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=286.54s)]
*  lawmakers view. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=293.98s)]
*  And Nicole, let's move on now to confirmation watch. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=295.58000000000004s)]
*  Let's listen to what Senator Chuck Schumer had to say about Russell vote vote, by the way, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=298.26s)]
*  is Trump's nominee to lead the Office of Management and Budget. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=302.74s)]
*  Let's listen here. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=306.38s)]
*  All 47 Democrats will vote against Russell vote. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=308.14s)]
*  We united in our agreement that Russell vote is a dangerous and destructive choice to lead [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=313.18s)]
*  the Office of Management and Budget. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=319.14s)]
*  And we saw a precursor to his leadership last week during the dangerous federal funding [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=321.7s)]
*  freeze that crippled or nearly crippled critical duties of the federal government and its [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=325.94s)]
*  operation as the chief architect, chief cook and bottle washer of Project 2025. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=330.7s)]
*  It's Russell vote who is laser focused on undermining our government. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=337.34s)]
*  He's proven it. Senate Democrats will unanimously oppose him and do everything we can to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=342.7s)]
*  prevent him from leading OMB. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=349.14s)]
*  So, Nicole, the question here is what does this mean for Russell votes path to confirmation? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=353.02s)]
*  Well, we'll have to see. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=360.21999999999997s)]
*  But Senate Democrats, as you heard there from Chuck Schumer, have made clear that they intend [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=361.97999999999996s)]
*  to oppose his nomination. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=366.97999999999996s)]
*  And so what we have learned from leadership aides is that they do intend to hold the floor [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=368.94s)]
*  when his nomination comes up for a vote. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=374.02s)]
*  So usually the way things work is there's a procedural vote that is taken to move forward [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=376.26s)]
*  with the nomination to, you know, have debate and then end debate. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=381.02s)]
*  And so that sometimes can be a period of up to 30 hours. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=384.86s)]
*  So what Senate Democrats are saying is that they are going to hold the floor during that time, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=387.98s)]
*  which means we will likely see a number of Senate Democrats come to the floor in opposition [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=393.54s)]
*  of his nomination, at least to try to slow walk the process, whether or not they can [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=397.38s)]
*  stop him from being confirmed. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=401.34s)]
*  Obviously, they don't necessarily have the numbers to do that. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=403.06s)]
*  But if they can slow it down, at least for now, that is their main objective. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=406.34s)]
*  And meanwhile, Nicole, Trump's nominee for attorney general Pam Bondi, she sailed through [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=411.3s)]
*  confirmation yesterday. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=415.82s)]
*  Trump gave her these high remarks moments ago. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=417.38s)]
*  Listen. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=419.65999999999997s)]
*  She's going to restore fair, equal and impartial justice and restore the constitutional rule [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=421.06s)]
*  of law in America. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=426.46s)]
*  She will lead the Democrats. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=428.82s)]
*  You know where they're going to, she's going to lead them right down. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=431.21999999999997s)]
*  But I think she's going to be as impartial as you can possibly be. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=433.94s)]
*  I know I'm supposed to say she's going to be totally impartial with respect to Democrats. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=437.02s)]
*  And I think she will be as impartial as a person can be. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=442.21999999999997s)]
*  So Pam Bondi sailing through, who will we see be confirmed next, Nicole? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=446.26s)]
*  Well, again, as you mentioned, we're obviously watching the nomination of Russell Vought. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=452.94s)]
*  As we've been reporting throughout the week, we now know that some of the president's more [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=457.18s)]
*  controversial nominees have been reported out of committee, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=462.06s)]
*  as well as Tulsi Gabbard for HHS secretary, as well as the director of national intelligence. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=467.58000000000004s)]
*  Obviously, we're still waiting for a firm date for those confirmation votes by the full [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=476.14000000000004s)]
*  Senate, but they are certainly now in the pipeline. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=481.86s)]
*  Now that they have advanced out of committee, we have also seen other officials advance, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=485.42s)]
*  whether that is the Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=491.58000000000004s)]
*  His nomination was one of the ones that was up today, as well as others. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=495.65999999999997s)]
*  But certainly we are seeing the Senate, particularly Senate Republicans, try to move [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=500.38s)]
*  as swiftly as they can on these nominations. Another one worth noting, of course, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=505.34s)]
*  Cash Patel. We expect the Senate judiciary to vote on his confirmation tomorrow. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=509.41999999999996s)]
*  All right, Nicole Killian. Thank you so much for joining us today. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdo2UJ0evvE&t=515.26s)]
