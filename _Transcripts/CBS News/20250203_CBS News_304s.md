# At least 12 bodies still missing from D.C. plane crash, officials say
**CBS News:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ)
*  Also happening today, salvage operations started this morning in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Spatomic River declare the wreckage of last week's collision between a plane and army [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=4.48s)]
*  helicopter. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=9.68s)]
*  You can see authorities there picking up what looks to be part of the American Airlines [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=10.92s)]
*  plane, that engine of that plane. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  All 67 people on board both aircraft, including the Blackhawk helicopter, have died. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=18.96s)]
*  So far, authorities recover the remains of 55 of those victims. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=24.72s)]
*  We bring in now CBS News correspondent Skyler Henry. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=28.6s)]
*  He's at Reagan International Airport. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=31.16s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us, Skyler. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=33.24s)]
*  What are salvage operations looking like today? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=35.04s)]
*  How long is this going to take? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  Well, as they are hours into this process, they've given a tentative timeline of somewhere [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=39.800000000000004s)]
*  around nine to 10 days from start to finish as to when they plan on completing their work. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=47.2s)]
*  But that can all change, giving a variety of factors, everything from the weather to [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=52.34s)]
*  conditions of the actual Potomac River. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=57.0s)]
*  But they say that they are focused for the first several days on removing the debris [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  and the fuselage of the CRJ, the commercial regional jet that American Airlines aircraft [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=64.25999999999999s)]
*  outside of the water. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=70.88s)]
*  They also mentioned that they are still very much in the recovery phase of this operation [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=72.0s)]
*  as well. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=77.12s)]
*  Still looking for 12 of those who perished during last week's collision. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=78.12s)]
*  So if they were to find said remains in this process, then that would put a pause in their [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=82.75999999999999s)]
*  work so that dive teams and others can do what they need to do to properly identify [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=87.88s)]
*  those victims that have still yet to have been ID'd. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=92.84s)]
*  From there, they will then move over to the military Blackhawk helicopter, which should [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=98.08s)]
*  take several days as well. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=103.64s)]
*  Both aircraft will be put onto barges and then taken to a nearby hangar so that the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=105.36s)]
*  NTSB can continue to move forward with their work. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=110.8s)]
*  We heard from D.C.'s Unified Command, including the Fire Department, the Coast Guard, as well [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=112.6s)]
*  as other agencies talking about the steps that they are taking part in in order to make [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  sure that this process moves according to plan. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=122.72s)]
*  They say that there are experienced divers as part of this. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=125.12s)]
*  There are salvage experts that are coming from all across the country to help out in [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=129.0s)]
*  this process. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=133.28s)]
*  But they say that they are aware that this could very well take some time before it's [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=134.51999999999998s)]
*  all complete. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=138.06s)]
*  You feel for the family members. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=139.9s)]
*  You saw a lot of them gather on the shoreline of the Potomac on Sunday for a memorial ceremony, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=141.34s)]
*  Skyler. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=147.06s)]
*  What do you know so far about the identification on those 55 people that were recovered? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=148.06s)]
*  And what does recovery look like as authorities remove that debris? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=153.98s)]
*  I mean, it's a very delicate operation, I understand. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=158.9s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=162.74s)]
*  Do you remember the Key Bridge collapse up in Baltimore about a year ago? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=165.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=170.98000000000002s)]
*  Does that ring a bell to you? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=171.98000000000002s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=172.98000000000002s)]
*  The divers who were involved in that process are actually the same dive team that's involved [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=174.58s)]
*  in this one. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=179.42000000000002s)]
*  Experienced divers. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=180.56s)]
*  But they say that this is a meticulous process because, yes, they are continuing to work [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  through a debris field, right, where there are plane engine parts as well as helicopter [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=185.18s)]
*  parts as well. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=191.74s)]
*  They also say that they are working to try to find different parts of the plane, the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=193.38s)]
*  fuselage, the tail, to see whether there are remains that are in those parts of the damaged [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=198.46s)]
*  aircraft as well. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=206.78s)]
*  From there, there's then coordination with emergency crews here in Washington to try [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=208.01999999999998s)]
*  to properly identify the 12 who have yet to be ID'd. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=214.5s)]
*  They also say that they are still working, they being the NTSB as well as other officials, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=222.06s)]
*  to consult family members who have come out and made the trip to Reagan. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=227.12s)]
*  Remember, some of these people lived in Kansas, others elsewhere around the country and even [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=230.82s)]
*  from an international perspective, all of which coming to this area to try to get to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=235.94s)]
*  the bottom of why this happened. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=240.02s)]
*  We heard from NTSB officials over the weekend who said that some of them are angry, some [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  of them frustrated, some of them really trying to figure out exactly what went wrong. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=246.68s)]
*  That is why officials say that they are working around the clock to get to the bottom of that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=251.7s)]
*  as well. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=255.26s)]
*  We know that the NTSB is working on their aspects of the investigation, still very much [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=256.26s)]
*  in the early parts of that process, but say that they are conducting interviews with at [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=260.74s)]
*  least five of the air traffic control operators who were in the tower at the time of the collision, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=265.0s)]
*  the local controller, the ground controller, the assistant to the local, as well as the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=270.58s)]
*  operations supervisor and the operations supervisor in training. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=274.7s)]
*  They are taking all a step as part of the process as they look to put the pieces together [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=278.94s)]
*  to make sure that what happened last week never happens again and then come out with [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=282.90000000000003s)]
*  recommendations not only for the FAA but for military as well as they are trying to figure [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=287.26000000000005s)]
*  out whether training operations should continue in and around this airspace as well. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=293.42s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Skylar Henry is at Reagan National Airport for us. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=298.74s)]
*  Thank you so much Skylar. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BsqClHTFQ&t=302.62s)]
