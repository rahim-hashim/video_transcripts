# Layoffs spiked in February, led by DOGE cuts
**CBS News:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g)
*  Welcome back to America Decides. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=0.0s)]
*  Layoffs in February were fueled by Department of Government Efficiencies cuts. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=4.0s)]
*  Employers cut over 172,000 jobs last month, according to the firm Challenger Gray & Christmas. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=9.0s)]
*  And that's the highest number of layoffs per month since the height of the pandemic in July of 2020. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=16.0s)]
*  CBS News Money Watch correspondent Kelly O'Grady joins us now to make sense of this all. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=22.0s)]
*  Kelly, good to see you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=27.0s)]
*  So how bad exactly are these numbers? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=29.0s)]
*  They're pretty bad, Caitlin. Just to give you some context, this was a 245% jump versus the layoffs numbers that we saw in January. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=32.0s)]
*  Now, February there is always a bit higher traditionally than what you see in January, but it was a 100% jump versus what we saw in February layoffs in 2024. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=41.0s)]
*  So this is a big number. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=51.0s)]
*  And then I was going back through the report's history. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=53.0s)]
*  They've been looking at this space for about 30 years. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=55.0s)]
*  There were 11 times before where there were numbers that were higher than what we saw last month. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=58.0s)]
*  All 11 of those were when the U.S. was in a recession. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=63.0s)]
*  So that kind of gives you some context that these numbers were actually pretty bad. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=67.0s)]
*  That's why there's so much concern and talk about it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=70.0s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=72.0s)]
*  And I think a lot of people are wondering how much exactly these Doge cuts are contributing to this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=73.0s)]
*  About a third. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=80.0s)]
*  So of that 172,000 number, it was roughly 62,000 and change that were coming from the Doge layoffs. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=81.0s)]
*  Now, of course, expect next month when we get this data again, that to also be a big component because those layoffs were ongoing. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=88.0s)]
*  But there were a couple of other sectors that also spiked retail technology, consumer products. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=95.0s)]
*  And the reasons that they gave were economic conditions, fear of inflation. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=101.0s)]
*  Also, we had a lot of bankruptcies in the retail space. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=106.0s)]
*  So it wasn't just Doge, but that was a big contributor. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=109.0s)]
*  And, you know, we've all been watching the stock market in terms of Trump's tariff plan. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=112.0s)]
*  But I'm wondering if this has any impact on the stock market. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=117.0s)]
*  Could we see it there? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=120.0s)]
*  Yeah, if you were watching the stock market, I mean, you were on a roller coaster today in the past couple of days. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=122.0s)]
*  So you're right that most of this was tariffs and just the uncertainty in general. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=127.0s)]
*  But this morning, these numbers came out and there was a big drop because there is a lot of uncertainty about where the labor market is. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=131.0s)]
*  We've also seen consumer spending pull back. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=140.0s)]
*  There are fears of inflation. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=142.0s)]
*  And as we think about the Federal Reserve and there's an interest rate decision in the next couple of weeks, if you have rising inflation and a slowing job market or a lot of layoffs, that's going to be a really tough decision for them to make. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=144.0s)]
*  All right. We will continue to keep an eye on that volatile market. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=157.0s)]
*  Kelly O'Grady, thank you as always for breaking this down for us. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=160.0s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qIpGNbE3g&t=163.0s)]
