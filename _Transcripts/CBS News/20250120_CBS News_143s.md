# Trump's plans for Jan. 6 defendants
**CBS News:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY)
*  The inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump will commence in just a few hours from now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=0.0s)]
*  This is a live look at the Capitol. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=5.44s)]
*  He'll take the oath of office for a second time inside that structure. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=7.92s)]
*  By noon today, he'll officially be the 47th president of the United States. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  This morning, Trump will attend a prayer service at St. John's Episcopal Church there in Lafayette Square, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=17.48s)]
*  followed by Tea with the Bidens at the White House. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=22.84s)]
*  They'll be sworn in and deliver his inaugural address. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=25.88s)]
*  Now, instead of the traditional presidential parade down Pennsylvania Avenue, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=29.24s)]
*  Trump will hold a celebration at Capitol One Arena before heading back to the White House. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=33.2s)]
*  For more on all of this, let's bring in CBS News political reporter Torian Small. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=39.28s)]
*  Torian, I'm wondering about Trump's executive orders and actions, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=43.72s)]
*  some hundreds of them that will be signed today, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=49.28s)]
*  specifically what he plans for those convicted of January 6 offenses. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=51.68s)]
*  What do we know? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=56.0s)]
*  Yeah, around the eve of his inauguration, Trump held a rally at the Capitol One Arena here in D.C. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=57.36s)]
*  He told supporters that they would be pretty happy with his decision on what he's calling the January 6 hostages. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=63.0s)]
*  Now, Trump has long had this standing sympathy for his supporters who were either accused of or charged and found guilty of crimes involving the riot that happened on January 6, 2021. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=70.04s)]
*  He said on the campaign trail, this reimagining of what happened that day, saying that it was largely peaceful. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=83.8s)]
*  And he's been committed, at least what he's been telling his supporters and rallygoers at the event yesterday, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=89.92s)]
*  that he plans to pardon those particularly involved in that event. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  Now, what that would look like is still to be determined. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=103.24s)]
*  His vice president, incoming vice president, J.D. Vance, said on Fox News last week that that shouldn't [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=106.2s)]
*  include those charged with violent crimes. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=113.36s)]
*  He says, quote, to keep it simple, those who peacefully protested should be pardoned. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=118.52s)]
*  Those who were convicted of violence on that day obviously should not be pardoned. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  But as we've seen in the past, he doesn't speak for the president, though he's just trying to speak to the mindset he believes Donald Trump has going into his decision. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=128.64s)]
*  Yeah, we will look closely at what Trump's executive orders actually entail. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=136.52s)]
*  Torian Small, thank you very much for that. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivI_GDUtBZY&t=141.04s)]
