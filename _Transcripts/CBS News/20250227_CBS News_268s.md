# Trump meeting with UK's Starmer at the White House
**CBS News:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI)
*  President Trump is set to meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=0.0s)]
*  Rami Anosensio joins us from London with more on that meeting. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=3.44s)]
*  Rami, what will be high on the British Prime Minister's agenda for today's meeting? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=8.08s)]
*  What does he want to get done? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=12.96s)]
*  Errol, good morning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=14.52s)]
*  Yeah, first off, on a very basic level, I think to try to make sure that this US-UK [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=16.04s)]
*  special relationship doesn't go up in flames while also trying to what I'm saying is playing [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=21.96s)]
*  a very friendly defense of the British economy, which we know isn't doing well already, on [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=28.34s)]
*  national security vis-a-vis Ukraine and Russia, and definitely for his own political stability [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=34.66s)]
*  after attacks from Elon Musk. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=41.06s)]
*  Go ahead and take a listen to this. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=43.019999999999996s)]
*  You know, taking out a chainsaw isn't quite my style, but we are stripping away red tape [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=45.379999999999995s)]
*  and bureaucracy. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=54.06s)]
*  We are reforming, permitting, getting things built, reducing barriers to investment and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=55.54s)]
*  growth, and we're open for business, open for investment, and we're determined to help [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=60.98s)]
*  US innovators thrive in the United Kingdom. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=67.86s)]
*  And Sir Keir also said that we share the view that our best days lie ahead so that British [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=72.06s)]
*  stiff upper lip Errol and Starmer try to be positive, even though he and Trump we know [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=78.7s)]
*  are politically opposite of each other. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=83.32s)]
*  Sir Keir does go to the White House, though, with a carrot, or if you will, a tribute in [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  his hand for Trump. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=90.8s)]
*  It's that bump in UK defense spending that he just announced two days ago. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=92.44s)]
*  The timing is notable here, obviously, but will this bump be enough to appease Donald [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=97.16s)]
*  Trump? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=102.0s)]
*  The UK's current spending is 2.3% of GDP. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=103.0s)]
*  The new gold is just a little bit higher, 2.5% of GDP by 2027, but that means another [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=106.52s)]
*  $17 billion going into defense. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=111.16s)]
*  Then there's a potential 3% after the next general election, but that would need to happen [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=113.76s)]
*  no later than August 2029. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=119.16s)]
*  So that's still, what, five years from now, potentially. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=120.8s)]
*  Trump has basically threatened NATO that if member countries don't raise all their defense [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=124.6s)]
*  budgets, Pete Hegseth said 5%. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=128.72s)]
*  Washington could have second thoughts about that role in mutual defense known as Article [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=132.2s)]
*  If an enemy, let's say Russia, attacks one, then it's an attack against all. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=137.4s)]
*  Personal relationships are really important to President Trump, and as you've mentioned, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=143.72s)]
*  both he and Keir Starmer are political opposites. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=148.56s)]
*  I don't know that they've even met. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=150.72s)]
*  And when you contrast that with French President Emmanuel Macron, they've known each other [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=152.28s)]
*  for a long time. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=157.16000000000003s)]
*  Macron seemed to be able to be friendly, but be firm. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  I wonder if the UK is still at risk from tariffs considering that this relationship with Keir [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  Starmer is new. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=167.68s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=168.68s)]
*  The short answer is yes. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=169.68s)]
*  And with those tariffs, just about two weeks away, the tariffs, by the way, 25% on steel [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=171.84s)]
*  and aluminum that are set to kick in, not just for the UK, but for anyone who is exporting [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=179.44s)]
*  steel and aluminum into the United States. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=186.2s)]
*  The date there, March 12th, specifically for here in the UK, something like 40,000 jobs [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=189.12s)]
*  are directly linked to those industries. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=195.88000000000002s)]
*  If they happen, prices could rise, plants could close, jobs could be lost. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  And then there is the EU waiting as well. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=205.08s)]
*  Trump just said, confirming again that he'll throw 25% tariffs on EU products. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=209.16000000000003s)]
*  He specifically mentioned cars. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=215.24s)]
*  And, you know, we're talking about former allies, still allies, I suppose. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=217.84s)]
*  But when he says things like this, it makes you think twice. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=223.04s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=225.67999999999998s)]
*  The European Union was formed in order to screw the United States. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=226.67999999999998s)]
*  That's the purpose of it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  And they've done a good job of it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  But now I'm president. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=233.64s)]
*  Screw the United States, right? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=236.16s)]
*  Starmer meets with Trump after that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=237.92s)]
*  He's set to meet with European leaders this Sunday, Errol. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=240.0s)]
*  No doubt he'll be briefing them about his talks in the Oval Office. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=243.64s)]
*  In the White House there. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=247.72s)]
*  We understand that leaders from Germany, Italy and Poland are confirmed. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=249.04s)]
*  There's talk that Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine might attend. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=252.56s)]
*  That depends on how things go with his meeting with Trump. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=255.36s)]
*  That's set tomorrow, as Weeders has told us, when he is expected to sign some kind of deal [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=258.2s)]
*  over minerals there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=262.68s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=263.68s)]
*  We know we'll all be watching. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=264.68s)]
*  Remy, thanks so much. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=265.68s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaofmEASbpI&t=266.68s)]
