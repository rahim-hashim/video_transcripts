# Trump takes questions on Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Oval Office
**CBS News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE)
*  President Trump is swearing in Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=0.0s)]
*  signing some executive orders in the Oval Office. It's happening moments ago. Let's listen. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=8.64s)]
*  I've never seen anything. I have pictures that are – you wouldn't believe it. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=13.0s)]
*  You wouldn't believe what you have to look at. Young, beautiful soldiers that are just [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=17.68s)]
*  being decimated. And it would be nice to end it immediately. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=22.2s)]
*  But we had a very good talk with – people didn't really know what President Putin's [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=27.6s)]
*  thoughts were, but I think I can say with great confidence he wants to see it ended [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=34.44s)]
*  also. That's good. And we're going to work toward getting it ended and as fast as possible. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=38.72s)]
*  It's a horrible situation going on. It's flat land, and the bullet goes off, and the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=45.36s)]
*  only thing it can hit is a body, a human body, a young human body. And they're losing just [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=51.68s)]
*  tremendous numbers of mostly soldiers. The cities and towns have been largely demolished. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=58.08s)]
*  It's a shame what's happened to that country. It would have never happened if I were president. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=65.72s)]
*  That I can tell you. It would have never happened to look at that. And October 7th would have [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=69.6s)]
*  never happened either, by the way, the Middle East. But we'll get it – I think we'll [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=75.24s)]
*  get it – we'll get something done. We're going to be meeting – actually, tomorrow [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=81.16s)]
*  they're meeting in Munich, as you know, and we're going to have some other meetings. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  And we'll be – I'll be dealing with President Putin largely on the phone. And we ultimately [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=89.16s)]
*  expect to meet. In fact, we expect that he'll come here and I'll go there. And we're going [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=94.84s)]
*  to meet also probably in Saudi Arabia the first time. We'll meet in Saudi Arabia, see [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=100.16s)]
*  if we can get something done. But we want to end that war. That war is a disaster. It's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=104.64s)]
*  a really bloody horrible war. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=109.68s)]
*  But you said Saudi Arabia, the first meeting now. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=112.0s)]
*  I think so. We think we're going to probably meet in Saudi Arabia the first meeting. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=115.92s)]
*  Right. Any idea when? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=119.32s)]
*  Hasn't been set, but not too distant future. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=120.32s)]
*  Did you also part of that meeting? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=122.44s)]
*  We both understand, you know, we know the ground prints. And I think it'd be a very [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=124.16s)]
*  good place to meet. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=130.48s)]
*  So it sounds like that would just be a meeting between you and Putin and perhaps the ground [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=131.48s)]
*  prints, but not President Zelensky and – [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  Probably we'll have a first meeting and then we'll see what we can do about the second meeting. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=137.92s)]
*  Did you also commit to go to Ukraine? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=142.92s)]
*  What about Ukraine? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=146.56s)]
*  Did you commit to go to Ukraine as well? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=147.56s)]
*  No, I haven't. I haven't committed to go to Ukraine. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=149.28s)]
*  Would you go? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=152.16s)]
*  I would think about going. Yeah, I'd think about it. No problem. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=154.67999999999998s)]
*  Can you say to the lady, Mr. President, that they received your vision? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=157.6s)]
*  What is your plan to end this war? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=161.28s)]
*  Like today's Secretary of Defense – [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=163.2s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to tell you my plan. I can just tell you we've made a lot of progress. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=164.68s)]
*  This should have been done by Biden, not by me, because this has been going on for now [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=167.76s)]
*  a long time, years. And it should have been done by Biden. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=172.48s)]
*  Just like the young gentleman that I brought home yesterday after two weeks. We worked [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=177.76s)]
*  He was a fine man and he was in there for three and a half, almost four years. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=183.92s)]
*  And they weren't able to do a thing and I got him out. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=191.28s)]
*  And as you know, I didn't pay $6 billion. I didn't pay anything. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  We did a trade and we did a good job. We got him out in two weeks. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=199.44s)]
*  Should have been out years ago. Really should have been out years ago. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  What was the post-NATO membership for Ukraine? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=210.08s)]
*  I don't think it's practical to have it personally. I know that a new Secretary of Defense, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=212.96s)]
*  who's excellent, Pete, made a statement today saying that he thinks it's unlikely or impractical. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=219.52s)]
*  I think probably that's true. I think long before President Putin, they said there's no way they'd [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=225.52s)]
*  allow that. This has been going on for many, many years. They've been saying that for a long time, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=230.96s)]
*  that Ukraine cannot go into NATO. And I'm okay with that. I just want the war, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=237.04s)]
*  whether they are or they're not. But it certainly would seem to be that most people have said that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=243.28s)]
*  that is something that's not going to happen. Are you freezing out President Zelensky of this [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=248.16s)]
*  process a bit? Isn't there a danger of that? No, I don't think so, as long as he's there. But, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=253.04s)]
*  you know, at some point you're going to have to have elections too. You're going to have to have [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=257.6s)]
*  an election. But he says he wants to secure his assurances, Mr. President. What does that look like? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=260.56s)]
*  In terms of what? If the war were to end, he says he wants guarantees of security. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=265.44000000000005s)]
*  We'll see what that means. We have, I think when the war ends, one thing he was very [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=271.6s)]
*  strong about, he wants, if it ends, he wants it to end. And that's President Putin said that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=276.32000000000005s)]
*  He wants it to end. He doesn't want to end it and then go back to fighting six months later. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  We talked about the possibility, I mentioned it, of a ceasefire so we can stop the killing. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=286.8s)]
*  And I think we'll probably end up at some point getting a ceasefire in the not too distant future. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=291.04s)]
*  Say it. What? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  It's an interesting question. I think they have to make peace. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  Their people are being killed and I think they have to make peace. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=310.64000000000004s)]
*  I said that was not a good war to go into and I think they have to make peace. That's what I think. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=315.12s)]
*  I think they have to make peace. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=321.04s)]
*  Well, he's going to have to do what he has to do, but, you know, his poll numbers aren't [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=328.96000000000004s)]
*  particularly great, to put it mildly. He's got a country where, you know, it's been savaged and [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=334.48s)]
*  attacked and he's got an army that's been very, very brave actually, despite the fact that, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=341.76s)]
*  you know, we've given him, in my opinion, $350 billion. That's what the real number is. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=348.56s)]
*  You don't hear that number. And Europe has given him, my opinion, $100 billion. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=353.92s)]
*  And they've done it in the form of a loan. And I have a Secretary of Treasury right now who's [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=358.96s)]
*  actually quite brave. He's over in Ukraine on a train and there's a lot of things happening around [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=363.76s)]
*  that train that aren't so good. And he's going there to get a document done where we're going to [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=369.76s)]
*  be assured that we're going to, in some form, get this money back because we're putting up [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=376.72s)]
*  far more money than Europe and Europe is in far more danger than we are. We have an ocean in between. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=382.96000000000004s)]
*  Europe has nothing in between. You know what they have in between? They have Ukraine in between. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=388.72s)]
*  So, wait a minute. So, as you know, Europe is putting up money and they're getting it in the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=393.92s)]
*  form of a loan. And the United States, under Biden, didn't do loans. They just handed money [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  every time somebody walked in from Ukraine. They just handed them money foolishly. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=404.88s)]
*  This should have never happened. It should have never started. And once it did, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=410.0s)]
*  other things should have happened. Other things should have taken place. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=413.92s)]
*  So, we're getting security on our money. We're going to have it secured by — they have [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=417.36s)]
*  raw earth and they have oil and gas and they have a lot of other things. And [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=424.08s)]
*  we're asking for security on our money. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=428.0s)]
*  So, does it mean you are not sending any more aid to Ukraine? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=430.0s)]
*  Ukraine has agreed to it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=433.59999999999997s)]
*  Does it mean you are not sending any more aid to Ukraine? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=434.96s)]
*  No, we are, but we want it secured. And the money is going to be secured. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=438.0s)]
*  When will the U.S. stop sending funding? When will the U.S. stop sending funding? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=441.59999999999997s)]
*  Because if we didn't do that, then Putin would say he won. We're the thing that's holding it back. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=445.84s)]
*  And frankly, we'll go as long as we have to go because we're not going to let the other happen. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=451.67999999999995s)]
*  But President Putin wants to have peace now, and that's good. And he didn't want to have peace with Biden. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=456.8s)]
*  And you tell me why. That is, okay. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=464.8s)]
*  Was that conversation with Putin to start these negotiations part of the deal to bring Fogel home? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=466.88000000000005s)]
*  No, but it was a nice thing that he allowed Mark Fogel to leave. In fact, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=472.48s)]
*  Mark is wasn't feeling well, but he was all of a sudden about two weeks ago, he started [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=479.44s)]
*  being treated very nicely. He said they took him out for haircuts. They took him out. They [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=487.6s)]
*  helped him out a little bit and made him feel better, made him look better. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=493.84000000000003s)]
*  And they were nice to him. And he said, I saw something happening. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=498.32s)]
*  And it had to it coincided with when I came into office. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=503.76s)]
*  So that was nice. And he was he's a fine person. He was so happy to be out. He was there. He was [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=507.6s)]
*  there for three and a half years plus. And he shouldn't have been there at all. He should have [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=514.5600000000001s)]
*  they should have had him out much faster than that. Go ahead, please. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, I think Pete said today that that's unlikely, right? It certainly would seem to [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=531.52s)]
*  be unlikely. They took a lot of land and they fought for that land and they lost a lot of [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=536.32s)]
*  soldiers. But it would just seem to me and I'm not I'm not making an opinion on it, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=543.84s)]
*  but I've read a lot on it. And a lot of people think that that's unlikely. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=547.76s)]
*  Some of it will come back. I think some of it will come back. Yeah, some of that land will come back. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=551.12s)]
*  Who are you with? Sorry. Yeah. You know, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=558.72s)]
*  AFP, Agence France-Presse. OK, I just wanted to ask you, you, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=562.4s)]
*  the things that the Secretary of Defense was talking about, the 2014 borders and the [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=568.88s)]
*  lack of NATO membership. Ultimately, these are both the ones that Russia has made in the past. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=575.52s)]
*  Is there not a danger of handing Russia a kind of win on this? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=580.64s)]
*  Well, I think that if you look at the war, the way the war is going, you'll have to make your [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=585.84s)]
*  own determination. I'm just here to try and get peace. I don't care so much about anything [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=590.0s)]
*  other than I want to stop having millions of people killed. Killed. Last night, you know, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=595.68s)]
*  Kiev got hit very, very hard. I want to see people stop getting killed. That war is ridiculous. It [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=601.68s)]
*  should have never happened and it would have never happened. Yeah. A couple of more questions. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=607.36s)]
*  Are you planning to sign an executive order and a reciprocal terror, sir? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=613.84s)]
*  Yes, I am. In fact, I may do it today. And if I do it today, I could almost do it right now. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=617.28s)]
*  Would you like to talk about it? I don't want to take anything away from this young lady's [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=622.24s)]
*  day because this is her day and I may do it later on or I may do it tomorrow morning, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=626.56s)]
*  but we'll be signing reciprocal tariffs. The world has taken advantage of the United States [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=631.4399999999999s)]
*  for many years. They've charged us massive tariffs that we haven't charged them. And as you know, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=637.04s)]
*  I just did something on steel and aluminum, 25 percent. That'll go up at some point, but 25 [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=642.48s)]
*  percent, which will level the playing field quite a bit. I did it previously, 50 percent, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=649.84s)]
*  and Obama was very weak and Biden was even weaker on steel. The steel was just absolutely, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=655.2s)]
*  it really started with Obama. The world really took advantage of us and then that morphed into [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=663.6s)]
*  Biden. And what they did was he was so worried about trying to attack his political opponent [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=669.68s)]
*  that he didn't know what he was doing with respect to countries taking advantage. He should have [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=676.9599999999999s)]
*  looked at the countries, both friend and foe, taking advantage of us. So we're going to be [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=681.4399999999999s)]
*  doing reciprocal tariffs, which is whatever they charge, we charge very simply. But we're going to [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=687.92s)]
*  be talking about widespread fraud and abuse. Oh, yeah. Tremendous fraud. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=692.3199999999999s)]
*  There's tremendous fraud. And it's hard to believe that you can have that kind of fraud. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=699.6s)]
*  You're talking about like, are you talking about what? Wait, wait, wait. Which are you talking? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=704.4s)]
*  You're talking about with regard to all of the investigations that are going on about this [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=710.56s)]
*  stupidity. What we're going to do is tomorrow I'm having a news conference. I'm going to read to you [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=714.72s)]
*  some of the names that hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars have been given to. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=720.0799999999999s)]
*  And if you tell me that we should be giving money to those things, those entities, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=725.76s)]
*  I think you'll probably have to leave as a reporter because you're not very talented. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=730.5600000000001s)]
*  When you look at the kind of money, billions and billions of dollars being thrown away illegally, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=734.88s)]
*  and there's no there's no chance. I mean, I say it in front of our [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=740.8000000000001s)]
*  attorney general, there's no chance that there's not kickbacks or something going on. When you [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=745.2800000000001s)]
*  give millions and millions of dollars to somebody that stands to look at something for 15 minutes [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=750.0s)]
*  and walks away with millions of dollars, that money's coming back in some form. And that's only [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=756.0s)]
*  one form of corruption. The biggest thing is what they do to our country. They're taking [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=762.0s)]
*  massive amounts of money and spending it on items. I went through a list of 200 [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=768.24s)]
*  expenditures that were made and I found three that looked like they were reasonable. Okay, three. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=773.84s)]
*  And we'll be talking about that tomorrow. We have a lot of stuff and I want to commend [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=780.4s)]
*  Elon because he's done a fantastic. He doesn't need this. You know, he's abused by you people [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=784.72s)]
*  every day. He's found more things than anybody could find. I think he's got the credibility [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=788.96s)]
*  to do it. I know he does. And it's his group of people. You know, they started off with 12. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=794.32s)]
*  I call them 12 geniuses. They started off with 12 and they went to 20 and 25 and now they're up to [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=801.92s)]
*  almost 100 people adjoining to help them because there's a massive fraud that's taken place. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=807.2s)]
*  And then you have judges that are activists and they sit there and they say, oh, as an example, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=813.76s)]
*  59 million dollars going to a little small group in New York City. You get nothing going to North [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=819.0400000000001s)]
*  Carolina to help them. Nothing. They say we don't have any money because they've given it away on [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=826.48s)]
*  the border. But you have nothing. What they did to North Carolina is a shame. And then they sent [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=831.2s)]
*  59 million dollars to New York City for a hotel for a little a little bit of nothing. What they've [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=836.48s)]
*  done a hotel that was not luxury that's getting luxury rates for migrants where they're making a [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=843.12s)]
*  fortune and we catch them. We catch them. And but a judge says, well, even though it may be a fraud, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=849.76s)]
*  you have to send the money in anyway. Send the money. I said, wait a minute. We have money [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=858.16s)]
*  that shouldn't go because we caught it before it was sent out. But they want the money to go anyway. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=863.28s)]
*  And I think you're going to have a lot of things to look at, Pam. I really do. What's going on with [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=869.28s)]
*  this whole thing? And this is just one group. We haven't talked about Department of Education. We [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=875.84s)]
*  haven't talked about the military. We haven't talked about a lot of things that are very big. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=881.1999999999999s)]
*  And what's happened is, as an example, you'll have cases where you have a three-month contract [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=886.3199999999999s)]
*  and maybe the guy that signs a contract leaves. Maybe he gets rich. All of a sudden he leaves [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=893.12s)]
*  for that reason. But you have a three-month contract and maybe he leaves. So the contract [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=898.48s)]
*  is sitting there and the people signing the checks don't know it's three months and it goes [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=903.04s)]
*  on for years. The three months turns out to be three years, five years, 10 years. Just goes on [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=907.92s)]
*  forever. And the guy on the other side of the contract just keeps getting check after check [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=915.68s)]
*  after check because Elon had an expression yesterday because nobody cares. It's a great [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=921.12s)]
*  expression. Nobody cares. The guy that signed the contract didn't care. Maybe there, may not be there. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=927.36s)]
*  Maybe crooked. Who knows? But you have to care. Otherwise you can't really run a thing like that [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=933.36s)]
*  or you can't run a country, really. Because there's so many transactions, thousands and thousands of [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=940.08s)]
*  transactions. And if you don't have people that care, you're going to lose control. And that's [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=946.32s)]
*  what's happened and we've caught it. Now, what we caught is billions and billions of dollars, but [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=952.0s)]
*  it's a tiny fraction of the real number. Because you can never catch the real number because people [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=958.6400000000001s)]
*  have gotten away with tremendous amounts of money. But I said we have to make our government smaller, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=964.1600000000001s)]
*  more efficient, more effective and a lot less expensive. And we could find a trillion dollars, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=971.36s)]
*  but we're being hindered by courts where they file in certain courts where it's very hard to win [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=977.44s)]
*  and a judge will stop us and a judge will say that it doesn't make any difference what you find. You [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=984.32s)]
*  just keep paying the money. That's a hell of a way to be. And I follow the courts. I have to follow [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=990.5600000000001s)]
*  the law. All it means is that we appeal. But that gives people time to cover their tracks. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=995.68s)]
*  And that's what they do. So it's a very bad thing that's taking place. But hopefully if the courts [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1002.4s)]
*  will be fair. They don't have to be very fair. They just have to be a little bit fair because [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1010.2399999999999s)]
*  this is so egregious what's taking place. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. Nobody's seen numbers [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1014.0s)]
*  like this. These are massive numbers. Nine million dollars for somebody to go and stand in a store [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1019.76s)]
*  and see how people shop. Okay? I mean, you take a look at these things. It's a disgrace. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1025.28s)]
*  And then you have a country that we want to make America great again. It's very hard to make America [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1033.84s)]
*  great again when you have things like this. And you're going to see the same thing. Department of [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1039.04s)]
*  Education is going to be a disaster. The military. I mean, I see it. Look, I bought, I came in. They [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1042.88s)]
*  had a contract done, as you know, for 5.7 billion for airplanes. It was Air Force One with Boeing. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1050.4s)]
*  5.7. I got it down to 4 billion. A little less than that. One penny less than that. 3 billion, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1059.44s)]
*  9.99, 9.99, and 99 cents. They said, I said, has to have a three in front of it because I wouldn't [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1066.0s)]
*  sign the contract for 5.7 billion. I was able to cut 1.7 billion dollars off the price. And it [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1072.24s)]
*  didn't take me long. 1.7 billion. If people would care, they'd be able to do that with every single [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1081.76s)]
*  contract that's put before them. And we wouldn't have deficits. We'd have nothing but a tremendously [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1088.24s)]
*  low-taxed, wonderful country. But they have to care. And speaking of that, you know, Boeing, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1095.12s)]
*  we're not happy with the service we're getting in terms of those planes. They would like to get more [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1102.0s)]
*  money. We're not happy about that whole thing. We signed a very strong contract. I signed a [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1109.1999999999998s)]
*  guaranteed maximum contract, which I haven't seen in a long time. And they're saying they're getting [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1114.8s)]
*  hurt by it. But they have to produce the product, and we expect them to produce the product. They [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1120.96s)]
*  have to produce the product. They agreed to build planes at a certain price. They're not used to [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1127.1200000000001s)]
*  that. They're used to having time and material contracts where it's whatever it costs, time and [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1131.1200000000001s)]
*  material, no dates, no anything, and it ends up costing five times more. You look at some of the [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1137.76s)]
*  ships that have been built. Look at, take a look at the Gerald Ford, the aircraft carrier, the Ford. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1143.1200000000001s)]
*  It came, it was supposed to cost three billion. It ends up costing like 18 billion. And they make, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1150.0s)]
*  of course, all electric catapults, which don't work. And they have all magnetic elevators. They [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1156.0s)]
*  lift up 25 planes at a time, 20 planes at a time. And instead of using hydraulic, like on tractors, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1162.7199999999998s)]
*  that can handle anything from hurricanes to to lightning to anything, they use magnets. It's a [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1170.08s)]
*  new theory. Magnets are going to lift the planes up, and it doesn't work. And they had billions and [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1177.76s)]
*  billions of dollars of cost overruns. I met the architect. I said, have you designed a ship before? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1184.32s)]
*  This is one of the biggest ships in the world. It's like landing at LaGuardia Airport. But [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1189.92s)]
*  you look at the kind of waste, fraud, and abuse that this country is going through, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1196.16s)]
*  and we have to straighten it out. We have great people going into the military in terms of [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1200.56s)]
*  we need ships, we need a lot of things. We have great people, we have business people going in. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1205.52s)]
*  But when you look at what's happened to our purchasing, the purchasing, and when you look [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1209.52s)]
*  at the USAID, when you look at the things that they're giving to them, the billions, the billions [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1215.92s)]
*  of dollars that they're giving to, and it doesn't make sense. It is interesting that when you're [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1223.44s)]
*  looking for fraud, you look at items, hundreds of items, and you'll find one or two maybe, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1230.24s)]
*  if you're lucky. Here's something where you look at data, and they're all fraudulent. You know, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1236.8000000000002s)]
*  by just looking at the topic, they're all fraudulent, except it's the opposite. You'll [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1242.5600000000002s)]
*  find one or two that's like a legitimate reason. So I just want to thank Elon for going through it. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1247.0400000000002s)]
*  I want to thank all the people that are working with him. You know, we have a big group of people. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1254.4s)]
*  I think the lowest IQ is about 160. That's very high. I think you have a couple of 182s in there. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1258.8s)]
*  But they're doing a fantastic job. They don't. He doesn't need it, and they don't need it. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1266.96s)]
*  But we're showing things, and it's going to be a big... People have no idea how important it is. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1271.6s)]
*  Yeah. How soon do you want the Department of Education to be closed? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1277.76s)]
*  Oh, I'd like it to be closed immediately. Look, the Department of Education is a big con job. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1282.0s)]
*  We're ranked... So they rank the top 40 countries in the world. We're ranked number 40th. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1287.28s)]
*  But we're ranked number one in one department, cost per pupil. So we spend more per pupil than [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1292.32s)]
*  any other country in the world, but we're ranked number 40. We've been between 38 and 40. The last [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1298.56s)]
*  time I looked, it was 38. And then I looked two days ago, it came out the new list. It came out [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1304.32s)]
*  at number 40. So we're ranked 40. Norway, Denmark, Sweden, I hate to say it, China, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1308.96s)]
*  as big as it is, it's ranked in the top five. And that's a primary competitor. We're ranked [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1316.56s)]
*  number 40. So if we're ranked number 40, that means something's really wrong, right? And I say, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1323.1200000000001s)]
*  send it back to Iowa, to Idaho, to Colorado. Send it back to places that... And there are a lot of [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1327.92s)]
*  Indiana. You have a great new governor. You have a great senator that Jim Banks just got elected. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1336.24s)]
*  You got great people. I'll tell you what, Indiana is going to be fantastic. We probably have 35, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1343.04s)]
*  maybe 37 states that will do as well as Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden. They'll be just as good. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1350.32s)]
*  Then you have the ones that we all know about. It'll be the same story. But you know what? Even [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1359.68s)]
*  they will be good because you look at New York, you give it to Westchester County, you give it to [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1365.28s)]
*  Long Island, you give it to Nassau County, you give it to Suffolk County. Same thing you go out to [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1369.84s)]
*  and you give it to upstate New York. So you'd have four or five sections. You give it to Manhattan. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1374.6399999999999s)]
*  Manhattan's a little bit tougher for some reason. I don't know why it would be tougher, but it is. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1379.6s)]
*  You give to California and you go to various areas outside of Los Angeles and you might have [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1384.08s)]
*  six or seven different subgroups. But generally, like if you go to Iowa, you give it to Iowa. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1391.52s)]
*  You don't have subgroups, you have Iowa and other places that do a good job. If they do a good job, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1397.44s)]
*  they're going to do a great job in education. Those places will be every good, every bit as good as [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1403.76s)]
*  the various countries that do so well. All the time, it's the same countries [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1410.0s)]
*  that are doing well. And so we have a Department of Education where people from Washington, D.C. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1414.4s)]
*  who in many cases don't care about the kids out in the country. They don't care about the farms and [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1422.08s)]
*  the farmer's daughter and the farmer's sons. We have a massive bureaucracy in Washington, D.C. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1429.12s)]
*  We have buildings that are all over the city. Department of Education. I never said... [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1435.44s)]
*  Department of Education's in all these buildings. By the way, nobody shows up to work because they're [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1439.92s)]
*  all working at home. You know, quote, working at home. They're not working at home. And a lot of [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1444.56s)]
*  them have second jobs. And that's the other thing that Elon Musk is looking at. How many of these [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1449.92s)]
*  people are getting checks, working at home, but they're not working because they have second jobs [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1454.48s)]
*  and even third jobs? You're going to find a lot of them. And those people are going to be fired [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1459.44s)]
*  because we have to make our government smaller. All right. One more question. Yeah, Jennifer, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1463.68s)]
*  go ahead. Nice to see you. Oh, thank you, sir. Two questions. One on Ukraine again, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1468.88s)]
*  and then another one on the Kennedy Center. Do you think that by, as far as your negotiating [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1473.8400000000001s)]
*  tactics go, did Pete Hegseth take away some of your negotiating abilities with Putin by taking [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1479.44s)]
*  Ukraine's sovereign integrity off the table by taking... No, I haven't done that. I'm back in [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1486.96s)]
*  Ukraine. I'm back in Ukraine. Don't say that. I'm approving, but I do want security for our money. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1491.2s)]
*  You know, Europe is getting security. You know that, right? They're giving their money in the [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1499.04s)]
*  form of a loan. Nobody knows that. And why are we at $350 billion and Europe, which doesn't [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1502.64s)]
*  separate with an ocean like we do, we have a little thing called an ocean in between. Why is [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1510.24s)]
*  it that Europe is paying $200 billion less than us to help Ukraine? Very similar size. If you add [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1515.2800000000002s)]
*  up all the European countries, it's a little bit smaller than the U.S. in terms of the economy. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1522.3200000000002s)]
*  Why is it that they're not paying the kind of numbers that they should be paying? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1527.8400000000001s)]
*  And then on top of it, and I've been saying this to Biden, I told Biden, I said, you ought to be [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1532.64s)]
*  asking for either a loan or some kind of a security, like their oil and gas or something for the money, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1537.44s)]
*  because you're putting up much more money than Europe and you have no security. Europe's putting [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1543.44s)]
*  up a much smaller amount, and it's in the form of a loan because we have people that were [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1549.28s)]
*  incompetent in the last administration, grossly incompetent, and we're changing it. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1555.2s)]
*  But we change it and all we do is we get hit by lawsuits from the radical left all the time. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1562.0s)]
*  But here we are. We stand and I guess we've done okay. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1567.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1572.32s)]
*  I met O'Keefe in Washington. That was President Trump in the Oval Office. This was tape, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1580.96s)]
*  we call tape playback of a ceremony that happened in the last hour there. He swore in [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1587.36s)]
*  or witnessed the swearing in of his new director of national intelligence, the former Hawaii [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1593.52s)]
*  Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. The president, the headline coming out of this really is that after [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1597.28s)]
*  that swearing in, you saw there he took questions and he told reporters he will probably meet with [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1602.08s)]
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia at some point in the near future. We should point [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1606.72s)]
*  out, you may wonder why Saudi Arabia? They've been involved in the ongoing war in Ukraine and trying [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1613.04s)]
*  to seek a resolution to it, in part because Saudi Arabia in the Arab world was the biggest customer [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1619.36s)]
*  of Ukraine's agricultural exports. And so it has had a keen concern about the future of that war [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1626.3200000000002s)]
*  and its ability Saudi Arabia and other countries in that region to feed themselves. So Mohammed bin [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1632.3200000000002s)]
*  Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, apparently involved in the president signaling there in his [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1637.8400000000001s)]
*  comments that he and the Russian president may meet at some point soon in Saudi Arabia, when exactly [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1642.5600000000002s)]
*  remains to be seen. I should point out Ramadan begins at the end of this month, so conceivably [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1649.1200000000001s)]
*  it might have to happen before then, which would mean that they've only really got about two and a [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1653.92s)]
*  half weeks to go. He also gave a few more details on the release of Mark Fogel, the American who [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1657.76s)]
*  came home last night, and notably, and this is something that's going to send ricochets across [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1662.72s)]
*  Europe especially, he suggested that Ukraine is quote, unlikely to get back to its pre-2014 borders [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1666.8000000000002s)]
*  that of course have been overrun by Russia over the course of the nearly three-year conflict [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1674.4s)]
*  between those two countries saying quote, I think some of that land will come back, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1679.44s)]
*  but that Vladimir Zelensky, who he spoke with as well earlier today, may have to give a little. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1683.92s)]
*  I'm joined by Nicole Killian, who's on Capitol Hill and was watching this with all of us. Nicole, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1689.68s)]
*  notable that the confirmation vote on Tulsi Gabbard happened earlier today, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1696.0800000000002s)]
*  and she was sworn in so quickly. She got by with the 50 plus needed, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1702.0s)]
*  but there was one notable Republican defection, was there not? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1708.4799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's right, and you also heard the president there say or acknowledge that he [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1712.32s)]
*  didn't necessarily want to steal Tulsi Gabbard's thunder by taking all of those questions, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1716.6399999999999s)]
*  realizing that it's a significant day for her being confirmed as the director of national [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1722.8s)]
*  intelligence, but yes, that one lone Republican senator who did not back her bid was Senator [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1727.84s)]
*  Mitch McConnell, who cited her alarming lapses in judgment and said that he believes that of [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1734.08s)]
*  course the role of the Senate is to advise and consent, but that the Senate shouldn't consent [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1741.04s)]
*  if they believe a candidate is underqualified, and so in his view he felt that Gabbard simply [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1746.48s)]
*  wasn't up to the task, considering that this is a significant position in terms of overseeing the [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1753.36s)]
*  nation's intelligence, providing the president's daily brief, and he believed that her views were [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1758.8s)]
*  tainted. Now she did go through the gauntlet in terms of that confirmation hearing a couple of [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1765.36s)]
*  weeks ago, where she was really pressed about her own stances about Russia and the war with Ukraine, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1769.84s)]
*  where she was pressed about a visit she made to Syria, her views about FISA and government [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1776.16s)]
*  surveillance, as well as whether or not she believed that former government leaker Edward [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1782.5600000000002s)]
*  Snowden was a traitor, and while she didn't go so far as to say that, in subsequent conversations [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1787.1200000000001s)]
*  and exchanges with lawmakers, she appeared to ease some of their concerns, whether that was Maine's [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1792.88s)]
*  Susan Collins, Alaska's Lisa Murkowski, Indiana's Todd Young, a former intelligence official in the [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1798.72s)]
*  Marine Corps, so from that standpoint that seemed to make them more comfortable in supporting her [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1805.12s)]
*  bid, and so that is why ultimately she was able to secure enough votes to advance, even though [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1810.8s)]
*  McConnell defected. Quick, Nicole, we got about a minute to go here. Many lawmakers are leaving [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1816.8799999999999s)]
*  either tonight or early tomorrow to go to what's called the Munich Security Conference in Germany, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1824.6399999999999s)]
*  where Ukraine is going to be discussed, and I'm curious when they hear him talking now about a [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1830.32s)]
*  possible negotiation and the end of this conflict, and the defense secretary earlier today saying [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1836.08s)]
*  Ukraine may never get back its original borders, how's that going to go over on Capitol Hill? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1840.64s)]
*  Yeah, well certainly, you know, I think it depends who you talk to. Obviously those who have been [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1845.2s)]
*  ardent supporters of Ukraine and believe in defending its sovereignty aren't likely to side [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1851.28s)]
*  with the president on this, but as we have seen time and again, particularly with Republican [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1857.76s)]
*  members of the conference, whether we're talking about the Senate or the House, we have often kind [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1863.44s)]
*  of eventually kind of been to the president's position, so that is something to watch going [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1869.36s)]
*  forward, although historically there has been bipartisan support for Ukraine for providing [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1874.64s)]
*  additional assistance to Ukraine, so it certainly raises a number of questions that lawmakers here [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1879.84s)]
*  on Capitol Hill may have as the president potentially tries to move ahead in negotiating [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1885.68s)]
*  some potential ceasefire or end to this war. All right, Nicole Killian, thank you for that. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVpg0kSiOhE&t=1892.96s)]
