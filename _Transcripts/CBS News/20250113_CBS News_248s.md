# Justice Department releases Hunter Biden special counsel report
**CBS News:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA)
*  We're following some breaking news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=0.0s)]
*  The Justice Department has released special counsel David Weiss's final report into his [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=1.84s)]
*  investigations into Hunter Biden. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=6.3s)]
*  CBS News Justice Department reporter Rob Legary joins us now. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=8.52s)]
*  So this is the investigation into both the gun charges and the tax case. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=11.72s)]
*  Hunter was obviously pardoned by his father, President Biden, last month. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=16.76s)]
*  But what I found really interesting in what the parts of the report that I've read so [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=19.72s)]
*  far is it's pretty scathing into the president's comments that he made about sort of the politicization [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=23.76s)]
*  of the Justice Department. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=30.12s)]
*  What do the reports say about that? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=31.12s)]
*  Yeah, hey, Lindsey, good evening. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=34.0s)]
*  So so to your point, when President Biden pardoned his son, he alleged that the investigation [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=35.24s)]
*  into his son's actions, particularly a gun investigation about illegally applying for [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  a gun license under the influence of drugs and tax evasion in California, both of those [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=45.8s)]
*  cases, the president alleged were, quote, raw politics. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=51.0s)]
*  Well, the special counsel tonight in his report submitted to the attorney general takes that [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=53.44s)]
*  on, takes those criticisms of the sitting president head on, alleging that such claims [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=57.88s)]
*  impugn the dignity of special counsel employees and Justice Department employees and said, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=62.28s)]
*  quote, they are wrong. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=67.16s)]
*  And so he's really taking the criticisms of the president head on here and defends [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=68.16s)]
*  his prosecutorial decisions. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  You'll remember the special counsel came under criticism from both Republicans and Democrats [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=73.88s)]
*  for various aspects of his investigation. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=78.44s)]
*  Here he explains that he adhered to what he says are the Justice Department's principles [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  of federal prosecution and stand by stands by all of his decisions. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=85.6s)]
*  What do the reports say about the gun attacks and gun charges against Biden? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  Right. Well, he does list out and again, we're still reading through this, but the special [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=94.08s)]
*  counsel's list out all. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's long. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=100.44s)]
*  Luckily, the report itself is a bit shorter. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  We have a lot of appendices to go through as well. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=103.39999999999999s)]
*  But what we do know in his defense of both charges is that both indictments against the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=105.56s)]
*  president's son, Hunter, is that he lists out the evidence that led to the charges, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=110.36s)]
*  importantly, in a lot of these reports from special counsels to the attorney general, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=114.96s)]
*  which we may be getting more in the next few days. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=119.91999999999999s)]
*  The the special the investigators have to explain why they decided to do these things. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  They have to tell the attorney general, I decided to bring these charges, which are [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=128.44s)]
*  in public court records because of the evidence and then list the evidence again and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=132.48s)]
*  summarize it as listed in the indictment. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=137.0s)]
*  So here on the gun and tax charges, the special counsel says that both led to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  both led to indictments and then says the guilty plea on the gun, excuse me, the guilty [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=144.88s)]
*  conviction by a jury in Delaware in the gun case and the guilty plea on the tax evasion [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=149.11999999999998s)]
*  charge in California are evidence that those cases were properly brought. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=153.88s)]
*  Yeah, one of the pages simply says I prosecuted the two cases against Mr. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  Biden because he broke the law. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  All right, there's a lot of news in your world. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=163.32s)]
*  I want to shift now to the report on Trump from special counsel Jack Smith. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  How soon could we see volume one? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  So volume one is into, I believe, election interference, not the classified documents [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  case. What information can we expect to be included in that? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  Right. Well, to your question on how soon Judge Eileen Cannon's order preventing the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=180.32s)]
*  release of the volume one of the report by the Justice Department expires tonight at [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=183.6s)]
*  midnight. And so we could see that as early as today, excuse me, as tonight at midnight. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=188.92s)]
*  But that that remains to be seen again. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=193.16s)]
*  These reports have to be transmitted by the attorney general to Congress. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  We know the attorney general has that report because Jack Smith said in a court filing [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=199.0s)]
*  last week that he submitted it to the attorney general and was completed. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=202.56s)]
*  That first volume deals with Trump's conduct after the twenty twenty election. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=205.68s)]
*  The second deals with his handling of classified records. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  So what should we expect in that first volume? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=211.68s)]
*  We should expect quite similar to what we see here in David Weiss's report. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=213.72s)]
*  Explanations of charging decisions, explanations and maybe some clarity around [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=217.52s)]
*  evidence that was collected by federal prosecutors and federal investigators. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=223.72s)]
*  And finally, potentially some better explanations about why the special counsel [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=227.12s)]
*  Jack, excuse me, the former special counsel, Jack Smith, took the decision she did [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=231.8s)]
*  in the Supreme Court and other cases in which they were arguing about presidential [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  immunity. Hopefully we'll get some clarity there when, however, remains to be seen [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=239.0s)]
*  for right now. OK, Rob, Gary, busy week in your world. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=243.12s)]
*  Thank you so much. Thanks. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWvTRlmsckA&t=245.64000000000001s)]
