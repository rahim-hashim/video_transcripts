# Trump signs Laken Riley Act targeting more immigrants for deportation
**CBS News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8)
*  I want to take you now to the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump is signing the immigration bill inspired by Lakin Reilly. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=2.44s)]
*  The presidents have tried very hard to do but failed. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=5.44s)]
*  Most of the people we're talking about have not been going to their federal offices in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=9.76s)]
*  many, many years, from even before COVID. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=13.8s)]
*  But they have nevertheless been paid. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=17.88s)]
*  Some have worked, some haven't worked. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  And most of the studies say that some have just gone through the motions. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=22.6s)]
*  We may ask these people to prove that they didn't have another job during their so-called [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=29.16s)]
*  employment with the United States of America because if they did, that would be unlawful, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=34.96s)]
*  as you understand. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=39.32s)]
*  A lot of people are getting paychecks but they're actually working other jobs. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=40.32s)]
*  So they'll have to prove that to us that they weren't. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=44.76s)]
*  In any event, we're requiring them to show up to work or be terminated. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=47.36s)]
*  We think a very substantial number of people will not show up to work and therefore our [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=53.16s)]
*  government will get smaller and more efficient. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=57.12s)]
*  And that's what we've been looking to do for many, many decades, frankly. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=60.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=66.0s)]
*  In addition, there was a short-term pause or funding freeze on certain discretionary [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=70.08s)]
*  spending payments such as government grants, only for us to quickly look at the scams, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=76.32s)]
*  waste and abuse that's taken place in our government for too long. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=83.83999999999999s)]
*  As was explicitly stated, this in no way affected Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid or other [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=88.24s)]
*  entitlements that Americans depend on. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=95.32s)]
*  I've made abundantly clear from the very first day that I ran from office, that was [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=98.24s)]
*  a long time ago now, that's 2015. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=103.39999999999999s)]
*  If you think about it, I announced in 2015 and we won in 2016. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=107.64s)]
*  We did very well in 2020, but we did really well just recently. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=113.36s)]
*  And I'm restating right now to correct any confusion that the media has purposely and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=117.88s)]
*  somehow for whatever reason created Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid have not been [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=123.94s)]
*  affected by any action we're taking in any way, shape or form. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=128.8s)]
*  We are merely looking at parts of the big bureaucracy where there has been tremendous [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=133.22s)]
*  waste and fraud and abuse. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=140.0s)]
*  In that process, we identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=143.02s)]
*  for Hamas. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=152.06s)]
*  $50 million. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=153.06s)]
*  And you know what's happened to them? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=155.1s)]
*  They've used them as a method of making bombs. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=157.14s)]
*  How about that? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=160.5s)]
*  We stopped an attempt to make an illicit payment for illegal alien resettlement. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=162.14s)]
*  We canceled $181 million in DEI training contracts. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=167.55999999999997s)]
*  This is just for the training of people in DEI, which has been terminated and completely [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=172.54s)]
*  terminated and we paused $1.7 billion in unauthorized payments to foreign organizations, including [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=177.88s)]
*  more than $40 million that was on its way out the door to the very corrupt World Health [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=186.3s)]
*  Organization, which has not done its job and not done it properly. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=193.22s)]
*  We also blocked $45 million for diversity scholarships in Burma. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=198.86s)]
*  $45 million. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=210.78s)]
*  That's a lot of money for diversity scholarships in Burma. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=211.78s)]
*  You can imagine where that money went. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=216.5s)]
*  These were the types of payments and many others. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=219.34s)]
*  I could stand here all day and tell you things that we found and we have to find them quickly [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=221.66s)]
*  because we want the money to flow to proper places. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=225.94s)]
*  But these were the payments and types of payments affected by the temporary freeze and the American [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=229.62s)]
*  people strongly support these efforts. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=234.22s)]
*  I talked about it during the campaign and they voted for us in record numbers. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=236.1s)]
*  Every single day we're now putting America first and fighting to get the most out of [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=241.46s)]
*  every single tax dollar for our great citizens. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=246.85999999999999s)]
*  We've gathered this afternoon to take another historic action. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=250.9s)]
*  However, in a few moments, the Lakin-Riley Act will become the very first bill that I [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=256.78s)]
*  proudly sign into law as the 47th President of the United States. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=264.78000000000003s)]
*  Lakin was a brilliant and beautiful 22-year-old nursing student from Georgia. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=281.78000000000003s)]
*  The best in her class. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=287.82s)]
*  She was always the best. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=289.1s)]
*  They would say, Lakin, how do you do this? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=290.3s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=294.22s)]
*  They were always asking her questions. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=295.22s)]
*  She was respected by everybody, even her teachers. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=296.38s)]
*  They respected her so much from the time she was in first grade. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=299.14s)]
*  Lakin knew she wanted to spend her time caring for others. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=303.94s)]
*  That's what she did. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=307.78000000000003s)]
*  To her friends and classmates, she was a light of warmth and kindness in every single room. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=309.06s)]
*  To her parents and family, she was everything in the world. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=315.06s)]
*  They had a miserable period of time. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=319.22s)]
*  Just after 9 a.m. last February 22nd, Lakin went out for a jog on the campus of the University [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=323.26000000000005s)]
*  of Georgia, but she was just never returned. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=329.94000000000005s)]
*  She never came back, did she? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=333.18s)]
*  Parents are here, sister, all of her relatives. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=336.42s)]
*  While on her run, Lakin was attacked, viciously assaulted, beaten, brutalized, and murdered [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=340.86s)]
*  by an illegal alien gang member who was set loose into our country by the last administration. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=346.74s)]
*  We are deeply honored to be joined today by Lakin's parents, Allison and John, and her [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=353.74s)]
*  sister Lauren. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=358.26s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=359.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=362.86s)]
*  So sad. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=366.86s)]
*  We were together right after that happened, and it's a tremendous tribute to your daughter [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=370.82s)]
*  what's taking place today. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=378.7s)]
*  That's all I can say. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=380.18s)]
*  But so sad we have to be doing it at all. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=381.18s)]
*  Thank you very much for being here. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=384.42s)]
*  To Lakin's family, we will keep Lakin's memory alive in our hearts forever, everyone's hearts. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=386.94s)]
*  With today's action, her name will also live forever in the laws of our country, and this [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=394.06s)]
*  is a very important law. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=399.38s)]
*  This is something that has brought Democrats and Republicans together. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=401.02s)]
*  That's not easy to do. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=405.5s)]
*  Lakin did it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=406.86s)]
*  Lakin did it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=407.86s)]
*  America will never, ever forget Lakin Hope Riley, the vicious criminal who murdered precious [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=409.78s)]
*  Lakin was an illegal alien member of the barbaric Venezuelan prison gang known as Trende [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=416.06s)]
*  Aragua. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=422.65999999999997s)]
*  He trespassed across our southern border in 2022 and was apprehended by Border Patrol, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=424.66s)]
*  but under the cruel policies of the last administration, instead of being deported as he should have [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=432.02000000000004s)]
*  been, he was released into the United States as were millions of other people, many of [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=437.54s)]
*  them very dangerous people. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=445.42s)]
*  And you see what we're doing. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=448.18s)]
*  We're getting the hell out of here. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=449.34s)]
*  He was soon arrested again in New York City on charges of endangering a child, but because [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=453.17999999999995s)]
*  of New York City's deadly sanctuary policies, as we have in California and many other places, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=465.97999999999996s)]
*  which we're ending, we're going to end them. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=472.29999999999995s)]
*  He was released again to reoffend the Biden administration, then provided this illegal [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=474.74s)]
*  alien criminal with a free taxpayer funded flight from New York to Georgia where he was [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=480.58s)]
*  arrested yet again, constantly this time for stealing from a Walmart along with his gang [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=486.18s)]
*  member brother, who was a bad one. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=492.46000000000004s)]
*  Only after being released a third time by the U.S. law enforcement did this cold blooded [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=495.98s)]
*  criminal go out in that fateful morning hunting for women on whom to prey. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=500.70000000000005s)]
*  That's what he did. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=507.3s)]
*  He hunted. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=508.3s)]
*  He hunted. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=509.3s)]
*  It was like a hunter. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=510.3s)]
*  I'm going to show him who the hunter is. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=511.3s)]
*  This horrific atrocity should never have been allowed to happen. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=514.26s)]
*  And as president, I'm fighting every single day to ensure that such a tragedy never happens [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=517.82s)]
*  again. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=522.62s)]
*  We don't want this to happen. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=523.62s)]
*  And under the law. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=524.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=532.3s)]
*  Under the law I'm signing today, the Department of Homeland Security will be required to detain [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=533.3s)]
*  all illegal aliens who have been arrested for theft, burglary, larceny, shoplifting, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=538.5s)]
*  assaulting a police officer, murder or any crime that results in death or a serious injury. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=545.98s)]
*  In addition, for the first time ever, this act gives state governments the ability to [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=552.58s)]
*  sue the federal government for immediate injunctive relief if any future administration ever again [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=557.14s)]
*  refuses to enforce the immigration laws of the United States like happened for four long [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=563.3s)]
*  years. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=569.54s)]
*  And that was happening for four long years, frightful years. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=576.38s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=582.1s)]
*  You'd say, how can people do this? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=583.1s)]
*  How can they allow this to happen? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=585.26s)]
*  How can they allow criminals to pour into our country and then try and defend it? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=586.74s)]
*  And they're still trying to defend it, but they can't. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=591.28s)]
*  That's why I'm here instead of somebody else, actually. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=594.6s)]
*  It's the biggest reason. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=597.34s)]
*  I believe it's the single biggest reason. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=598.34s)]
*  Inflation was horrible. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=600.34s)]
*  Many things were horrible during that administration. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=601.66s)]
*  When you look at what took place in Afghanistan, the way they got out, not that they got out, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=604.56s)]
*  but the way so many things were horrible. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=609.1999999999999s)]
*  But to me, this was the worst of all. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=611.9s)]
*  It's a landmark law that we're doing today. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=614.7199999999999s)]
*  It's going to save countless innocent American lives. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=617.92s)]
*  I want to thank every House Republican, every Senate Republican, as well as the 12 Senate [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=622.0799999999999s)]
*  Democrats and the 48 House Democrats who voted to pass this vitally important bill and many [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=627.9599999999999s)]
*  of them are with us today. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=634.0799999999999s)]
*  I really do appreciate it. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=635.5s)]
*  I very much especially appreciate the bipartisan support. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=637.5s)]
*  The Democrats, really a big percentage of them came through and plenty of them wanted [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=641.0799999999999s)]
*  to. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=645.52s)]
*  They probably felt they couldn't, but they really wanted to. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=646.52s)]
*  They don't understand that it would have made them a lot more popular, would have made them [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=649.56s)]
*  a lot better with their people. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=653.92s)]
*  The ones that didn't are going to be, they're going to be sorry because the people are not [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=656.92s)]
*  going to forget that they wouldn't sign. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=662.28s)]
*  This is a perfect, incredible tribute to an unbelievable young lady. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=663.88s)]
*  We're joined today by many great supporters of our new strong border policies and they [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=670.28s)]
*  are indeed strong, including Vice President Vance. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=675.12s)]
*  Thank you, JD. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=679.88s)]
*  The Secretary, Scott Besson, who just got approved, by the way. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=681.56s)]
*  Where's Scott? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=684.8s)]
*  He just got approved. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=685.8s)]
*  Scott, I'm very impressed. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=686.8s)]
*  Got a lot of Democrat votes here. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=688.8s)]
*  He got a lot of Democrat votes. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=692.7199999999999s)]
*  I don't know, is that a good thing or a bad thing? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=694.7199999999999s)]
*  I'll have to think about that. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=697.1999999999999s)]
*  Secretary of Homeland Security, who's going to be fantastic. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=699.8s)]
*  I know her so well and I know it's probably not complimentary because she is a woman, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=703.12s)]
*  but she is tough. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=708.8s)]
*  Where is she? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=710.4799999999999s)]
*  Where is Christy? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=711.4799999999999s)]
*  Christy, Christy, great. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=712.4799999999999s)]
*  Stand up please. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=714.5999999999999s)]
*  You have such an important job to do. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=715.5999999999999s)]
*  Really great, thank you very much. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=722.8s)]
*  And don't let that look fool you. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=725.0s)]
*  That look is, she's tough and she cannot stand that she's having to sit here and even listen [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=726.8s)]
*  to this today. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=734.0s)]
*  Another one who's done a job like nobody that I've seen in a long time, Tom Homan, he's [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=736.0s)]
*  my friend, but he is something special. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=741.4s)]
*  He's something special. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=744.8s)]
*  Great. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=748.8s)]
*  And Tom and Christy, the numbers are unbelievable what's happened. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=751.8s)]
*  It's like just shut down. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=754.8s)]
*  Nobody thought that was even possible. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=756.8s)]
*  It's just shut down. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=757.8s)]
*  They showed an area that a year ago had thousands and thousands of people rushing into our country [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=758.8s)]
*  and today there was nobody there. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=765.8s)]
*  It was like a beautiful sight. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=767.8s)]
*  And also Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, great guy, great guy. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=770.8s)]
*  Thank you, John. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=774.8s)]
*  And I also want to thank the bill's sponsor, Senator Katie Britt. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=777.8s)]
*  Katie, thank you, Katie. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=783.8s)]
*  And Congressman Mike Collins. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=787.8s)]
*  And Mike, you were fantastic from Georgia. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=789.8s)]
*  He took this, he loves his state and he took this very personally. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=792.8s)]
*  So thank you very much, Mike. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=799.8s)]
*  As well as Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=801.8s)]
*  Chuck is here someplace. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=805.8s)]
*  Chuck, thank you very much. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=807.8s)]
*  You look great. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=809.8s)]
*  And House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, who is a special guy, special man. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=811.8s)]
*  And House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=819.8s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=823.8s)]
*  Thank you, Mark. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=824.8s)]
*  And we have many other congressmen and senators, but I'm not going to introduce because this [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=826.8s)]
*  is about your daughter. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=830.8s)]
*  This is about something that's so important and we're going to just go along. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=832.8s)]
*  Thank you also. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=837.8s)]
*  We have to say, Bert Jones is in the room and Bert is your Lieutenant Governor and he [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=838.8s)]
*  was on this like you wouldn't believe. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=843.8s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=845.8s)]
*  I see you sitting there. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=846.8s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=847.8s)]
*  So we have state local officials. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=851.8s)]
*  We have law enforcement organizations. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=853.8s)]
*  We have everybody. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=855.8s)]
*  Most of them are in the room or represented in the room and they're incredible people. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=856.8s)]
*  And I've never seen them come together like they have for this. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=861.8s)]
*  I've done many of these, not of this kind, but different bills, different passages having [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=864.8s)]
*  to do with many different things from Homeland Security to Inner Security to taxes to 50 [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=869.8s)]
*  different items. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=877.8s)]
*  I've never seen such support as you have today and as your great daughter has today. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=878.8s)]
*  So I've never seen anything like it. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=885.8s)]
*  We have to thank your daughter for that because she's going to save a lot of lives. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=888.8s)]
*  She's going to be responsible for saving a lot of lives. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=892.8s)]
*  So I'd like to just say to the Angel families, I've been with them and they've been with [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=895.8s)]
*  me from 2015 when I first got this crazy idea in my head to run for president because we [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=903.8s)]
*  can do better as a country. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=909.8s)]
*  I want to thank so many of the people that are here that have been the Angel moms and [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=910.8s)]
*  we call them Angel moms, but they're Angel families, fathers and sons and daughters. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=916.8s)]
*  But they've suffered tremendously like you have for no reason whatsoever. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=921.8s)]
*  I want to thank Alexis Nungari, the mother of 12 year old Jocelyn Nungari, murdered last [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=926.8s)]
*  summer by two illegal alien gang members released into the United States by Joe Biden's [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=933.8s)]
*  open border stupid policies. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=938.8s)]
*  And thank you very much, Alexis. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=941.8s)]
*  We've been watching President Trump. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=943.8s)]
*  He is expected to soon sign the Laken Reilly Act named after the nursing student who was [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=944.8s)]
*  murdered by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant last year. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=948.8s)]
*  The law adds nonviolent offenses, including burglary and shoplifting to the list of charges [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=951.8s)]
*  for which undocumented migrants can be detained and eventually deported. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=956.8s)]
*  It's the first piece of legislation to be signed by President Trump since taking the [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=960.8s)]
*  oath of office for a second term. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=964.8s)]
*  The bill received the support of 46 House Democrats and 12 senators, many from so-called [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=966.8s)]
*  battleground states where border reform is a key issue. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=970.8s)]
*  Most Democrats oppose the bill, saying it could be used to strip due process guarantees [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=973.8s)]
*  in the Constitution. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=977.8s)]
*  They also call the law an unfunded mandate since it does not allow for any way to pay [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=979.8s)]
*  for the increased enforcement. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=983.8s)]
*  The president also talked about the resettlement of a memo from the Office of Management and [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=985.8s)]
*  Budget that paused all federal funding, essentially froze it to nonprofits and governments not [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=990.8s)]
*  affecting individual payments for things like Social Security. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=997.8s)]
*  He said in response to the rescinding of the memo, which the White House press secretary [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1001.8s)]
*  says is not a rescinding of the freeze, just to the memo, meaning that the administration, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1006.8s)]
*  meaning we believe that the administration is still going to be taking a look at all [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1011.8s)]
*  programs and where government funding is going. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1014.8s)]
*  The president's saying that the whole point was to look at, in his words, scams, dishonesty [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1016.8s)]
*  taking place in our government. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1020.8s)]
*  He said parts of the big bureaucracy where there has been tremendous waste, fraud and [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1022.8s)]
*  abuse. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1026.8s)]
*  He claimed that millions of dollars are being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas, repeating [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1027.8s)]
*  a statement made by press secretary Caroline Levitt yesterday. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1031.8s)]
*  But according to the Times, who spoke with Andrew Miller, a deputy assistant secretary [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1034.8s)]
*  for Israeli-Palestinian affairs under former President Biden, he called the claim outlandish [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1039.8s)]
*  and said it's possible that money is being put aside for sexual health or something of [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1044.8s)]
*  that nature, which would include gynecology, but definitely not condoms alone. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1048.8s)]
*  They also found a U.S. aid report issued in September that said that millions in funding [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1053.8s)]
*  were allocated by U.S. aid for condoms and female contraceptives in 2023, but not a cent [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1059.8s)]
*  of that seems to have gone to Gaza. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1065.8s)]
*  Again, that is from the Times. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1067.8s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News White House reporter Olivia Rinaldi at the White House. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1069.8s)]
*  Olivia, let's go ahead first and talk about the bill at hand. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1073.8s)]
*  How significant is it that this is the first the president is signing in his second term? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1076.8s)]
*  Well, this is huge. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1081.8s)]
*  This is very significant for Trump that this is his first major piece of legislation that [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1082.8s)]
*  he is signing into office. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1087.8s)]
*  It's a bipartisan piece of legislation. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1089.8s)]
*  Our reporters in the room tell us that Senator John Federman, who was a huge proponent of [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1090.8s)]
*  this bill, was in the room for that signing, which was quite notable. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1095.8s)]
*  This makes good on a campaign promise. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1100.8s)]
*  You know, Trump made Lake and Riley really central to his reelection campaign and kind [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1102.8s)]
*  of a target and a focus of immigration specifically. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1108.8s)]
*  I was there at a rally in Rome, Georgia, back in March, I believe, when he brought up Lake [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1111.8s)]
*  and Riley's family just a week, just about a week after her unfortunate passing. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1116.8s)]
*  And it was raw and it was emotional and it was a huge moment. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1122.8s)]
*  And it's quite notable that, you know, here we are about 11 months later and he's signing [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1126.8s)]
*  in a law that has her name on it regarding immigration in this country. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1131.8s)]
*  Now, the law itself requires the detention of migrants by federal officials if they have [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1137.8s)]
*  committed a crime such as theft, arson, you know, burglary, anything of that sort, for [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1143.8s)]
*  them to be detained. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1150.8s)]
*  And of course, Trump is looking to create mass deportations across the country. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1152.8s)]
*  We're watching those unfold over the last several days that he's taken office. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1156.8s)]
*  So, quite notable that this is the first piece of legislation that he has signed in her name [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1161.8s)]
*  with her family there, as this was such a central focus point really to his reelection campaign. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1166.8s)]
*  Olivia, you had said committed a crime, but really the controversy here is that the detention [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1172.8s)]
*  could include not just conviction, but even being charged with one of those crimes, which [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1177.8s)]
*  is why some lawmakers were against this. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1181.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's why we saw some Democratic pushback just to clarify on that law exactly what it meant. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1184.8s)]
*  Let's go ahead and talk quickly about the president's remarks toward this idea of freezing funding. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1191.8s)]
*  It caused confusion when the memo was released on Monday evening. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1197.8s)]
*  Confusion still exists today because the administration is saying this doesn't rescind the order, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1203.8s)]
*  or it just rescinds the memo, but not sort of the act of looking at all these programs. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1208.8s)]
*  Can you elaborate on that, on what we know right now? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1212.8s)]
*  Yeah, the confusion persists on this particular issue. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1215.8s)]
*  We know, of course, yesterday that all federal funding was supposed to be paused until the [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1219.8s)]
*  Trump administration could really review all fundings and making sure that they're in line [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1224.8s)]
*  with their priorities and objectives as it relates to DEI, other spending of what Trump [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1229.8s)]
*  calls, quote, pet projects. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1236.8s)]
*  So that was their focus. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1238.8s)]
*  But it was unclear whether it related to Medicaid, Social Security, what states could access [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1239.8s)]
*  from the federal government. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1244.8s)]
*  Because the administration said it wouldn't affect those programs, but some states saw [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1246.8s)]
*  their Medicaid portals, essentially, their websites go down. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1249.8s)]
*  Yeah, even Virginia, which is run by a Republican governor, they clarified to me yesterday that [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1253.8s)]
*  their portal was down for a brief period of time, but they're not linking it to this [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1258.8s)]
*  federal funding pause. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1262.8s)]
*  So we got this statement just a short while ago from Caroline Lovett, the press secretary, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1264.8s)]
*  that I want to read, and she says, in light of the injunction that we saw yesterday from [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1268.8s)]
*  a federal judge asking for a blanket pause on the ceasing of federal funding until they [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1272.8s)]
*  could have a hearing about it, next Monday, she said, in light of that, the OMB rescinded [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1278.8s)]
*  the memo to end any confusion on the federal policy created by the court ruling. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1282.8s)]
*  All of this to say a lot of finger pointing regarding this federal funding, who it impacts, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1287.8s)]
*  what it impacts, and they say that there is still that freeze on it at this point in time [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1292.8s)]
*  so that they can still review each policy and what it impacts and if it's in line with [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1297.8s)]
*  Trump's agenda. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1302.8s)]
*  So we're still seeking some further clarity on exactly what this all means, but that confusion [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1304.8s)]
*  is persisting right now. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1309.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1311.8s)]
*  Olivia Rinaldi, thank you, as always. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9UFroEXS8&t=1312.8s)]
