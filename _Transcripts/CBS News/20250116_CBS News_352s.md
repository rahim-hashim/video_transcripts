# Anger at Blinken's farewell presser as Israel-Hamas truce start looms
**CBS News:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc)
*  Right now, Secretary of State Antony Blinken is delivering his farewell remarks from the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=0.0s)]
*  State Department. And just moments ago, he was heckled from the crowd about U.S. support [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=5.04s)]
*  for Israel. Let's play back that sound. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=10.64s)]
*  Finally, I just wanted to show you this morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=12.72s)]
*  Get your hands off me. Get your hands off me. Get your hands off me. Answer a damn question. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=15.64s)]
*  I look forward to answering questions in two minutes. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=22.0s)]
*  You know about Israel's nuclear weapons, everybody from the ICJ. I was sitting here quietly and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=23.8s)]
*  now I'm being manhandled by two or three people. You pontificate about a free press. You pontificate [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=28.68s)]
*  about a free press. You are hurting me. You are hurting me. You are hurting me. I am asking [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=35.68s)]
*  questions after being told by Matt Miller that he will not answer my questions until [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=42.68s)]
*  I ask him. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=46.68s)]
*  Please, sir, respect the process. We'll have an opportunity to take questions in a few [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=47.68s)]
*  minutes. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=51.68s)]
*  You know, I was at the point of the May 31st statement to block the ICJ orders. He blocked [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=52.68s)]
*  the ICJ orders. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=58.68s)]
*  Please, sir, respect the process. Thank you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=61.68s)]
*  Respect the process. Respect the process. Everybody from the International, from the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=63.68s)]
*  International to the ICJ saying that as well as doing genocide and extermination and you're [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=69.68s)]
*  telling me to respect the process. Criminal. Why aren't you in the Hague? Why aren't you [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=75.68s)]
*  in the Hague? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=81.68s)]
*  Well, security ended up escorting that individual out. CBS News White House reporter Willie [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=82.68s)]
*  James Inman joins us now. Willie, what, give us your take on what happened during those [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=88.68s)]
*  very tense moments. Was that individual a journalist? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=94.68s)]
*  Hey there, Liz. Good to be with you. A tense moment indeed. Now, to get access to the press [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=97.68s)]
*  briefing room at the State Department, you have to have the proper credentials. So presumably [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=105.68s)]
*  this person was a journalist, some type of journalist here in the D.C. area. It's unclear [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=110.68s)]
*  who this individual was. If we get those details, we'll make sure to bring them to you. But [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=115.68s)]
*  nonetheless, Secretary Antony Blinken being heckled in this sense in terms of the U.S.'s [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=119.68s)]
*  support of Israel. Now, he did mention during that briefing, he expressed that he's confident [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=126.68s)]
*  that this agreement between Hamas and Israel would be carried out as early as this Sunday. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=133.68s)]
*  We could see the first few hostages released after this deal came about. Now, this has [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=139.68s)]
*  been months, weeks worth of diplomacy. The Secretary of State has traveled to the region [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=144.68s)]
*  many times to bring about this deal. But it really was in the last few days that this [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=150.68s)]
*  came about, this deal between Hamas and Israel, the United States, Egypt, Qatar, other countries [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=156.68s)]
*  being involved in the region as well. President Biden sending his Middle East envoy, Brett [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=162.68s)]
*  McGurk, to the region and also President-elect Trump sending his appointed Middle Eastern [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=168.68s)]
*  envoy, Steve, he's sending his envoy, I should say, to Steve Wilcock to essentially help [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=173.68s)]
*  negotiate and bring about a little bit of pressure from the president-elect to hear [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=181.68s)]
*  his input in this agreement. Of course, I'll note that President Biden may have taken some [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=186.68s)]
*  of the credit, President-elect Trump trying to take some of the credit as well. But much [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=192.68s)]
*  of this agreement will be carried out under the Trump administration. It's important to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=195.68s)]
*  point that out because over the next several weeks, if this agreement does indeed happen, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=201.68s)]
*  it can fall apart at any moment. But if it does happen, those hostages, for the most part, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=205.68s)]
*  will be released once President-elect Trump is in office. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=209.68s)]
*  Yeah, it was interesting to watch this press briefing, Willie, only because, you know, he [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=212.68s)]
*  gave his statements. There were some hecklers. But then that first question, the reporter [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=216.68s)]
*  mentioned that the last time they were in a briefing like this with Condoleezza Rice, all [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=220.68s)]
*  of the questions were about the conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas, what's [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=225.68s)]
*  happening there in the region between Israel and Gaza. And today it was much of the same. So [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=230.68s)]
*  this has sort of been the same kind of tense situation that's going on there, maybe possibly [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=235.68s)]
*  today some sort of movement forward. But what else did you take out of that press briefing in [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=240.68s)]
*  terms of the future of the ceasefire deal? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=246.68s)]
*  Yeah, and it's interesting that you pointed out that question. That question was asked by [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=249.68s)]
*  Matt Miller, a reporter for the Associated Press. He is really an institution at the State [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=255.68s)]
*  Department. I've seen him. He asked these questions to many Secretary of State's over the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=261.68s)]
*  years. And it's really interesting to see all this wrap up. Secretary of State Antony Blinken [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=267.68s)]
*  has really has to pass the baton essentially. He's talked about a day after plan that he would [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=273.68s)]
*  present the incoming team with that would call for the reconstruction of Gaza, that would call [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=280.68s)]
*  for a security force composed of other nations to be able to go into Gaza and make sure to keep [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=286.68s)]
*  things safe. But still, nonetheless, we are here as we were years ago talking about Israel and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=293.68s)]
*  Gaza and this tense situation in the Middle East, although things certainly have changed a little [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=301.68s)]
*  bit since then with the Abraham Accords, the pathway towards normalization. Now, normalization [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=306.68s)]
*  between Israel and a country like Saudi Arabia, for instance, didn't happen in large part because [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=313.68s)]
*  of this situation that happened on October 7th, some 15 months ago. But still, nonetheless, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=318.68s)]
*  President Biden saying that the world is in a better spot than it was four years ago when he [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=325.68s)]
*  took office. But of course, President-elect Trump and his supporters might disagree with that, but [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=331.68s)]
*  the Secretary of State laying out some of the successes, the major accomplishments in his eyes [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=337.68s)]
*  in that briefing today, Liz, there at the State Department. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=342.68s)]
*  CBS News, White House reporter Willie James Inman. Thanks so much, Willie. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHcm7ejCKJc&t=346.68s)]
