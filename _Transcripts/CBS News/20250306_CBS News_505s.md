# Breaking down Rep. Al Green's censure punishment for Trump address outburst
**CBS News:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU)
*  Turning our cameras and bringing streaming video to our monitors at Capitol Hill, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=0.0s)]
*  House lawmakers voted to censure Texas Congressman Al Green, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=4.4s)]
*  days after Green was removed from those chambers after interrupting President Trump [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  during the President's joint address to Congress. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=12.64s)]
*  So here is the moment of the vote today and the response of Democrats supporting Mr. Green. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=14.64s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=20.16s)]
*  Will Representative Green present himself to the well? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=21.6s)]
*  By its adoption of House Resolution 189, the House has resolved that Representative Al Green be censured, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=33.6s)]
*  that Representative Al Green forthwith present himself in the well of the House of Representatives [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=40.6s)]
*  for the pronouncement of censure, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=45.1s)]
*  and that Representative Al Green be censured with public reading of this resolution by the Speaker. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=47.54s)]
*  Singing there and then you heard someone yell order from the floor there. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=64.54s)]
*  This also just in, President Trump responded to this censure vote. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=70.54s)]
*  Trump told Fox News Digital, quote, Green is an embarrassment to Democrats. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=73.98s)]
*  He went on to say that Green should be forced to take an IQ test. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=76.98s)]
*  Democrats reacted to the censure vote on the steps of the Capitol moments ago. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=80.98s)]
*  Here's that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=84.98s)]
*  This is not an unusual occurrence as we've seen. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=86.98s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Green famously disrupted the State of the Union under Joe Biden. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=89.98s)]
*  And Democrats allowed her speech, you know, they allowed her speech. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=94.98s)]
*  Republicans are the ones that are now issuing, issuing censure motions because they dislike what a Democrat did during the State of the Union. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=98.42s)]
*  So, you know, I think that that it's important for us to note that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=106.42s)]
*  And it's really because Republicans just they're very thin skinned and they're very sensitive and their feelings are very easily hurt. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=110.42s)]
*  And so they have to vote on censure resolution. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=120.42s)]
*  That censure vote was outrageous to my mind. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=122.42s)]
*  And what they've done is they've completely watered down the meaning of censure. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=125.86s)]
*  And, you know, if you censure people over a heckling, of course, now we'll have to start censuring Marjorie Taylor Green. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=130.86s)]
*  She repeatedly heckled President Biden, but he handled it the way that a great president handles heckling. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=137.86s)]
*  He engaged with it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=143.86s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News congressional correspondent Caitlin Huey Burns for more on this. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=145.86s)]
*  Yeah, when that happened, I thought, OK, I have seen this before. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=149.86s)]
*  Only with somebody from their own party. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=154.3s)]
*  Breakdown, first of all, what it means for our viewers who don't know what a censure is. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=157.3s)]
*  What's the weight of that? That other than a finger wagging? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=162.3s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, read, that's exactly it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=165.3s)]
*  It's essentially a very public wrist slapping. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=168.3s)]
*  You saw that the person being censured actually has to appear on the floor and hear this motion go through. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=171.3s)]
*  So it's really meant to embarrass the member. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=179.3s)]
*  It doesn't really carry any other weight beyond reputational damage, if at all. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=182.74s)]
*  So it's a very messaging kind of dynamic that they go through. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=187.74s)]
*  But you do have some Democrats that actually voted for the censure. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=192.74s)]
*  So on one hand, you just heard from some Democrats saying, look, Republicans are using this to crack down on free speech. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=197.74s)]
*  But then on the other hand, you did have some Democrats who voted in favor of censuring their colleague. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=203.74s)]
*  I mean, bigger picture here, too, is this was just one way that Democrats, at least one Democrat, wanted to express how they feel about the Trump administration [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=210.18s)]
*  and kind of speaks to the broader issue that Democrats have, which is how do they go about opposing this presidency when they have very little at their disposal. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=219.18s)]
*  They haven't really rallied around a singular strategy yet. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=229.18s)]
*  This was Al Green's way. He is also someone who has done these sorts of things before in some ways. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=232.18s)]
*  He repeatedly brings up impeachment notifications for the president as well. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=239.62s)]
*  So this is one instance, but it does raise the question of whether this will become a reoccurring one. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=244.62s)]
*  Well, the other major story in Capitol Hill today, the government funding bill lawmakers have they really have a ticking clock, right? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=249.62s)]
*  They have to get that passed to avert a government shutdown. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=257.62s)]
*  It looks like another opportunity to kick the can down the road or really seal something. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=260.62s)]
*  What are you seeing there? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=263.62s)]
*  Yeah, if it looks like we've been here before, if it feels like we've been here before, you're right. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=265.06s)]
*  We have many, many times they are considering another what we call continuing resolution, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=270.06s)]
*  which basically would just take current government funding levels, extend it through the end of September, according to this bill, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=275.06s)]
*  just essentially keeping the government running because remember next Friday the government runs out of money on the 14th. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=282.06s)]
*  So they have to get something done here. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=289.06s)]
*  The House speaker has proposed what he's calling a clean CR. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=291.5s)]
*  So essentially just saying here are the levels. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=294.5s)]
*  Let's just extend it further. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=297.5s)]
*  The president met yesterday with some of those members from the Freedom Caucus. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=299.5s)]
*  You hear about these guys a lot. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=303.5s)]
*  These are some very conservative members of the House who have opposed traditionally any sort of continuing resolution here. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=305.5s)]
*  Basically trying to make the case to them. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=313.5s)]
*  Look, guys, just get this over with, get this done. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=315.5s)]
*  And then you can have policy arguments when it comes to the actual big policy bill that they still have to work through in terms of the budget. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=318.94s)]
*  So we'll see what happens. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=326.94s)]
*  We're going to get text apparently tonight or tomorrow morning with a vote potentially as early as next week. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=328.94s)]
*  OK, so speaking to Republicans who are really pushing to get that continued resolution at the suggestion of President Donald Trump, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=335.94s)]
*  Congressman Chip Roy had this to say just moments ago. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=342.94s)]
*  Let's let our viewers hear that and then we'll talk about it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=345.94s)]
*  Well, it will be a disaster for working class families all over this country. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=348.94s)]
*  It will mean higher property taxes. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=352.94s)]
*  There are programs in the Department of Education which provide substantial amounts of help to low income and working class communities. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=354.94s)]
*  Communities where it is hard, where the tax base is very, very low. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=364.94s)]
*  Through the Department of Education, kids with disabilities and millions of them get the help that they need. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=369.94s)]
*  So I think what we need to do is take a good look at where there is bureaucracy, where there is waste, let's go after it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=377.38s)]
*  Nobody does not want to do that. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=383.38s)]
*  But just taking a chainsaw and dismantling programs which will hurt millions of millions of working class people is just not acceptable. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=385.38s)]
*  Well, we have buttons in TV, my friend, and sometimes those buttons take us to the wrong sound bite. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=394.38s)]
*  Anybody who is not living under a rock knows that that is Senator Bernie Sanders. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=399.38s)]
*  Now we have what we want to talk about. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=403.82s)]
*  Let's go ahead and roll and see what Mr. Roy had to say. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=405.82s)]
*  Just stay with us here. We're going to do this. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=407.82s)]
*  The president believes he needs a CR in order to be able to stop Democrats from playing games, which they want to do. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=409.82s)]
*  They want to stop Doge. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=415.82s)]
*  They're rattling about shutdown. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=417.82s)]
*  I don't really buy that that much. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=419.82s)]
*  But they want to be able to move forward. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=421.82s)]
*  My view on it is you're telling me as a conservative, you're going to freeze spending for six months. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=423.82s)]
*  Hold the defense hawks at bay. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=426.82s)]
*  Get everybody in a room and keep getting Doge transparency and democracy. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=428.82s)]
*  And demonstrating all the ways fraud and abuse that we can then use to go inform FY26. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=433.26s)]
*  I'm good with that. That's my view. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=437.26s)]
*  He's good with it. But what about his peers? What are your thoughts? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=439.26s)]
*  Yeah, and that's the big open question here. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=445.26s)]
*  But that really speaks to kind of the details that the president and the White House have been laying out to these members. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=447.26s)]
*  Saying, look, the kinds of cuts that you want to see in government spending, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=452.26s)]
*  let's deal with that in the bigger budget through that big reconciliation process. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=456.26s)]
*  We need to get this government funding, which is completely different. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=461.7s)]
*  Just get that out of the way and be able to move on to actually crafting the policy when it comes to the budget that you want to make. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=464.7s)]
*  So it's a it's a sell. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=473.7s)]
*  We'll see if these members take the pitch. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=475.7s)]
*  We'll also see if Democrats cross the aisle and say, look, I don't want to shut down the government. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=477.7s)]
*  Let's just get this over with. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=482.7s)]
*  You also have Democrats who say, look, this is where we can exert our leverage. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=484.7s)]
*  Maybe a shutdown of the government. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=487.7s)]
*  But we'll see if the president gets blamed for it. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=490.14s)]
*  It's not on us. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=492.14s)]
*  We'll see how that politics plays out as well. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=493.14s)]
*  We know you'll be there. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=495.14s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=496.14s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=497.14s)]
*  Whether we roll the right sound at first or not, you always help it to make sense. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=498.14s)]
*  Caitlin, you we Burns have a great day. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=501.14s)]
*  Hey, it's live TV, right? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4YwBRlemU&t=503.14s)]
