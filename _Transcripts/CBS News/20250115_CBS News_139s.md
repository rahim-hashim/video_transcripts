# L.A. officials under scrutiny over wildfire preparedness
**CBS News:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjF9aFvXnVQ)
*  Welcome back. Tens of thousands of people across Southern California remain under evacuation orders as those devastating wildfires still burn through the L.A. area. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjF9aFvXnVQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Crews are responding to four major fires in L.A. County and neighboring Ventura County. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjF9aFvXnVQ&t=10.0s)]
*  The largest of the fires have been burning for eight days straight. That's the Palisades fire, which is about one fifth contained. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjF9aFvXnVQ&t=15.0s)]
*  Also the Eaton fire you see on the right, which is about 45 percent contained. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjF9aFvXnVQ&t=22.0s)]
*  Local officials have come under some intense scrutiny for how prepared they were and were not to combat all of this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjF9aFvXnVQ&t=27.0s)]
*  The L.A. Times reports the Los Angeles Fire Department failed to deploy one thousand additional firefighters and dozens of water carrying engines to the Pacific Palisades area before the blaze there erupted. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjF9aFvXnVQ&t=34.0s)]
*  The L.A. Fire Chief and Mayor Karen Bass addressed that Wednesday. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjF9aFvXnVQ&t=46.0s)]
*  We followed the system in place. The system in place looks at the overall weather and risk. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjF9aFvXnVQ&t=50.0s)]
*  With that we pre-deployed the resources in very, very calculated ways throughout the city, also not knowing where a fire might start and might not start. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjF9aFvXnVQ&t=57.0s)]
*  As mayor of the city, doesn't the buck stop with you as far as emergency preparedness and preparing for the wind event that was forecasted? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjF9aFvXnVQ&t=68.0s)]
*  The buck always stops with me. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjF9aFvXnVQ&t=76.0s)]
*  We've reestablished our connection with correspondent Adam Yamaguchi covering the ongoing California wildfires. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjF9aFvXnVQ&t=79.0s)]
*  Adam, why didn't officials deploy everything they had ahead of these devastating blazes? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjF9aFvXnVQ&t=85.0s)]
*  Right. That report that you cited from the L.A. Times earlier, Errol, also indicated that fire officials chose not to put additional firefighters on a second shift [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjF9aFvXnVQ&t=93.0s)]
*  and that only five of the over forty or so fire engines that were available were pre-deployed. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjF9aFvXnVQ&t=105.0s)]
*  Now, officials from the fire department say that they took the right strategy, they defended their decisions, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjF9aFvXnVQ&t=112.0s)]
*  and that ultimately those additional resources would not have stopped the fires because they were so intense. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjF9aFvXnVQ&t=119.0s)]
*  But I think questions remain as to what sort of a measurable impact those resources may have had on the scope [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjF9aFvXnVQ&t=126.0s)]
*  and the scale of the devastation that we see all around us. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjF9aFvXnVQ&t=132.0s)]
*  Adam Yamaguchi, we appreciate your reporting. Thank you. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjF9aFvXnVQ&t=135.0s)]
