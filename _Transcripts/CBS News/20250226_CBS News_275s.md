# Latest news on legal rulings against Trump administration
**CBS News:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y)
*  President Trump was dealt not one, but three legal defeats in the span of just 90 minutes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=0.0s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=5.64s)]
*  These cases involve the cuts to several programs in the federal government. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  So I want to bring in CBS News political reporter and attorney Katrina Kaufman to break these [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  down for me. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=14.24s)]
*  So this is pretty stunning. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=15.24s)]
*  I did see a lot of MAGA faithful on the internet talking about impeaching these judges because [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  they're not kowtowing to what the president wants to do. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=22.64s)]
*  We're bending over backwards to accommodate the president. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=25.6s)]
*  Legally speaking, what was the rationale for these decisions? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=28.119999999999997s)]
*  I mean, three different decisions came down in that 90 minute span, as you said, and they [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  were each really a rebuke to these efforts by the Trump administration. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=37.68s)]
*  There were three separate issues here, Vlad. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=41.56s)]
*  One is that a judge had issued a temporary restraining order. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=43.76s)]
*  This is related to foreign assistance funding. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  He felt he said it was not being complied with, and he really reprimanded the Trump [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=51.84s)]
*  lawyers in this court. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=57.46s)]
*  He was trying to ask them about what was going on with this funding freeze. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=58.42s)]
*  It's been 12 days since he issued this order, and he was shocked if they couldn't give him [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=62.86s)]
*  any facts about it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=66.94s)]
*  So he has now said that they have to pay this out by midnight tonight. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=68.86s)]
*  This is hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=73.66s)]
*  And the DOJ is appealing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=75.62s)]
*  There's some news that the USAID funding recipients have until 1 p.m. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=78.46000000000001s)]
*  to respond to this, but this could all play out very quickly. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=82.38s)]
*  Another decision that was made in that 90 minute span was a judge blocked the Office [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=86.86s)]
*  of Management and Budget from freezing federal assistance. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=91.5s)]
*  This is federal grants and loans. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=94.97999999999999s)]
*  She said that the nonprofits that had brought this case just showed that it would be an [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=97.46s)]
*  economic catastrophe for them to do this. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=102.1s)]
*  She was essentially saying that they can't just pause three trillion dollars in funding [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=106.1s)]
*  overnight or expect these federal agencies in 24 hours to review all of these grants [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=111.14s)]
*  and loans for compliance. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=117.22s)]
*  It's just too high a burden. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=118.82000000000001s)]
*  So they're not saying that this is that this all they're saying is that there needs to be some [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=120.58s)]
*  type of methodology and implementation before these things can happen, right? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=125.86s)]
*  It's not saying it's not ruling as to whether or not he can or can't do these things. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=130.42000000000002s)]
*  I mean, one, I think it shows they're just happening too fast. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=134.82s)]
*  But with the preliminary injunctions, it does show that they think there's a strong likelihood [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=137.86s)]
*  that the plaintiffs could prevail. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=142.66000000000003s)]
*  So that is the case here. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=144.66000000000003s)]
*  And then the third ruling was related to blocking Trump's effort to suspend the U.S. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=146.82000000000002s)]
*  Refugee Resettlement Program. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=151.22000000000003s)]
*  That was another preliminary injunction. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=152.5s)]
*  And here they're saying that Trump does have broad discretion, but he may have exceeded [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=154.98000000000002s)]
*  his authority in this case. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=160.58s)]
*  This is a program that was implemented by Congress over 40 years ago. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=162.34s)]
*  We've let in three million refugees through this program, and he just might not have the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=166.34s)]
*  right to do this here. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=171.3s)]
*  Let me ask you about these Department of Justice rules that the president that have to do with [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=173.06s)]
*  the January 6 pardons that cover other crimes. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=178.66s)]
*  But there's also this renewed push to have details of Jack Smith's investigation released [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=181.38s)]
*  as well. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=186.82s)]
*  What do you have on that? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  So there's a multi-prong effort to get that second volume of Jack Smith's final report released. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=188.74s)]
*  And as a reminder, that's about the classified documents case. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=195.86s)]
*  It was not released because there was still a pending case against his co-defendants going on [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=199.62s)]
*  in the 11th Circuit. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=205.06s)]
*  So Judge Cannon, who had presided over the case, issued an injunction. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=206.58s)]
*  Now there's an effort to get both that injunction lifted and this report released. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=211.38000000000002s)]
*  And one argument that I think is really interesting comes from the Knight First Amendment [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=217.22000000000003s)]
*  Institute. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=221.86s)]
*  And what they're saying is that when the report became a part of the case in Judge Cannon's [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=222.82s)]
*  court, it essentially became a judicial record. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=230.66s)]
*  She had asked the Department of Justice to submit it so she could review it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=232.9s)]
*  She relied on its contents when she decided to issue that injunction. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=237.22s)]
*  And so as a judicial record, there is a presumption of a right of access to the public. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=241.22s)]
*  So essentially, it's not just up to the Department of Justice whether this gets released, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=247.38s)]
*  they're saying. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=251.38s)]
*  It's up to the court. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=252.18s)]
*  So they've entered this motion to Judge Cannon's courtroom. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=253.22s)]
*  She'll make a decision on it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=257.94s)]
*  I think we will likely see this elevate to the 11th Circuit. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=259.38s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=262.90000000000003s)]
*  But it's interesting that they're basically saying this should now be a public court [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=263.3s)]
*  document that we get to see. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=267.7s)]
*  Wow. All right. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=270.02s)]
*  To be continued, no doubt. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=270.82s)]
*  Katrina Kaufman, always great to have you here in studio. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=272.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=274.02s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFTikdlY8Y&t=274.34000000000003s)]
