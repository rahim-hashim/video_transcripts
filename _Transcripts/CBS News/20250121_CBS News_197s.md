# Fires roar in San Diego County
**CBS News:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc)
*  A new round of strong winds are prompting fire alerts for parts of Southern California. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=0.0s)]
*  About 12 million people face a red flag warning through Wednesday evening, and now new fires [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=5.84s)]
*  are forcing evacuations near San Diego. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=11.0s)]
*  Those flames have burned about 100 acres and are mostly uncontained. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is the recovery process from the devastating [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=17.52s)]
*  Palisades fire is getting underway. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=22.2s)]
*  While our firefighters work toward full containment and guard against flare-ups, we are moving [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=24.72s)]
*  full speed ahead on recovery and rebuilding because we must get people home and rebuild [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=29.82s)]
*  their neighborhoods in the most urgent way possible. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=36.86s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News correspondent Elise Preston in Los Angeles. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=40.74s)]
*  Elise, what can you tell us about the new fires near San Diego? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=43.58s)]
*  Well, those fires popped up overnight, Lindsay, and they're fueled by these high winds. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=47.58s)]
*  Some of those winds topped out at 102 miles per hour as these flames started going. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=54.76s)]
*  Now as you mentioned, there is only about 100 acres, and I say only when you talk about [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=60.28s)]
*  the devastation that we've seen so far. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=66.36s)]
*  Now there are evacuation warnings that are in place, but there is some containment with [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=69.16s)]
*  these fires, so some of those evacuation warnings have already been lifted. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=74.0s)]
*  And crews have made progress on the Palisades and Eden fires. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=79.8s)]
*  Could these new winds, though, make things more difficult? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=82.64s)]
*  Yeah, it causes great concern because like we saw when these fires popped up just about [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=85.72s)]
*  two weeks ago, they were able to carry a hotspot miles down the road and spark a new fire. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  So there is great concern for more winds to roll in. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=99.6s)]
*  I can tell you, though, these winds do feel different. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=103.94s)]
*  When they were rolling in last night, I drove around. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=107.68s)]
*  The streetlights were working. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=110.92s)]
*  You could see heavy wind, but for the most part, people were able to kind of go about [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=113.16s)]
*  their day. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  You didn't see much traffic, but not because the traffic lights were out. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=120.19999999999999s)]
*  So it did feel different. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=125.6s)]
*  You can see right behind me, the wind seems to be calm right now. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=127.86s)]
*  So hopefully we can get through this hump and there are no reignitions or new fires [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=132.2s)]
*  that pop up here in the LA area. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=137.42s)]
*  Yeah, we remember when Palisades and Eden were rearing their ugly heads and you were [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=139.12s)]
*  literally holding onto a pole so that you wouldn't get, not necessarily blown away, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=142.88s)]
*  but so that you can maintain your footing. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=147.76s)]
*  And Elise, before we let you go, we heard Los Angeles Mayor Bass say the recovery effort [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=149.56s)]
*  is starting. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=153.56s)]
*  What will that even look like? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=154.56s)]
*  Well, it's going to be a long time, Lindsay, but the first thing that we need to do here [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=156.0s)]
*  in the LA area is clean up. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=162.2s)]
*  So the mayor signed an executive order. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=164.04s)]
*  People are trying to get that toxic ash out of here. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=168.68s)]
*  It's pretty much everywhere in Eden and the Palisades areas. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=170.4s)]
*  And so it is very dangerous. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=174.72s)]
*  It's also a new danger coming because we could get rain in the LA area as early as this weekend. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=176.68s)]
*  And so that could bring landslides that could bring runoff of this toxic ash into our waterways. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=183.0s)]
*  So there is a huge concern to get a handle on the cleanup. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  Okay, Elise Preston, thank you as always. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGdNGJcnbhc&t=194.56s)]
