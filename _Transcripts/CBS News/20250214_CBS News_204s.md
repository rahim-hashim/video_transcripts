# Ukraine says Russian drone hit Chernobyl power plant's shelter; Vance to meet with Zelenskyy
**CBS News:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0)
*  The radiation containment shelter at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant was struck overnight by a Russian drone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=0.0s)]
*  That's according to Ukraine. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=6.8s)]
*  And this CCTV footage captured the moment. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=8.52s)]
*  The UN's energy watchdog says radiation levels have remained normal since that incident. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=11.56s)]
*  The Kremlin denies it was behind the attack, saying it does not target nuclear infrastructure. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=16.48s)]
*  US Vice President JD Vance, meantime, has arrived at the Munich Security Conference in Germany this morning, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=22.48s)]
*  where he is expected to meet with Ukraine's President Vladimir Zelensky. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=28.2s)]
*  This, as the Trump administration, is trying to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=32.16s)]
*  Speaking alongside NATO's Secretary General earlier, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=36.72s)]
*  the Vice President reinforced President Trump's call on European NATO partners to step up defense spending. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=39.64s)]
*  We want to make sure that NATO is actually built for the future. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  And we think a big part of that is ensuring that NATO does a little bit more burden sharing in Europe [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  so that the United States can focus on some of our challenges at each stage. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=55.08s)]
*  Now, that message was echoed by US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=58.8s)]
*  He's warning that US presence in Europe may not last forever. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer is following all of the latest for us and joins us from Munich. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=66.56s)]
*  Liz, what are you watching for out of Vice President Vance's meeting with President Zelensky today? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=72.6s)]
*  Because there appears to be a growing rift. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=78.36s)]
*  I've just lost you there. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  I think I heard the question, and that is that what's going to happen at that meeting, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=90.24s)]
*  which is the main event here in Munich. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=96.28s)]
*  I think it's anybody's guess. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=100.28s)]
*  We expect that there will be some very frank talk. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=101.92s)]
*  And the Vice President has said that if peace negotiations do go ahead, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=107.92s)]
*  and it looks very much on the cards, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=114.72000000000001s)]
*  the United States is keeping all options on the table, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=117.08000000000001s)]
*  even perhaps putting US soldiers in Ukraine in the event that Russia doesn't negotiate in good faith. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  But how exactly he's going to position himself with Volodymyr Zelensky, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=129.52s)]
*  we won't know for a few hours now. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=134.72s)]
*  That meeting is due to take place at the end of the afternoon, maybe four hours from now. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  European leaders are very much worried about the outcome. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=141.28s)]
*  In a nutshell, they're afraid that Ukraine is going to be hung out to dry, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=146.56s)]
*  that the United States and Russia will basically make a peace deal and impose it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=151.08s)]
*  And it's a deal that will leave Russia with a feeling of victory, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=158.24s)]
*  and then it becoming a threat to Europe several years down the road. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  They're also afraid, the European leaders, that they're going to have to stump up billions of dollars [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=170.2s)]
*  to replace money that the US may withdraw in support from Ukraine. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=175.28s)]
*  I think that I'll hand back to you in New York now. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=180.72s)]
*  We've lost the connection, and so I won't be able to hear your next question. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=183.72s)]
*  I hope that I'll see you in the hours to come. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  As always, Liz, we appreciate you joining us from Munich in a public square there. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=191.88s)]
*  And later this hour, we'll speak to a member of the Ukrainian parliament [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=196.12s)]
*  about Vance's meeting with Zelensky and these proposed peace talks. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTZw9D4Dfq0&t=199.64000000000001s)]
