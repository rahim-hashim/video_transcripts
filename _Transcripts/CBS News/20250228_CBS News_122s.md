# Lawmakers react to tense Trump-Zelenskyy meeting
**CBS News:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU)
*  A heated exchange there in the Oval Office just about an hour ago between President Vladimir [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=0.0s)]
*  Zelensky, President Trump, and Vice President J.D. Vance. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=4.84s)]
*  That meeting not going to plan. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=9.0s)]
*  They were there to hopefully sign a rare earth minerals deal. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=10.92s)]
*  That deal has not been signed. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=14.4s)]
*  And not too long after that explosive meeting there in the Oval Office, Vladimir Zelensky [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=16.12s)]
*  left the White House altogether. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=20.88s)]
*  I want to bring in Nancy Cordes, who is live at the White House, who watched this whole [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=23.16s)]
*  thing unfold. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=26.88s)]
*  Nancy, I want to read you a tweet by Senator Chuck Schumer. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=27.959999999999997s)]
*  He said, Trump and Vance are doing Putin's dirty work. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=30.68s)]
*  Senate Democrats will never stop fighting for freedom and democracy. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=34.16s)]
*  A lot of reaction coming out of Capitol Hill today to this explosive meeting. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  What else are you hearing? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  A lot of frustration on the part of Congressional Democrats. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  A lot of chest thumping here at the White House from various White House aides who say [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  that this was President Trump and Vice President Vance standing up for America. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=55.28s)]
*  And, you know, it's Friday night in Europe. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=62.28s)]
*  So we haven't heard that much from across the pond. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=65.96s)]
*  But one has to imagine that this is going to be crushing to a lot of European leaders [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=70.36s)]
*  who were hoping that the fact that this minerals deal was about to be signed was an indication [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=76.2s)]
*  that perhaps there was a thawing taking place in the relationship between President Trump [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  and President Zelensky. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  Now things have clearly gone south, as far south as they possibly could have with Zelensky [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=90.72s)]
*  essentially being shown the door here at the White House. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=96.96s)]
*  Nancy, real quick before we go to break, any idea where Zelensky is now? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=100.0s)]
*  Is he going to the airport? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=103.8s)]
*  He's slated to do an interview with Fox today. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  He's slated to give a speech. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=109.68s)]
*  So we're watching to see if those things continue to take place so he can at least get his side [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=110.84s)]
*  out before he heads back to Ukraine. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=115.8s)]
*  All right, Nancy Kors live for us there at the White House. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CudS5VA1OEU&t=118.08s)]
