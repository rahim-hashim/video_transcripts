# Man allegedly behind Abbey Gate Kabul airport bombing is in the U.S., officials say
**CBS News:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ)
*  First, we have breaking news. The man intelligence officials say is behind the suicide bombing in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=0.0s)]
*  2021. They killed 13 U.S. service members during that military withdrawal from Afghanistan, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  is now on U.S. soil, and is facing a judge about an hour from now in Virginia. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=10.96s)]
*  Three and a half years ago, ISIS terrorists killed 13 American service members and countless others [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=17.28s)]
*  in the Abbey Gate bombing during the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=23.84s)]
*  Not that they were withdrawing, it was the way they withdrew. Perhaps the most embarrassing [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=30.64s)]
*  moment in the history of our country. Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=36.56s)]
*  the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is right now on his way here to face the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=42.8s)]
*  swift sword of American justice. And this is a view inside that airplane carrying the man back [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=50.08s)]
*  to the United States. That is FBI Director Cash Patel, Attorney General Pam Bondi, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=58.0s)]
*  National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, and CIA Director John Ratcliffe in that picture [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=63.04s)]
*  there. So let's get to CBS News Department of Justice correspondent Scott McFarland. He is [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=69.44s)]
*  live outside that Virginia courthouse. Scott, nearly four years later, an arrest. What led up to this? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=73.6s)]
*  We expect to see this defendant, to lay eyes on a mid-afternoon here at the federal courthouse in [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=82.16s)]
*  Alexandria, Virginia, and find out what led up to this arrest, the sequence of events that were there. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  We know that the Department of Justice is going to seek felony charges, material support of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=93.36s)]
*  terrorism charges against Sherry Fula for his alleged role in the Abbey Gate attack. We also [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=98.8s)]
*  expect they'll seek to hold Sherry Fula in pretrial detention nearby to keep him in custody pending [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  future hearings in his case. In an affidavit filed with the court and unsealed at some point during or [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=110.72s)]
*  just after Trump's speech last night, the FBI alleges Sherry Fula was in charge of some form of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=116.72s)]
*  surveillance and route planning for the attack at Abbey Gate, the attack that killed 13 U.S. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=123.12s)]
*  service members and nearly 170 others in Afghanistan at the Karzai airport there. They're making the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=129.6s)]
*  argument he was a critical component of that attack. And what's more, Liz, they're also arguing he [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=135.52s)]
*  played roles in other attacks, including at a Moscow nightclub last year and at a U.S. security [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=141.6s)]
*  checkpoint and military checkpoint in Afghanistan in 2016. All of this is expected to be laid out by [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=147.6s)]
*  prosecutors as they make their case to the magistrate judge here as to why they want Sherry Fula [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=153.44s)]
*  held in detention pending trial. And Scott, we know the Justice Department filed a motion to keep [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=159.28s)]
*  this case sealed. Why is that? It was noteworthy. That motion was filed over the weekend at some [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=165.12s)]
*  point just before or just after the arrest was executed. And it should be noted the arrest was [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=172.72s)]
*  executed at Dulles International Airport just down the road. The argument they made was the case needed [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=178.16s)]
*  to be sealed to protect witnesses, to protect evidence, to protect the security of the case. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=183.6s)]
*  They then filed a motion to unseal it about 48 hours later, either during or just after President [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=188.4s)]
*  Trump's address, giving him the opportunity, deliberately or not, for a moment, a memorable [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=195.2s)]
*  moment during his address to the joint session of Congress. Scott McFarland live outside that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=200.96s)]
*  courthouse in Virginia. We're going to be following this case very closely and we'll check in again [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  with you a little bit later. Thanks so much, Scott. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWi871PBqYQ&t=210.8s)]
