# Senate to hold final vote on Kash Patel nomination for FBI director
**CBS News:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0)
*  Welcome back. Live to Capitol Hill now where the Senate holds a procedural vote to officially [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=0.0s)]
*  confirm Cash Patel as the role of FBI, for the role rather of FBI director. CBS News [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Homeland Security correspondent Nicole Skanga joins us with the latest. And Nicole, what [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=13.48s)]
*  does this vote signal to the Trump administration? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I'm gonna go Cash Patel expected to be confirmed as FBI director today, putting [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=20.48s)]
*  at the helm of the nation's most prominent law enforcement agency. And he cleared the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=27.8s)]
*  Senate Judiciary Committee last week by a 12 10 party line vote unless more than three [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=32.36s)]
*  Republican senators defy the sitting president voting against him, which seems very, very [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=37.84s)]
*  unlikely at this point. He will mark the beginning of a 10 year term today and his confirmation [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  would also mark a real departure from a decades old tradition of political independence at [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=47.96s)]
*  the agency. Dozens of career Justice Department lawyers, FBI officials who typically keep [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=52.6s)]
*  their roles from administration to administration have either resigned or been fired or ordered [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=58.6s)]
*  to leave their posts in the first month of this administration. Now, none of this is [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=63.84s)]
*  happening in a vacuum. And today's vote comes as the Justice Department's leadership has [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=68.64s)]
*  already begun ordering broad policy changes, demanding law enforcement assist in immigration [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=73.12s)]
*  throughout the Department of Justice and that direction to drop the corruption case, of [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=79.64s)]
*  course, against New York Mayor Eric Adams, New York City Mayor. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=84.24s)]
*  And Nicole, we also know Democrats held a press conference ahead of this confirmation [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  vote speaking out against Patel's confirmation. Let's take a listen to that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=93.16s)]
*  The FBI agents who work here, put their lives on the line, risk everything for our country, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=98.67999999999999s)]
*  our patriots and heroes, and they deserve better than cash to tell who promised I'm [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  quoting all FBI employees will be protected from political retaliation. He said it under [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=113.2s)]
*  oath at that very moment he was involved in directing covertly the purging of FBI employees [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=123.76s)]
*  based on political retribution. At the very moment under oath, he was denying that there [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=130.76s)]
*  would be any political retribution. And in fact, in the days that followed, top leaders [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=137.76s)]
*  were fired and a lot of employees were given word that they would be let go as well because, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  simply because, they were involved in a criminal investigation of Donald Trump to which they [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=151.8s)]
*  had been assigned. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=159.56s)]
*  OK, Nicole, having heard all that, what else did we learn from that news conference? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, this was a group of lawmakers led by Senator Dick Durbin, chairman of the Senate [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=168.76000000000002s)]
*  judiciary, appearing really right outside the FBI house in the middle of the state of [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  Florida this morning and warning in their words that the future of the FBI is really [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=178.76s)]
*  at stake here. Senators arguing that Patel has already thrown the FBI into disarray as [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=186.6s)]
*  a private citizen and really expressing fear that he's going to weaponize the law enforcement [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  agency to impact prosecutorial decisions and outcomes in favor of the president. You know, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=196.64s)]
*  the lawmakers also pointed out that when previously asked before grand jury if President Trump [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=202.72s)]
*  mishandled national security secrets by refusing to turn over classified documents, Patel pled [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=207.6s)]
*  the fifth. That's a move that might be disqualifying in the context of a different time or a different [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=213.8s)]
*  administration. You know, and leaders also pointed to big question marks around some [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=218.44s)]
*  of Patel's foreign entanglements, including his work consulting for a Chinese company. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=222.8s)]
*  And, Nicole, are there any concerns about conflict of interest due to Patel's shares [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=228.04s)]
*  of China-founded fashion company, Shien? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=233.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's an important question. Patel consulted for Shien parent company Elite Depot for nine [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=236.76s)]
*  months last year, and a financial disclosure report revealed that he was compensated with [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=242.56s)]
*  stock valued at between one million and five million, as the Wall Street Journal first [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=247.32s)]
*  reported. That's going to pay dividends when the company goes public as soon as this year [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=251.84s)]
*  and those shares become his to trade. So, you know, experts warning the likely FBI director's [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=256.96s)]
*  continuing financial stake in the foreign company could prove problematic and not just any [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=262.72s)]
*  foreign company, but a Chinese foreign company. Now, Patel has agreed to sell the shares that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=268.12s)]
*  he owns in public companies like Meta Platforms and Apple if the Senate confirms him as FBI [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=272.68s)]
*  director. But Shien, you know, isn't even the only foreign business involvement from Patel. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=278.12s)]
*  He's also done consulting work for the Embassy of Qatar and a Czech defense company. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  So a lot of unanswered questions here, Mugo. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  Okay, Nicole Skanga, thank you so much for your time today. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An_PmQAw8g0&t=290.76s)]
