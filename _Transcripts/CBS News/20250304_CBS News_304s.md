# Rep. Byron Donalds defends Trump's tariffs on U.S. allies
**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs)
*  Florida Republican Congressman Byron Donalds joins us now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=0.0s)]
*  Congressman, great to see you. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=2.92s)]
*  He is running to be the next governor of Florida. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=4.12s)]
*  He has already received President Trump's endorsement [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=6.84s)]
*  and hopes that remains an exclusive endorsement. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  We may deal with that or we may not, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=11.68s)]
*  but Congressman, good to see you. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=13.08s)]
*  It's good to be with you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=15.64s)]
*  When you think about where the nation is tonight [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=17.28s)]
*  with the beginning of tariffs against Canada [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  and Mexico and China last night, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  how long, sir, do you expect what sounds like [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  and may look like a trade war to continue? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=29.16s)]
*  Look, first and foremost comes the security [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=34.32s)]
*  of the United States, the security of the American people. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=36.56s)]
*  Fentanyl is the number one killer [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  of people between the ages of 18 and 45. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  You have to make sure that that doesn't come [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=44.68s)]
*  to the United States. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=46.16s)]
*  So President Trump has been clear. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=47.2s)]
*  He is serious about this tariff measure [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=48.540000000000006s)]
*  because he wants to make sure that China steps up, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=50.74s)]
*  that Mexico steps up, and that Canada steps up. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=53.28s)]
*  Number two is securing the southern border. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=56.040000000000006s)]
*  He's been very clear about what his intentions are. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  He's been following through from day one. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  And all that we are asking is that our neighbors [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=62.72s)]
*  to the north and south act in kind [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=65.24s)]
*  with what we are trying to do [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  so all countries can be safe and work together cohesively. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=69.28s)]
*  And Congressman, when Mexican authorities say, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=73.52s)]
*  well, you know, we hear you on Fentanyl, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=75.44s)]
*  but we have a problem coming to us from America, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=77.19999999999999s)]
*  illegal guns which are in the cartels. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=79.88s)]
*  Is that a legitimate complaint? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=82.19999999999999s)]
*  No, it's not even on the same level. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=84.88s)]
*  The reason why is you have the cartel. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=87.04s)]
*  They might actively buy illegal weapons, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=88.88000000000001s)]
*  but you're talking about Fentanyl coming into our country. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  You have kids who've taken simple medication, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=94.12s)]
*  things like a Valium or something like that, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=96.72s)]
*  dying of a Fentanyl overdose. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=98.48s)]
*  It is not the same thing. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  And so we've been calling on it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=101.68s)]
*  We've been very clear about our expectations. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  We want our neighbors to work with us to get this done. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  When they meet that expectation, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=108.08000000000001s)]
*  then we'll have another conversation. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=109.44000000000001s)]
*  But until then, Donald Trump not only promised [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=111.16000000000001s)]
*  the American people what he was gonna do, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=113.64000000000001s)]
*  but he has a responsibility and he's going to follow through [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=115.32s)]
*  to make sure he does what Joe Biden failed to do, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  which is secure the United States of America. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  And when the Canadian Prime Minister says, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  as he did today, that more meth and cocaine [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=125.28s)]
*  came into Canada in January [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=127.88s)]
*  than Fentanyl came from Canada into the United States, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=129.56s)]
*  is that a legitimate point? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=132.32s)]
*  No, I don't think it's fully legitimate [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=134.64s)]
*  because we also have an illegal immigration problem [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  coming from Canada. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=138.92s)]
*  And let's be very clear. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=140.56s)]
*  You don't have poor families or poor people [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=141.84s)]
*  in Central America, South America, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=144.16s)]
*  going all the way to Canada to come into our country. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=146.16s)]
*  So that's why I'm not listening to what Justin Trudeau says [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  or what any other leader is saying. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=152.76s)]
*  Donald Trump is the president of the United States. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=154.28s)]
*  He's gonna put our national security interests [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=156.72s)]
*  above other nations. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=159.72s)]
*  And so if they work with us, we will work with them [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=161.16s)]
*  and everything will be fine. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=163.4s)]
*  So this is really an opening measure [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=164.8s)]
*  to demonstrate how serious we are. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=166.44s)]
*  This matters to the American people. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=168.76s)]
*  It's one of the key things that occurred [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  in our election season. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=172.24s)]
*  It's why Donald Trump is president. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=173.64s)]
*  And to Mr. Trudeau and anybody else, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=175.32s)]
*  we're gonna follow through on that commitment. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=176.96s)]
*  Congressman, what do you expect the president [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=179.32s)]
*  to say about Ukraine? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=180.6s)]
*  And from your vantage point, what have the last four days [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  said about the president's approach there? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  The president's gonna be clear. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  He wants peace. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=189.12s)]
*  He was clear in the Oval. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  He was clear on the campaign trail. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=191.92s)]
*  He wants an end to the death. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=193.88s)]
*  He wants peace in that region. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=195.68s)]
*  The deal that is on the table for Vladimir Zelensky to sign [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=197.76s)]
*  is the right deal for Ukraine going forward. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  It actually helps them get the economic investment [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=203.76s)]
*  into Ukraine to rebuild after the war. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  And it also helps make the American taxpayer whole. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=208.28s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  So for Zelensky to come in and try to lecture us [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  about what's been going on in the region, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  when quite frankly, the American people are the ones [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=217.48s)]
*  that have been funding this effort for Ukraine [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  to maintain their sovereignty [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  was disrespectful and out of line. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=224.0s)]
*  So I think the president's whole view is gonna be, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  we are here for peace. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=228.28s)]
*  When Vladimir Zelensky is ready to sign the deal, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=229.68s)]
*  he has willing partners here in the United States. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=232.16s)]
*  Congressman, I mentioned you're running for governor. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=235.16s)]
*  Related to an issue that has just broken [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=237.96s)]
*  this afternoon in Florida, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  the current attorney general of Florida has announced [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  he's opened a criminal investigation [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=244.0s)]
*  against Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=245.76000000000002s)]
*  Because in Romania, where they just came to Florida from, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=248.44s)]
*  there were charges of rape, sex with minor, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=251.8s)]
*  and trafficking, human trafficking. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=253.8s)]
*  Do you support the attorney general's actions here? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=256.6s)]
*  I do. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=260.04s)]
*  I think those allegations have to be fully investigated. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=260.88s)]
*  And then we go from there. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=263.68s)]
*  The key thing is we don't tolerate the trafficking of women [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=265.92s)]
*  or frankly, the abuse of women. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=269.48s)]
*  We do not tolerate that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=272.12s)]
*  So if the attorney general finds cause under Florida law [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  to investigate that, then I wish him the best [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=276.4s)]
*  and I support whatever he's gonna do on that matter. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=279.0s)]
*  Are Andrew and Tristan Tate welcome in Florida? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=281.52s)]
*  No, quite frankly, not. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=285.04s)]
*  Because if you listen to some of the dialogue, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=287.04s)]
*  I find it to be demeaning and disgusting. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=288.48s)]
*  That's not about being an alpha male. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=290.68s)]
*  It's not about being a strong man. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=293.56s)]
*  What they stand for in my view is something totally different. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=295.16s)]
*  Florida Congressman, Republican Byron Donalds. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=298.92s)]
*  Thank you, sir. It's been a pleasure. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=300.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-Ng1azLbs&t=303.12s)]
