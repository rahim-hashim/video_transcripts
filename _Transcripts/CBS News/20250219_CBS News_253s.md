# Court hearing on future of Eric Adams corruption case ends without ruling
**CBS News:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk)
*  A hearing today to discuss a motion to dismiss the corruption charges against New York City [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=0.0s)]
*  Mayor Eric Adams ended without a ruling. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=5.28s)]
*  The mayor attended this hearing. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=8.58s)]
*  It took place in lower Manhattan amid calls that are growing here in the city and in some [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=9.88s)]
*  quarters of New York statewide that Mayor Adams be removed from office. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=14.86s)]
*  Scott McFarland joins me now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=20.0s)]
*  Rare for both of us to be playing New York City, but in fact we are. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=22.16s)]
*  I'm here, Scott. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=24.92s)]
*  And you're here because of this clash that is not just a local story. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=26.520000000000003s)]
*  It has national ramifications. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=31.44s)]
*  Justice Department ordering charges, corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  dropped. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=38.6s)]
*  Now a hearing today to evaluate that order from the Justice Department. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=39.6s)]
*  What happened? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=43.2s)]
*  What happened today over 90 minutes, the judge acknowledged is unprecedented. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=44.2s)]
*  Critics of the Trump administration would call it preposterous. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=48.32000000000001s)]
*  The Trump administration through the acting Deputy Attorney General, used to be Trump's [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=51.64s)]
*  defense lawyer, Emile Bov√©, today asked the judge to drop this profoundly important and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=56.0s)]
*  high profile criminal case against the Mayor of New York. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=61.56s)]
*  This corruption case in which the mayor was accused, completed, not guilty, to trading [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  official actions as mayor for gifts, for travel perks. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  What they argued today in court was that, and they argued this in synchronicity with [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=74.56s)]
*  that this case is distracting the mayor from doing the job of mayor, that his national [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=79.56s)]
*  security clearance has been stripped of him so he's not getting good intelligence information [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=83.8s)]
*  to keep the city safe. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=87.72s)]
*  And the Trump appointed Deputy Attorney General is arguing that this is a weaponization of [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=89.56s)]
*  government. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=94.92s)]
*  Now there's a phrase right out of the 2024 campaign that the Department of Justice launched [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=95.92s)]
*  this case during the Biden administration. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=99.68s)]
*  The Trump team alleges to weaponize the government to take out a political rival. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=101.62s)]
*  The judge heard all this and recognized, I got two different people at the defense table [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=106.78s)]
*  and prosecutor's table arguing the same thing. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=111.98s)]
*  There's nobody in this room representing the alleged victims of the crime. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=115.62s)]
*  The taxpayers of the United States and New York. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=120.1s)]
*  So he wants some time to look through this, to consider this unprecedented request and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=123.28s)]
*  what's more major, he may consider bringing in some independent special counsel to argue [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=128.34s)]
*  on behalf of the people. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  What are this judge's range of options? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=135.76s)]
*  Very limited and he said that when he began hearing. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=138.72s)]
*  The judge is named Dale Ho, a 2023 appointee of President Biden. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=141.14s)]
*  Judge Ho said that there's limited bandwidth here because when both parties want to dismiss [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=146.54s)]
*  a case, usually that's quick and easy for the court. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=150.4s)]
*  We dismiss the case. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=153.16s)]
*  But this is so different. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=154.16s)]
*  Usually when they ask to dismiss a case at the Department of Justice, it's because some [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=155.94s)]
*  of the facts have changed or become more clear. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=159.42s)]
*  A point of law has been raised. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=162.68s)]
*  This is quite different. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=164.7s)]
*  This according to critics is a political motivation for the dismissal of the case. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=166.0s)]
*  That's destabilizing for the whole system. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=170.5s)]
*  If we start dropping cases because of politics, the Department of Justice is famously independent [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=172.48s)]
*  of the White House, independent of politics. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=177.76s)]
*  That would shatter if this were dropped for political reasons. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=180.76s)]
*  I should underscore though, Emile Beauvais, the acting Deputy Attorney General, Trump's [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=184.0s)]
*  appointee at the Department of Justice in court today, denied the accusation. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=188.26s)]
*  This is political. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=192.78s)]
*  And I saw on social media today some reference from someone supporting the Trump Justice [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=193.86s)]
*  Department saying the underlying allegations against Mayor Adams talk about acts taken [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=197.62s)]
*  before he was mayor and therefore should not fall prosecutorily under acts while he was [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=202.46s)]
*  mayor. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=208.22s)]
*  Did that come up? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=209.22s)]
*  No. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=210.22s)]
*  And I think the judge was starving for that type of argument. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=211.22s)]
*  You have anything that diminishes the accusations themselves. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=213.02s)]
*  Is there something new, something revelatory about what's alleged in this charging document? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=217.26s)]
*  That's typically why I dismiss a case. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=223.1s)]
*  Much different. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=225.34s)]
*  What the Department of Justice argued today is that the government was weaponized, the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=226.34s)]
*  case should be dropped for that reason, and that the mayor is less able to not only serve [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=229.7s)]
*  as mayor but run as a candidate in the June primaries. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=234.5s)]
*  How symmetrical is this, Major? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=238.02s)]
*  The prosecutor who was once Trump's defense attorney says a candidate for high office [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=239.9s)]
*  being prosecuted is election interference. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=244.02s)]
*  The symmetry was striking today. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=246.7s)]
*  We've heard that before. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=249.86s)]
*  Scott McFarland, thank you very much. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=250.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4hbrnNURkk&t=252.86s)]
