# 4 hurt in Tel Aviv stabbing attack; Gaza residents start to return to what's left of homes
**CBS News:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I)
*  To Israel now, where four people were hurt in a stabbing attack in Tel Aviv overnight, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=0.0s)]
*  the suspect who recently reportedly had Moroccan citizenship and a U.S. green card was shot [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  dead at the scene. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=9.52s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Ramin Essencio is following the very latest from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=10.72s)]
*  Yes, and now there is concern about a security failure here in Israel, just as the ceasefire [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=15.16s)]
*  with Hamas is getting going. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=21.7s)]
*  That's because this U.S. green card holder reportedly arrived here in Israel just a few [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  days ago, flying in via Poland, and was at first stopped, then questioned by Shinbate, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=28.16s)]
*  which is likened to Israel's version of the FBI. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=33.96s)]
*  An investigation is still ongoing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=37.24s)]
*  To the bigger picture and to Gaza. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=39.24s)]
*  And the ceasefire means we're getting a fresh understanding of the scope of the destruction [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  after 15 months of IDF bombing in some places stretching to the horizon. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=45.56s)]
*  The U.N. estimates it could take more than two decades to just clear the rubble. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=51.84s)]
*  We haven't heard reports of a single new death since the IDF stopped its bombing last [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=57.92s)]
*  Sunday, but the official death toll that is still rising now more than 47,100, according [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=61.96s)]
*  to the Masroon Health Ministry. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=68.64s)]
*  And that is because the recovery of human remains has now started, with thousands believed [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=70.36s)]
*  to be under the debris. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=75.88s)]
*  But it also means most of Gaza's population, which has been displaced, is able to start [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=77.48s)]
*  going back to what is left of their homes. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=82.3s)]
*  More aid is also getting in to help alleviate the hunger there. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=85.48s)]
*  But there is more violence in the West Bank today. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=88.36s)]
*  The IDF launched several airstrikes in Jenin, which is seen as a stronghold of Palestinian [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=91.4s)]
*  resistance. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=98.16s)]
*  At least 10 Palestinians were reportedly killed and nearly 40 more injured. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=99.58s)]
*  And that comes as President Trump withdrew sanctions on Israeli settlers in the West [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=104.24s)]
*  Bank. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=109.4s)]
*  Looking ahead to this Saturday, Hamas says it will release four hostages. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=110.48s)]
*  Israel in exchange would release up to 200 Palestinian detainees and prisoners, of course, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=114.44000000000001s)]
*  if the ceasefire still holds. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=121.0s)]
*  OK, Remy, thank you very much. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVTAjCARk9I&t=122.0s)]
