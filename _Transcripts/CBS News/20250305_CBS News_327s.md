# Canadian leader threatens to cut off energy to some U.S. states over Trump's tariffs
**CBS News:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc)
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=0.0s)]
*  The head of the Canadian province of Ontario is, listen to this, threatening to cut off [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=2.04s)]
*  electricity exports to the United States. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Premier Doug Ford says he will turn off the power supply to three U.S. states, this in [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=10.5s)]
*  protest of President Trump's recently imposed tariffs. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=15.3s)]
*  Ford's government is already committed to applying a 25 percent surcharge on energy [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=18.8s)]
*  exports to New York, Michigan and Minnesota. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=23.38s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Chanel Call spoke to the Ontario premier late this afternoon [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=26.16s)]
*  and joins me now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=31.04s)]
*  Chanel, great to see you. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=32.04s)]
*  So as I understand it, Ontario largest manufacturer of car parts in Canada. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=33.72s)]
*  What impact could this 30 day delay in the tariffs on those auto parts have? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=38.72s)]
*  Well Major, great to be with you. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=45.32s)]
*  I mean, the premier has been vocal about this issue of automotive tariffs leading up to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=46.64s)]
*  this announcement today about this pause. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=52.24s)]
*  Basically he says it's going to hurt people on both sides of the border. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=54.88s)]
*  And that's because car plants here in the U.S. heavily rely on parts from Canada and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  Mexico. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=64.2s)]
*  And the way this works, explained by Olivia earlier today as well, is that these parts [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  will go back and forth several times before a car is actually made and sold here in the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=70.38000000000001s)]
*  U.S. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=76.60000000000001s)]
*  And essentially what that means is the price of these cars could skyrocket if the parts [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=77.60000000000001s)]
*  keep getting slapped with tariffs every time they cross the border. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=82.48s)]
*  So I spoke to the premier about what this one month pause means today. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=86.28s)]
*  He said leading up to this announcement from the White House, he had a phone call with [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=90.56s)]
*  Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=94.14s)]
*  He believes that phone call, at least in part, played a part that is in this one month pause. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=96.36s)]
*  Listen. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  The tone is, you know, nothing's for sure right now. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  And that's very concerning. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=107.04s)]
*  You know, as I always say, the only country that's benefiting from this squabble, if you [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  want to call it that way, that is China. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=116.2s)]
*  You know, as China is flooding markets around the world, undercutting American and Canadian [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=119.4s)]
*  workers, and they're sitting back laughing watching the two closest friends and allies [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=125.88s)]
*  fight a terror war. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=132.36s)]
*  So Major, in case you're wondering why a premier of Ontario has a seat at the bargaining [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=134.84s)]
*  table during these trade discussions, it's because Ontario is super important. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=139.24s)]
*  The premier of Ontario is sort of like a governor here in the U.S. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=145.12s)]
*  But Ontario is key because it's such a huge trade partner with the U.S. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=148.68s)]
*  It is the nation's largest economy in Canada, home to some pretty big industries, not just [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=152.76s)]
*  automotive but manufacturing and technology as well. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=157.88s)]
*  It is also super populated. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=161.48s)]
*  40% of Canadians live in Ontario. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=163.32s)]
*  So Chanel, Ontario can play a big role in this, not just conceptually but economically, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=166.72s)]
*  practically. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=171.88s)]
*  What other steps is the premier either thinking about or already set in motion? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=172.88s)]
*  Well, he's already committed to banning American companies from bidding on Ontario infrastructure [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=176.76s)]
*  projects, also removing American alcohol from store shelves. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=182.2s)]
*  We've already seen this happen today. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=185.88s)]
*  And he says he is open to cutting off electricity to three bordering American states. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=189.04s)]
*  Listen. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  As President Trump is, you know, trying to get his tax cuts and other areas, he's really [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  just creating chaos. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=211.6s)]
*  There's one person responsible for that, and that's President Trump. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=213.12s)]
*  And you know, Major, I spent a decade covering politics in Canada before moving to the U.S. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  And I have to say, this is extraordinarily spicy, what we're seeing, this rhetoric in [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=221.48s)]
*  Canadian politics. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  We saw Premier Ford the last couple of weeks wearing this hat that reads Canada not for [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  sale. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=233.0s)]
*  He's been doing that at recent news conferences. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=234.0s)]
*  And it comes on the heels of his re-election in Ontario, where a lot of people say he may [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=236.48s)]
*  have won because of this tough-on-Trump stance. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=241.16s)]
*  We also heard from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau yesterday, using really blunt and curt language. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=244.66s)]
*  He actually also addressed the president, Donald Trump, by his first name, Donald. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=251.14s)]
*  And Chanel, based on your experience covering Canadian politics, does this feel to you like [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=257.06s)]
*  maybe not a tipping point, but a sort of reassessment across Canada about its relationship with [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=261.7s)]
*  the United States, and if not the United States generally, with the Trump administration specifically? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=266.86s)]
*  The timing here is so key, because historically these two nations have been so intertwined [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=271.94s)]
*  culturally, and of course economically as well, and we are starting to see a divide. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=276.3s)]
*  I think, you know, I'm hearing anecdotally a lot of Americans do think this notion of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=281.9s)]
*  Canada becoming a 51st state may be a joke, but Canadians, many of them, are not receiving [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=285.7s)]
*  it this way. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=291.42s)]
*  A lot of people are taking this as a serious threat. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=292.42s)]
*  As a result, we're seeing a lot of nationalism sort of emerge in Canada. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=296.1s)]
*  And if you ask how, you might remember there were a lot of booze to the American national [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=300.86s)]
*  anthem at the last couple of big sports events between the two countries. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=306.34000000000003s)]
*  There are also Canadians who are now boycotting American goods. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=311.26s)]
*  And Major, there are tons of Canadians who will ordinarily come to Florida to spend the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=314.98s)]
*  winter here. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=319.36s)]
*  They are not doing that this year. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=320.36s)]
*  Great perspective and reporting. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=323.3s)]
*  Chanel Call, thanks so much. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=324.42s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VquMlfEaKc&t=325.42s)]
