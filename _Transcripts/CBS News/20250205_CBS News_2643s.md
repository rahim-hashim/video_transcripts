# World reacts to Trump's Gaza plans, FBI agents suing DOJ, more | CBS News 24/7
**CBS News:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek)
*  Hi everyone, I'm Vladimir Dutif. We are watching all the news happening in the United States [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=0.0s)]
*  and around the world. These are feeds coming into the CBS News broadcast center from all [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=5.24s)]
*  of our stations and affiliates around the country. If it's happening out there, we're [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=8.88s)]
*  going to bring it to you live right here in Studio 55. Let's begin with the shocking vision [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  for the Middle East that President Trump has laid out, including a complete U.S. takeover [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=16.64s)]
*  of the Gaza Strip. What exactly he's proposing and the reaction from the region and around [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=21.72s)]
*  the world. Plus chaos and confusion at the FBI, what we know about the new lawsuit and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=26.88s)]
*  some agents who just filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department. And remember Sharpie [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=32.68s)]
*  Gate? Think back to President Trump's first term in 2019 when someone apparently used [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=37.84s)]
*  a Sharpie to alter the course of Hurricane Dorian. Actually, I'm being facetious. They [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=42.2s)]
*  didn't alter anything. They just drew on a map. Well, one of the scientists who defended [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Trump and contradicted meteorologists in the process was just appointed lead of NOAA. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=52.56s)]
*  We're going to discuss the potential impact on the agency. This is CBS News 24 7. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  All right, we got to begin with this. The international community is reacting to President [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=62.52s)]
*  Trump's statement that the United States should take over the Gaza Strip. He made the comments [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=75.28s)]
*  during a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=79.96s)]
*  The president laid out a plan to move millions of Palestinians who live there and develop [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=84.24s)]
*  the area. Listen, the U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=90.55999999999999s)]
*  to will own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=96.91999999999999s)]
*  other weapons on the site. CBS News White House reporter Olivia Rinaldi [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=103.3s)]
*  is live from Washington. Olivia, the reaction that we're hearing from world leaders, including [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=108.72s)]
*  our allies, are not in favor of what the president is suggesting. Has the White House had any [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  reaction to what the rest of the world is saying? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  Good morning to you, Vlad. No reaction from the White House just yet on the reaction from [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=124.56s)]
*  the international community to Trump's remarks last night. But it's important to remember [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  that before he even made those remarks about the U.S. takeover of Gaza, our allies in the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=133.68s)]
*  region had already rejected the idea of relocating those more than two million Palestinians out [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=138.52s)]
*  of Gaza. I just want to read to you some of the reaction we saw from our closest allies [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=144.72s)]
*  in the region. Egypt's foreign ministry last night said that the rebuilding of Gaza stressed [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=149.32s)]
*  the need for rebuilding Gaza without moving Palestinians out of the country. Saudi Arabia, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=155.32s)]
*  one of our most important allies in that region. Also, Trump called the crown prince [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=160.48s)]
*  as his first phone call of his second administration. They released a statement last night, a very [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  strongly worded statement, that called for an independent Palestinian state and said [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  it would be a firm, steadfast, and unwavering position of that kingdom. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=174.48s)]
*  So important to note that all of our allies in that region are firmly against what Trump [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=178.92s)]
*  is proposing here. But take a listen to what Mike Walz, the national security adviser, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=183.6s)]
*  said this morning to CBS about why this is the U.S. position currently. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=188.4s)]
*  When you have two million people living on what has become miles of rubble that's completely [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=194.12s)]
*  unlivable to say we're going to rebuild with them sitting there, I think is incredible. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=200.56s)]
*  Just again, the reality of it is incredibly difficult. But back to your point on Hamas, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=206.88s)]
*  and this is where we have shared, we have a shared vision and we have shared objectives [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=211.4s)]
*  with the Israeli government. Hamas cannot stay there. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=217.12s)]
*  The argument we've been hearing from the White House that there's no way to rebuild [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=221.56s)]
*  Gaza while the Palestinian people are still there. But obviously our allies in the region [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=225.32s)]
*  say there's nowhere else for them to go and they are in favor of them staying there [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=231.84s)]
*  while that rebuilding process is ongoing. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=235.68s)]
*  So the reason why Gaza is in rubble, and let's separate the actions of the terrorist organization [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=239.3s)]
*  Hamas from the Palestinian people who are now returning to the rubble is because the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=246.02s)]
*  Israelis have leveled it in their attempt to root out Hamas. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=250.58s)]
*  So Mike Walz's statement that the people are living in these conditions and why wouldn't [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=255.10000000000002s)]
*  they want to live in better conditions, certainly that's absolutely true. But to secure that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=260.3s)]
*  part of the world, you will need boots on the ground and perhaps not Israeli boots. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=265.38s)]
*  So is the Trump administration preparing to send U.S. troops to Gaza given that, as you [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=269.94s)]
*  know, Olivia, having covered the campaign, part of his campaign statements and rallies [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=275.3s)]
*  and slogans had to do with the United States taking a step back from meddling in international [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=280.42s)]
*  affairs with the U.S. military? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=286.14s)]
*  It's an excellent point, Vlad. Trump's not ruling it out right now. Even last night he [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=289.58000000000004s)]
*  said as far as Gaza's concerned, we'll do what's necessary. If it's necessary in regards [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=294.3s)]
*  to bringing troops there, he said we'll do that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=299.12s)]
*  But as you point out, this is the most isolationist president we've had in the last several decades. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=301.74s)]
*  So for him to say something like we would meddle in those affairs and send troops over [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=307.94s)]
*  there certainly doesn't square with where he has been previously on a lot of international [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=311.82s)]
*  issues. So really important distinction to note there, but it's certainly something that [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=317.38s)]
*  would require a little bit more than just an executive order or writing of the pen to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=321.62s)]
*  send troops over there. This would require an act of Congress and authorized use of military [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=326.82s)]
*  force, something that Democrats have been calling for in Congress saying that if that's [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=331.3s)]
*  something he wants to do and to go down that route, then he needs to go over to Capitol [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=334.86s)]
*  Hill and plead his case. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=338.5s)]
*  All right. Olivia Rinaldi reporting from Washington for us this morning. Thanks, Olivia. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=340.22s)]
*  For more international reaction to the president's statements, I want to bring in CBS News contributor [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=345.18s)]
*  Robert Berger. So Robert, you just heard from Olivia some of the reaction we've received [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=349.34000000000003s)]
*  from not only our allies in the Middle East, but from others all around the world. I'm [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=356.06s)]
*  curious if the Jordanians, the Egyptians and others in the region say and have been [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=361.26s)]
*  on the record for many, many years saying that they cannot absorb an influx of Palestinian [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=367.46s)]
*  immigrants into their countries, into those nations, where are those people to go? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=372.42s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's the big question. And, you know, Jordan and Egypt really aren't [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=379.7s)]
*  in a position to take hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza, even though they [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=386.82s)]
*  do have a lot of land in the Sinai Peninsula and Jordan, their economies couldn't absorb [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=392.38s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. And then, of course, there's the danger of radicalization [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=399.94s)]
*  of that population, which could bring instability to those U.S. allies. So that is the question. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=405.7s)]
*  There really is no place for them to go. But I suppose President Trump is thinking, well, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=413.06s)]
*  let's offer them a place to go instead of rubble in Gaza that they can get an apartment [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=418.7s)]
*  somewhere. But of course, you need the cooperation of U.S. allies to do that. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=424.54s)]
*  So, Robert, I'm curious what the reaction within Israel has been. We know what the Saudis [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=428.82s)]
*  are saying, what the Egyptians are saying. We've had reaction from Turkey. We've certainly [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=433.98s)]
*  from China. And again, it just sort of makes me think about how things kick off throughout [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=439.3s)]
*  world history, right? Things that may seem to be moments that require sort of thoughtful [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=447.42s)]
*  thinking and geopolitical strategy end up being minor flicks of flame that turn into [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=453.62s)]
*  world wars. And so I'm just curious what people are saying within Israel about the possibility, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=459.66s)]
*  for example, of U.S. troops entering Gaza to somehow remove two million people from [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=464.18s)]
*  that part of the world. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=470.5s)]
*  Yeah, as far as U.S. troops, I think there hasn't been a lot of reaction to that because [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=472.02s)]
*  people in Israel don't really see that happening right away. But as far as the concept of the [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=477.90000000000003s)]
*  idea of displacing or removing these million and a half or two million Palestinians from [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=484.98s)]
*  Gaza to other countries, that's gotten some positive reaction in the Israeli government, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=492.14s)]
*  which is a right-wing government. The far right says, yeah, let's put to bed the idea [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=497.74s)]
*  of a Palestinian state and move out the Palestinians. But even more moderates in that government, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=502.94s)]
*  from Netanyahu's Likud party, think it's time to start thinking outside the box. And we've [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=509.14s)]
*  some centrist opposition members saying this idea is worth considering, at least as a starting [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=515.74s)]
*  point. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=523.74s)]
*  So then if it's not U.S. troops on the ground, then we're, I guess, essentially speculating [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=524.86s)]
*  that it would be Israeli troops that would somehow be taking part in whatever this looks [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=529.54s)]
*  like. I can't imagine what it looks like to forcibly remove two million people from [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=535.42s)]
*  a region. And so what does that mean for the very delicate treaties, treaties that exist [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=541.34s)]
*  between the Israeli government and other countries, for example, like Egypt and Saudi Arabia? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=550.0600000000001s)]
*  If the idea of a two-state solution is completely off the table, I wonder what happens then. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=556.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that is going to be a problem. As far as President Trump's law, his vision [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=562.5400000000001s)]
*  is to bring in Saudi Arabia and extend the Abraham Accords, which happened under his [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=570.74s)]
*  previous administration, peace with countries like the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=578.9399999999999s)]
*  He wants to extend that to Saudi Arabia. They've said that that won't happen without a Palestinian [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=584.74s)]
*  state being created. But it's possible that once the shock, this is sort of a shock and [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=589.9399999999999s)]
*  awe kind of a proposal. And maybe now it'll be at least a starting point for some kind [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=596.6400000000001s)]
*  of discussion and trying to find some way to reach a solution that might not include [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=603.6400000000001s)]
*  at least the traditional idea of a Palestinian state. But as we've said, that's not acceptable [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=611.22s)]
*  to the Arab world right now. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=617.3800000000001s)]
*  And so, has there been any appetite, Robert, for perhaps a different approach, one that [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=619.94s)]

*  the United States, Germany, the United States, Japan, our allies, rather than forcibly removing [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=630.62s)]
*  the Japanese from their homeland or what the United States did under the Marshall Plan [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=637.0400000000001s)]
*  was to try and rebuild those countries, try to bring about a sense of government much [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=642.1s)]
*  like our own. And they were, as you know, were wildly successful in doing that. Is there [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=648.14s)]
*  any appetite for something like that where we say, hey, let's, yes, let's rebuild Gaza. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=653.78s)]
*  Let's put hotels up if that's the plan. But let's do that with the intention of keeping [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=659.58s)]
*  the Palestinians, those who live in Gaza, there? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=664.14s)]
*  That was actually the idea under the Biden administration. Nobody talked about removing [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=668.12s)]
*  a couple of million Palestinians from their homes. And so the idea was who is going to [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=674.52s)]
*  rule Gaza after Hamas? Now, Hamas, by the way, still hasn't agreed to step down, and [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=681.8s)]
*  it's still in power, as we've seen from the recent hostage releases. Hamas is still in [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=688.48s)]
*  control. So the idea of, the Biden idea was to get an alternative government in there, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=696.16s)]
*  you know, maybe some Arab states and the Palestinian Authority. But we heard President Trump say [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=702.96s)]
*  last night that the Palestinian Authority hasn't, has failed in the West Bank, and he [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=707.36s)]
*  doesn't see a role for it in Gaza. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=712.8s)]
*  All right, Robert Berger, always great to have your insight, your analysis and your [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=715.68s)]
*  reporting, my friend. Thank you very much. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=719.52s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=721.88s)]
*  All right, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi will be sworn in today. She takes over to [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=722.88s)]
*  the Department of Justice the day after multiple federal lawsuits were filed by FBI agents [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=727.36s)]
*  and employees who investigated January 6th. They are trying to stop the public release [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=731.24s)]
*  of their names as part of a new DOJ investigation into the Capitol riot prosecutions. Let's [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=734.84s)]
*  bring in CBS News Department of Justice correspondent Scott McFarland. Scott, so I recall during [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=740.4s)]
*  Pam Bondi's confirmation hearing, she was asked very specifically about these types [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=748.28s)]
*  of situations, in other words, using politics as retribution for the work that the FBI, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=753.12s)]
*  the Federal Bureau of Investigation was conducting at the request, certainly, of the Department [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=759.32s)]
*  of Justice and the Attorney General Merrick Garland. She indicated that she, that the [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=764.0400000000001s)]
*  Department of Justice would not be used in a political fashion. So how is she considering [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=768.2s)]
*  what is happening right now at the FBI? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=774.7600000000001s)]
*  This is quite a 24 hours, Vlad. A new Attorney General is going to walk into the building [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=777.44s)]
*  today, take over the reins of the nation's law enforcement apparatus, bring in likely [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=782.0400000000001s)]
*  a whole bunch of new staff who we will see for the first time today. And she's doing [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=787.48s)]
*  it during a day in which the FBI is in turmoil. She's coming in amid a political and professional [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=791.8800000000001s)]
*  brush fire. The FBI has 5,000 or so of its agents and employees who are worried their [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=800.6s)]
*  names are on a list that is circulating inside Pam Bondi's new agency and that it is at [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=807.36s)]
*  risk of being leaked or released to the public, putting them on a target list for harassment, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=813.3199999999999s)]
*  threats and violence, including their families. That's the first day Pam Bondi is walking [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=820.68s)]
*  into. A reminder about these lawsuits that have been filed against the Department of [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=825.76s)]
*  Justice by some of their own FBI agents. They allege that the Department of Justice has [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=829.64s)]
*  required their names to be named as part of the January 6 investigation and that that [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=834.6s)]
*  list is going to be sent to the bosses at the Department of Justice for possible employment [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=839.4399999999999s)]
*  actions, possible firings or forced resignations simply for being part of that investigation. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=843.4s)]
*  They say it's a violation of their privacy, a violation of due process, but most vitriolically [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=849.4s)]
*  in their lawsuits they're arguing that they are now a target list, that people will come [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=855.04s)]
*  after them for being part of the January 6 investigations. Pam Bondi will have to get [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=859.68s)]
*  her hands around that issue and what to do next with that list and those lawsuits as [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=864.68s)]
*  she approaches the new job as the nation's attorney general. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=871.28s)]
*  Yeah, Scott, it sort of is just, I don't know, to me it's commonsensical that you would [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=874.88s)]
*  not want to release those names of those agents unless the goal was, as they are suggesting, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=879.3199999999999s)]
*  for them to be targeted, either on social media or by people who would seek to do them [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=885.8399999999999s)]
*  And also, I wonder if the attorney general, I'm sure she's considering this, what this [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=891.28s)]
*  might do to recruiting efforts, if you are going to join an organization. And let's remember, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=895.44s)]
*  Scott, as you know better than I do, these agents are not just working on this one thing. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=900.08s)]
*  These agents are involved in their careers in multiple investigations, oftentimes undercover, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=904.2s)]
*  to go after some really, really, really bad people. The idea of putting their names out [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=909.8s)]
*  there for all the public to know is something that she's going to have to grapple with in [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=913.4s)]
*  addition to what that might mean for recruiting efforts down the line. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=917.44s)]
*  This is an absolute, utter mess. In the past 72 hours or so have really broken some of the faith [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=921.52s)]
*  in this institution. It can't be repaired quickly. No matter what happens next, whether Pam Bondi [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=929.12s)]
*  decides to release publicly the names of all the FBI employees who were part of the January 6 [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=934.24s)]
*  investigations or whether Pam Bondi takes out that piece of paper, crinkles it up and throws [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=938.9599999999999s)]
*  it in a trash can and says, we're done with this type of stuff. No matter what happens next, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=943.76s)]
*  there's already been damage incurred. There's been a message sent to FBI employees nationwide, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=947.9200000000001s)]
*  according to sources speaking with CBS News, that you have to be careful what cases you [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=953.0400000000001s)]
*  investigate moving forward, that they can't displease the president or his close allies. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=957.6800000000001s)]
*  That is a chilling message that goes against the DNA of the FBI, and it's been sent already, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=963.44s)]
*  no matter what happens next. But your argument is, if you're Pam Bondi, is what good is there in [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=969.84s)]
*  releasing this list? Maybe there's a political advantage to it. Maybe there's a mandate to do it, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=976.32s)]
*  but the practical impact is potentially catastrophic for those agents and their day job, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=981.84s)]
*  which is part of terror task forces, child trafficking units, gun units, violent crime units. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=987.36s)]
*  They are distracted and potentially you could lose them from those vital missions. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=994.1600000000001s)]
*  All right, Scott, before we let you go quickly, you've got some new reporting on threats being [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=998.96s)]
*  made to members of Congress. Tell me about that. Oh, by the way, threats against the Congress and [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1002.16s)]
*  the U.S. Capitol complex have hit a new high in 2024. More than 9,000 of them have been [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1007.04s)]
*  investigated by U.S. Capitol Police, according to an investigation by CBS News and a federal [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1016.7199999999999s)]
*  report issued. That's up from 8,008 in 2023, the largest number for a single year on record for the [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1021.76s)]
*  Capitol Police, save for one year, 2021, which is a bit of a different kind of year because of the [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1028.56s)]
*  insurrection. This is three times more threat investigations than Capitol Police had just seven [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1034.72s)]
*  or eight years ago. They are trying to figure out how to deal with that fire hose, how to protect [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1040.56s)]
*  members of Congress at what is clearly a distinctively toxic and politically violent moment. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1045.44s)]
*  Boy, oh boy, the shroud of the dark side has fallen. Scott McFarland reporting for us. Thank you very [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1051.84s)]
*  much. All right, an ice storm is barreling across the U.S. It's on track to bring blustery conditions [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1056.96s)]
*  from the Ohio Valley to the northeast. More than 96 million people are under winter storm threats [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1063.44s)]
*  right now with several inches of ice and snow expected to fall. We'll bring you the very latest [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1068.32s)]
*  forecast just ahead. Meanwhile, the first group of migrants has landed at Guantanamo Bay as legal [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1072.16s)]
*  questions mount over the president's plan to deport migrants to that facility. We're going to discuss [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1076.88s)]
*  next. You're streaming CBS News 24-7. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1081.2s)]
*  Now to a CBS News exclusive. ICE is releasing some migrant detainees because facilities holding them are too full. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1086.96s)]
*  That's according to the Department of Homeland Security data obtained by CBS News. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1095.6000000000001s)]
*  The spike in arrests in the last few weeks has led to prisons and county jails reaching [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1099.44s)]
*  109 percent capacity. About 160 migrants were released on Monday. ICE did not comment on the [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1103.8400000000001s)]
*  releases but says it's planning to request more space and funding to house those migrant detainees. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1109.76s)]
*  The White House has confirmed the arrival of the first deportation flights from the U.S. at Guantanamo Bay. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1114.48s)]
*  The administration acknowledged yesterday that the first plane carrying migrants from the U.S. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1119.68s)]
*  mainland had touched down at the infamous detention facility. A plan calls for as many as 30,000 [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1123.6000000000001s)]
*  people to be sent there. CBS News Pentagon reporter Eleanor Watson joins us now to talk about it. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1128.0800000000002s)]
*  So, Ellie, you just got back from a trip to Guantanamo Bay yourself. What did you see? What are [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1133.52s)]
*  you hearing about the president's plan to hold 30,000 people there? Just explain how it would work. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1140.48s)]
*  I mean, would you be there indefinitely? Like, is it just a holding area before you get on to your [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1146.16s)]
*  next destination? What's the plan? Well, Guantanamo Bay, though it may have the physical space to hold [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1152.16s)]
*  the migrants that President Trump is proposing, it's going to take a lot of time and probably a [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1160.4s)]
*  lot of money to build the infrastructure to hold them humanely. The immigration policy is going to [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1164.4s)]
*  flight last night, contained just about 10 detainees. They were considered high threat [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1170.16s)]
*  by the U.S. government, so they're going to go into an already existing secure detention facility. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1175.0400000000002s)]
*  They'll be separate from the 15 detainees that are still held there as war on terror prisoners, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1180.64s)]
*  but these new 10 detainees will still be held in cells. Now, on the other side of the island, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1187.6000000000001s)]
*  there is a migrant—or the other side of the base, there is a migrant operations center that [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1193.3600000000001s)]
*  has held migrants in the past. But as of early last week, officials I spoke to said that that [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1197.52s)]
*  center only had the capacity for about 100 to 150 beds. Now, over the weekend, the Pentagon did [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1202.72s)]
*  send about 300 Marines to start building up tents to provide additional capacity. As of yesterday, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1209.12s)]
*  those Marines had built about tents to hold about 1,000 migrants. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1216.8s)]
*  So, logistics aside, just give me a sense of what the legal concerns are that people have raised [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1222.24s)]
*  over sending people to a place like Gitmo. I mean, I know that they're not American citizens, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1229.2s)]
*  but we do have an obligation to treat people humanely. This, to me, almost sounds like an [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1234.3200000000002s)]
*  internment camp. There are questions that Pentagon lawyers and the Department of Homeland Security [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1241.3600000000001s)]
*  lawyers are looking at, like, how long, as you raise, how long can these detainees be held there? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1248.0s)]
*  The idea is they cannot be held there indefinitely, but what is an appropriate [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1255.2s)]
*  amount of time? Other questions are how will they have access, what kind of access will they have to [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1259.52s)]
*  legal services and social services? Now, as I said, migrants have been held at Guantanamo Bay before, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1265.04s)]

*  where the immigration system would afford them certain rights. And you could argue that those [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1280.72s)]

*  people, police are searching for the person who they believe carried out a targeted shooting in [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1325.2s)]
*  a warehouse last night. One person was killed and five others were injured. The incident occurred [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1330.64s)]
*  in a facility in New Albany. That's just northeast of Columbus. Police say they have a person of [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1335.76s)]
*  interest and have recovered the firearm at the scene. In Virginia, the remains of all 67 people [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1340.72s)]
*  killed in last week's midair collision have been pulled from the Potomac River near Washington, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1346.4s)]

*  were also removed from the water. The NTSB says data shows the chopper was flying at an altitude [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1355.52s)]

*  Police say the gunman was also killed. Authorities don't believe the shooting is terrorism related [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1381.92s)]
*  and they say that the gunman acted alone. Okay, following the Trump administration's 90-day pause [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1386.88s)]
*  on foreign aid, the UN has warned that without U.S. support there could be over 1,000 maternal [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1393.2s)]

*  the Taliban police through the streets of Kabul and the difference in this city in the three and [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1414.08s)]

*  were here on almost every street corner there would have been a military checkpoint. There [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1427.76s)]
*  was also miles and miles of concrete glass walls which are now all gone and many of the Afghans [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1432.48s)]

*  Still when it comes to the rights of women that of course has been devastating for them as they see [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1446.72s)]
*  their rights eroded really year after year and of course the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1452.48s)]
*  continues to remain bleak as the economy here remains isolated from the world. Whatever the [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1460.0s)]
*  case President Trump on the eve of his inauguration made a pretty pointed statement towards the Taliban [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1466.56s)]
*  saying that he wanted to see the around seven billion dollars or so of U.S. military hardware [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1475.2s)]
*  that was left behind by the Biden administration returned back to the U.S. We spoke to the [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1482.64s)]
*  Taliban leadership and asked them if they were going to do just that. They said no chance. Back [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1489.52s)]
*  to you. MTS thank you very much. We want to bring you now back to our top story as the international [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1496.48s)]
*  community reacts to President Trump's comments that the United States should take over the Gaza [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1501.92s)]
*  Strip and rebuild it. In another move yesterday the United States has withdrawn from the United [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1505.92s)]
*  Nations Human Rights Council and has ended funding for Palestinian relief agency UNWA. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1511.2s)]
*  I want to bring in Reuters White House reporter Jeff Mason to talk about this. Jeff it's good to [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1515.76s)]
*  see you. So UNWA has been a controversial topic with the Israelis claiming that it has employed [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1520.64s)]
*  members who supported Hamas but talk about the impact that what the United States is doing. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1527.28s)]
*  What impact that could have on the agency? It has been a controversial group and President Biden, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1533.52s)]
*  President Trump's predecessor also did put a pause on funding after it was found that there [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1539.92s)]
*  were members of UNRA who were part of the October 7th attacks on Israel. So there is some bipartisan [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1546.5600000000002s)]
*  concern about the organization. But to your broader question Vlad it is an organization that [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1552.96s)]
*  provides aid to Palestinians hundreds of millions of dollars worth. So it's been a critical group in [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1557.92s)]
*  helping a population that has certainly been suffering quite a bit in these last couple years [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1566.64s)]
*  and before. But you're right to mention the controversy. It is also a group that President [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1572.0s)]
*  Trump during his first term paused funding on. So this is not an unusual step for this Republican [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1577.44s)]
*  president. So Jeff let's also talk about the action that's been taken against USAID. I think [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1582.96s)]
*  it's fascinating to me to look at the people on the internet who have absolutely no idea what [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1588.5600000000002s)]
*  they're talking about when it comes to understanding how this agency was created [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1594.32s)]
*  and what is happening at this very moment. I want you to provide some clarity for our audience. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1598.56s)]
*  Yes the agency was created by executive order under President Kennedy but Congress many many [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1604.1599999999999s)]
*  years later made it an official agency. Just explain that so people understand exactly what's [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1610.56s)]
*  going on here and what the role of Congress would be if you were to completely disband it. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1616.96s)]
*  Well that's exactly right. It is an independent agency and supported by law and if the president [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1622.64s)]
*  wants to completely shut it down or move it into state into the state department which is [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1627.68s)]
*  what his stated goal has been then he'll need Congress to help him do that by passing a law [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1632.0s)]
*  along the same lines. That is not inconsistent with another agency that he's trying to close [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1637.1200000000001s)]
*  which is the Department of Education and we're expecting an executive order on that coming up [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1641.76s)]
*  fairly soon as well but he can't just do it by fiat. He can't just do it with an order [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1646.48s)]
*  Congress has to play ball and not everyone in the Senate is going to be on board with that. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1651.44s)]
*  In general also to your broader question USAID is an aid organization that provides [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1656.72s)]
*  life-saving service funding and volunteering and aid work around the globe and there's just a big [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1662.48s)]
*  question mark now over the impact that this is going to have not to mention the impact on the [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1671.68s)]
*  workers who have been recalled or put on leave. Jeff Mason always great to have you to provide [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1676.0s)]
*  that reporting and that clarity we sorely need. We appreciate it my friend thanks. Thank you. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1681.12s)]
*  All right the former acting head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration may get [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1687.04s)]
*  his job back. President Trump has nominated Dr. Neil Jacobs to lead NOAA. During Trump's [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1692.08s)]
*  first administration Jacobs was found guilty of violating NOAA's code of ethics after he [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1696.88s)]
*  altered a hurricane forecast that was later dubbed Sharpie Gate. You'll recall he used a sharpie [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1702.96s)]
*  right? CBS News National Environmental correspondent David Schechter spoke with a former NOAA chief [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1707.68s)]
*  scientist about the fallout. Hurricane Dorian early September 2019. Sunday the Weather Service [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1714.08s)]
*  forecasted the storm to move up the Atlantic coast. President Trump tweeted that Alabama was in the [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1721.68s)]
*  storm's path but it wasn't. 20 minutes later the National Weather Service in Alabama accurately [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1728.0s)]
*  tweeted Alabama will not see any impacts from Dorian and that contradicted the president. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1734.48s)]
*  Wednesday with Hurricane Dorian still approaching Trump held up a seven day old map altered with a [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1741.2s)]
*  black marker making it look like Alabama was in the hurricane's path. The controversy became known [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1747.6s)]
*  as Sharpie Gate. That was the original chart and you see it was going to hit not only Florida but [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1754.56s)]
*  Georgia could have was going toward the gulf. By Friday without McLean's knowledge the leadership [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1762.0s)]
*  at NOAA released a statement backing Trump and criticizing the work of the weather forecasters. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1767.6s)]
*  To have a political process unplug the public's trust that got me stirred that that gave me a [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1773.84s)]
*  sense of rage. McLean demanded investigations and they concluded that the statement was driven by [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1782.32s)]
*  external political pressure through a request from the White House then acting chief of staff [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1790.0s)]
*  and violated NOAA's scientific integrity policy. McLean requested NOAA's top leaders acknowledge [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1795.84s)]
*  the investigative findings and shortly after he was relieved of his position. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1802.32s)]
*  And Craig McLean was lost that position as the acting director of science at NOAA did remain on [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1806.96s)]
*  at NOAA and was able to retire and now he is in public life. David this smacks to me of Soviet [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1814.1599999999999s)]
*  era tactics. In other words the water is clean don't believe the scientists we're telling you to [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1821.84s)]
*  drink it. So the question of course becomes what is the Trump administration said about the future [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1827.2s)]
*  of NOAA given that politics is clearly becoming a major focus of almost every institution in this [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1832.16s)]
*  country. Great line of questioning there. You know so Howard Lutnick is this gentleman who has been [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1838.3200000000002s)]
*  had hearings to be the commerce secretary or this this department sits under commerce and [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1847.1200000000001s)]
*  he has said although the project 2025 which is the roadmap for the Trump administration [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1854.0800000000002s)]
*  calls to break up NOAA he says he has no plans to break up NOAA but even looking at this story [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1860.08s)]
*  of Sharpie Gate it almost feels a little bit quaint because the impacts overall were not enormous to [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1866.3999999999999s)]
*  NOAA during the first Trump administration sort of outside of things like this but it does appear [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1872.0s)]
*  that that might have just been an opening salvo that that the intentions here are much deeper [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1878.0s)]
*  on taking on climate science and taking on NOAA but it does seem to be a little bit more [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1883.1999999999998s)]
*  but so far the word is want to keep it the same we'll just obviously have to see if that's what [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1889.92s)]
*  they follow through with. Right because as we were just discussing we've seen politics now take root [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1894.0s)]
*  in all these institutions that have protected Americans for many years the Environmental [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1899.52s)]
*  Protection Agency the Department of Education when it comes to educating our children so people may [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1903.44s)]
*  not know exactly it's it's it's easy to decipher what the EPA does or the Department of Education [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1907.8400000000001s)]
*  does explain to our viewers what NOAA is responsible for and how science plays a role in informing us [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1913.52s)]
*  the public about what's happening in our atmosphere. I mean they're responsible for basically [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1919.76s)]
*  weather science the National Weather Service they're responsible for climate science letting [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1926.8s)]
*  us know how the climate is changing documenting that making sure it's included in policy and how [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1930.8s)]
*  are we going to attack climate change so this is the central one of these central science [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1936.72s)]
*  organizations in the United States government a lot of people don't know what it is and you're [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1942.96s)]
*  right but the work that they do is critical to underpinning alerts for hurricanes like we saw [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1946.8s)]
*  in Dorian or letting us know that the ocean is getting warmer or letting us know that there are [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1953.28s)]
*  atmospheres getting warmer and this is bedrock science done by scientists who have heretofore [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1958.08s)]
*  been shielded from politics long-term scientists who are there administration after administration [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=1965.84s)]

*  but when you look at it at face value right now it doesn't look like much however when we do put [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2006.56s)]
*  on all of the winter weather alerts across the country we got a lot of people in the path of this [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2011.44s)]

*  Midwest across the Great Lakes and then into the Northeast which right here below me is an ice [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2019.52s)]

*  that's not the developing storm system this developing storm system will start to take shape [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2033.36s)]
*  as we go through the day today and this is going to be a nasty mixture of winter weather from snow [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2038.0s)]
*  to ice freezing rain and then rain to the south so there's our winter weather advisories 96 million [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2045.04s)]

*  huge impact on travel where some places could see over a half inch of that freezing rain when you [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2074.96s)]
*  get more than a half inch of freezing rain that's when you really get into trouble and the places [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2081.04s)]
*  that we're watching is really central pennsylvania into areas like eastern west virginia western [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2085.68s)]
*  maryland that's where we could see that significant ice accretion again you get a tenth to a quarter [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2090.8799999999997s)]

*  that ice difficult travel branches start coming down you start looking at more widespread power [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2099.8399999999997s)]
*  outages over a half inch that's really dangerous conditions not for heading out but also you really [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2104.72s)]
*  start to see those power lines and those tree limbs come down now north of that icing area [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2110.56s)]
*  that's where we're going to see some snow two to four maybe upwards closer to six inches of snow [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2114.96s)]
*  and upstate new york into places like vermont new hampshire and maine flad that's all over the next [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2118.88s)]

*  competing in girls or women's sports it is the latest in a series of orders impacting the trans [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2149.52s)]
*  community including an executive order banning gender-affirming care for those under 19 years [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2154.64s)]
*  old now some hospitals in several states have paused those treatments while evaluating the [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2160.24s)]
*  a group of trans and young adults and their parents have now filed a lawsuit to block that ban [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2165.6s)]
*  cbs news national correspondent lana zack is here in studio 55 good to see you my friend [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2171.2799999999997s)]
*  with you glad so let's talk about this executive order on trans care what does it say so there are [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2175.7599999999998s)]
*  two executive orders that we're talking about the first one was shortly after president trump came [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2181.52s)]
*  into office that's the one on trans care that's the one that the judge is potentially blocking [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2186.08s)]
*  trans athletes and their ability to participate in sports so the white house is telling cbs news [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2190.88s)]
*  that that's not about transgender as much as it is in their words keeping men out of women's [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2199.92s)]
*  sports but this particular executive order it says it's a policy of the united states that will not [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2205.68s)]
*  fund sponsor promote assist or support the so-called transition of a child from one sex to [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2211.7599999999998s)]
*  another and it will rigorously rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or these destructive [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2217.52s)]
*  and life-altering procedures and that's the one that's be that seven transgender people have [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2223.7599999999998s)]
*  sued so one of the things that i've started to see are people who perhaps did not vote for this [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2228.8s)]
*  administration who live in states where they're typically blue and they are thinking to themselves [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2234.4s)]
*  i'm okay because i happen to live in a state that may not suffer the repercussions of what the [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2240.16s)]
*  president is trying to do how does how does this differ from state to state so there's already [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2245.44s)]
*  differences 26 states already have bans on providing this type of care to bands are provided right so [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2251.28s)]
*  limitations 37 i believe of 39 of trans youth already live in a state that have limited [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2258.56s)]
*  access to transitioning and hormone blockers and that type of care but this would be on a national [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2266.08s)]
*  level and so that would actually change in many ways the dynamics for people in those blue states [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2272.56s)]
*  one of the things i'm curious about you may not know this but i always think about [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2277.44s)]
*  when it comes to this issue over trans athletes i understand both sides of the argument but it is a [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2281.12s)]
*  difficult it's a very nuanced one it's sometimes not spoken about with nuance in the way that we [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2286.7999999999997s)]
*  would want it to be but i also wonder how big of an issue is this and i don't mean issue in a negative [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2292.88s)]
*  way i mean how many communities are affected by somebody who's transitioned who wants to play in [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2299.28s)]
*  a sport that they based off of our politics is outsized exactly it feels like it's like everywhere [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2305.6800000000003s)]
*  but it really is not exactly and and somebody said recently that this is a solution in search [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2313.52s)]
*  of a problem because it it doesn't it's not a widespread problem now if you are a top athlete [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2320.2400000000002s)]
*  and you feel like the person you're competing against has an unfair advantage to you is going [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2326.64s)]
*  to be something that's very personal if you are the parent of a transgender child you may you want [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2330.3199999999997s)]
*  your child to feel like they can participate fully in society and in their school and in sports so [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2336.56s)]
*  for those individuals it is deeply personal but for for people who are not directly affected [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2341.7599999999998s)]
*  it is a very it is a less pervasive problem given how much we talk about it there are very few [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2348.08s)]
*  transgender athletes that would actually be affected by this but for those that are it's [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2357.52s)]
*  significant lana zach doing the important reporting for us this morning good to see you in new york too [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkvH_A9qfek&t=2363.6s)]
