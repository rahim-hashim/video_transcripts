# Watch: Sen. Mitch McConnell announces on Senate floor he's not running for reelection
**CBS News:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw)
*  I've never liked calling too much attention to today's date, February 20th, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=0.0s)]
*  but I figured my birthday would be as good a day as any to share with our [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=9.0s)]
*  colleagues a decision I made last year. During my time in the Senate, I've only [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=15.0s)]
*  really answered to two constituencies, the Republican Conference and the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=24.96s)]
*  people of Kentucky. Over the years, the first group trusted me to coordinate [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=33.92s)]
*  campaigns, to count votes, to steer committees, to take the majority, and on [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=43.2s)]
*  nine occasions to lead our conference. Serving as a Republican leader was a rare [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=54.96s)]
*  and, yes, rather specific childhood dream. And just about a year ago, I thanked to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=64.08000000000001s)]
*  my colleagues for their confidence, which allowed me to fulfill it. To the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=73.60000000000001s)]
*  distinguished members of this body, I've had the privilege to lead and I remain [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=83.2s)]
*  deeply, deeply grateful. Today, however, it's appropriate for me to speak about [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  an even deeper allegiance and even longer standing gratitude. Seven times, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  our fellow Kentuckians have sent me to the Senate. Every day in between, I've [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=105.88s)]
*  been humbled by the trust they placed in me to do their business right here. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=113.4s)]
*  Representing our Commonwealth has been the honor of a lifetime. I will not seek [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=122.68s)]
*  this honor an eighth time. My current term in the Senate will be my last. I've [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=133.64s)]
*  been a student of history my entire life. I can't remember the last time I didn't [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=145.2s)]
*  have a stack of biographies or political memoirs on my nightstand. And I know well [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=152.44s)]
*  how tempting it can be to read history with a sense of determination, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  determinism. Assuming that somehow notorious failures were inevitable. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  That crowning triumphs were predestined. And in either case, that lives and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=178.04s)]
*  careers followed orderly paths. This, of course, isn't how things work. And I've [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=186.32s)]
*  never had to look further in my own life to recognize it. I've never lost sight of [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=196.92s)]
*  the fact that without my mother's devoted care, a childhood encounter with [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=205.92s)]
*  polio could have turned out a lot worse. And unless my father had taken a job in [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=211.88s)]
*  the bluegrass state, my interest in politics might have run a course [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=221.16s)]
*  somewhere else. But if it weren't for an 11th hour outside the box idea on the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=227.96s)]
*  campaign trail, my Senate career would have been over before it began. Or that if [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=235.88s)]
*  not for the people of Kentucky, time and again, agreeing that leadership delivers [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=244.68s)]
*  an elective me to send back here, it would have been someone else from [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=253.2s)]
*  somewhere else taking that seat at the table where I've had a chance to work, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=260.24s)]
*  strategize, fight and win. I grew up reading about the greatness of Henry Clay. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=268.64s)]
*  But there were times when the prospect of etching my name into his desk in this [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=283.08s)]
*  chamber felt like more of a long shot than making it to the major leagues. I got a [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=288.88s)]
*  front row seat to the greatness of Senator John Sherman Cooper of Kentucky as a [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=297.2s)]
*  summer intern in his office. But at so many moments in my early career, the idea of [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=305.04s)]
*  following in his footsteps felt more distant than the moon. So the only appropriate [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=313.36s)]
*  thing to take away today, apart from a healthy dose of pride, is my immense [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=324.24s)]
*  gratitude for the opportunity to take part in the consequential business of the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=333.28s)]
*  Senate and the nation. Gratitude to the people I represent, Kentucky's families [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=341.04s)]
*  and farmers and miners and service members and small business owners. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=351.48s)]
*  Gratitude to loyal friends, dedicated volunteers and talented staff who helped [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=358.64000000000004s)]
*  me serve much better. Gratitude to this institution that has repaid my devotion [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=368.8s)]
*  so generously over the years and so, and to so many colleagues who have become [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=377.8s)]
*  great friends. Gratitude for my family's support and in particular, my ultimate [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=387.08000000000004s)]
*  teammate and confidant of the last 32 years. Elaine's leadership and wise [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=397.04s)]
*  counsel in their own right have made her the most seasoned cabinet official in [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=404.96000000000004s)]
*  modern history. On top of all that, her devotion to me and to Kentucky is a lot [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=411.76000000000005s)]
*  more than I deserve. When I arrived at this chamber, I wasn't coming with a [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=420.20000000000005s)]
*  governor's statewide executive experience or a house members appreciation [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=425.8s)]
*  for Washington dynamics. I knew my hometown of Louisville and I'd spent the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=432.12s)]
*  previous few years working hard to learn what mattered to folks all across the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=439.8s)]
*  Commonwealth. And yet within weeks of swearing the oath, sure enough, I was here [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=447.47999999999996s)]
*  on the floor talking with colleagues from other far-flung corners of the country [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=456.68s)]
*  discussing solutions to a farm income crisis and infrastructure challenge that [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=462.12s)]
*  affected different states in the same way. I learned quickly that delivering [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=470.28s)]
*  Kentucky meant finding the ways the Commonwealth challenges were actually [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=477.0s)]
*  tied to national debates. Seeing to it that major agriculture legislation [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=480.64s)]
*  remembered Kentucky farmers and including, particularly included when [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=491.84s)]
*  they needed extraordinary assistance like the tobacco bio. Making sure that [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=496.28s)]
*  the nationwide steps on transportation infrastructure included resources for [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=503.76s)]
*  modernizing the Brent Spence Bridge, which supports billions of dollars in [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=511.0s)]
*  economic activity in Kentucky and the surrounding region. And with the trust of [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=516.56s)]
*  local community, finishing the task first assigned by President Reagan, the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=526.28s)]
*  safe destruction of America's legacy chemical weapons at the Bluegrass Army [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=532.4s)]
*  Depot. So efforts like these have spanned the length of my Senate career. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=538.3199999999999s)]
*  And I've been humbled each and every opportunity to help Kentucky punch above [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=546.04s)]
*  its weight. Of course, the Senate has to grapple with foundational questions [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=552.0s)]
*  that reach even more broadly across American life and either further into [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=558.72s)]
*  posterity. We're trusted on behalf of the American people to participate in the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=566.48s)]
*  appointment of the federal judiciary to be the final check on the assembly of [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  power in the courts beyond the reach of representative politics and to ensure [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=583.76s)]
*  that the men and women who preside over them profess authentic devotion to the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=592.52s)]
*  rule of law above all else. When members of this body ignored, discount or [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=598.6s)]
*  pervert this fundamental duty, they do so not just at the peril of the Senate, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=606.64s)]
*  but of the whole nation. The weight of our power to advise and consent has [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=614.1600000000001s)]
*  never been lost on me. And I've been honored to perform my role in confirming [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=623.0400000000001s)]
*  judges who understand their role. On this floor, there is no place to hide from [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=628.76s)]
*  the obligations of Article One, the Senate's unique relationship with [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=638.92s)]
*  Article Three, or our role in equipping the powers of Article Two. Here, every [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=646.76s)]
*  debate over agriculture or infrastructure or education or taxes is [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=657.5600000000001s)]
*  downstream of the obligations of national security. Every question of [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=663.64s)]
*  policy here at home is contingent on our duty to provide for the common defense. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=672.12s)]
*  One of the first times I spoke at length on this floor as a freshman, I was [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=681.04s)]
*  compelled to join the debate over strengthening the deterrence of [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=686.68s)]
*  America's nuclear triad. Whether to expand the U.S. military's hard target [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=691.0s)]
*  nuclear capability was an interesting question to pose to someone whose most [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=697.84s)]
*  recent job had been running a county government. But there, of course, was the [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=703.08s)]
*  founders' brilliance at work. The hopes and dreams of every American are tied [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=710.0s)]
*  up in our ability to protect and defend the nation and its interests. Every [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=718.08s)]
*  family traveling abroad and every worker and small business owner whose livelihood [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=725.4000000000001s)]
*  depends on foreign trade, they depend in turn on the credibility of America's [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=731.96s)]
*  commitments to friends and the strength of her threats to enemies. In turn, the [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=739.04s)]
*  safety and success of the men and women who volunteered to serve this great [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=749.8s)]
*  nation in uniform depend on the work we do here to ensure that enemies think [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=754.48s)]
*  twice, twice before challenging them and those enemies never face a fair fight. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=761.04s)]
*  Thanks to Ronald Reagan's determination, the work of strengthening America's hard [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=771.92s)]
*  power was well underway when I arrived in the Senate. But since then, we've [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=775.76s)]
*  allowed that power to atrium. And today, a dangerous world threatens to outpace [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=783.3199999999999s)]
*  the work of rebuilding it. So lest any of our colleagues still doubt my [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=790.32s)]
*  intentions for the remainder of my term, I have some unfinished business to [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=797.12s)]
*  attend to. In our work, most of us in this body develop an appreciation for the [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=803.72s)]
*  Senate itself, its written rules, its collegial norms, its pace of play. And [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=811.88s)]
*  yet so often I've watched colleagues depart venting their frustration at the [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=822.28s)]
*  confines of the institution or mourning what they perceive to be decline of its [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=828.16s)]
*  norms. Regardless, regardless of the political storms that may wash over this [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=835.72s)]
*  chamber during the time I have remaining, I assure our colleagues that I will [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=843.72s)]
*  depart with great hope for the endurance, the endurance of the Senate as an [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=850.84s)]
*  institution. There are any number of reasons for pessimism, but the strength [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=858.04s)]
*  of the Senate is not one of them. This chamber is still the haven where the [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=865.48s)]
*  political minority can require debate. It's still the crucible in which jurists [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=876.48s)]
*  are tested for their fidelity to upholding the Constitution and lives and laws as they were [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=884.5999999999999s)]
*  written. The Senate is still equipped for work of great consequence. And to the [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=890.9599999999999s)]
*  disappointment of my critics, I'm still here on the job. Mr. President, Senator [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=901.52s)]
*  North Carolina. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the members and [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=914.16s)]
*  staff and spectators in the gallery be allowed to applaud for a period not to [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=918.48s)]
*  exceed 30 seconds. Is there objection? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CafM_YwwRw&t=922.48s)]
