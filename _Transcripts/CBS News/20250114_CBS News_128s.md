# Hamas reportedly accepts draft agreement for hostage release and Gaza ceasefire deal
**CBS News:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc)
*  Now we want to get you to the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=0.0s)]
*  Renewed hopes this morning that a ceasefire and hostage release deal can be secured in Gaza [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=1.52s)]
*  as negotiations continue today in Qatar. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=6.8s)]
*  Now two officials involved in these talks have told the Associated Press [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=9.6s)]
*  that Hamas has accepted a draft agreement for the plan. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=13.44s)]
*  And speaking yesterday, President Biden said a deal was close. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=16.88s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Remy Inosentio brings us more from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  And an Israeli government official who we have been asked to cite as [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=25.28s)]
*  anonymous just told CBS News the latest outlines of a deal. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=28.88s)]
*  First in phase one, Hamas would release 33 hostages that would be made up of women, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=32.4s)]
*  the elderly, the sick and some children. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=38.08s)]
*  And that would be in exchange for some higher number of Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=41.12s)]
*  Now that official told us that number depends on how many hostages are alive [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=47.84s)]
*  because they have a higher value in any exchange. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=52.56s)]
*  As for Israel's military presence in Gaza, that official said that assets, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  which we're understanding to mean military assets, would remain in Gaza. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  And the IDF would establish a security buffer zone between southern Gaza and Israel. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=65.92s)]
*  And yesterday a separate Israeli official told CBS News that the IDF [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=71.92s)]
*  would not leave until all the hostages were returned. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=75.52s)]
*  As for the people of Gaza, humanitarian aid, which is so desperately needed right now at the height [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=80.24s)]
*  of winter, will also be surged. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=86.72s)]
*  The latest number we're hearing right now is over 46 and a half thousand people [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=89.36s)]
*  who have been killed since October 7, 2023. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=94.32s)]
*  That only crossed the 46,000 mark just last week. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=97.44s)]
*  Now pushing ahead to a phase two, talks on that would start during phase one [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  and with the goal of releasing younger hostages and Israeli soldiers. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=105.52s)]
*  That official also said they are working with both U.S. administrations. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=110.72s)]
*  We're talking about the outgoing Biden White House and the incoming Trump White House [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=114.16s)]
*  for the pressure, but when asked on whether it was more because of pressure from Donald Trump, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=118.56s)]
*  that person avoided giving credit to one over the other. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=122.88s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=126.08s)]
*  All right, Remy. Thank you for that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKco_Dkqodc&t=126.64s)]
