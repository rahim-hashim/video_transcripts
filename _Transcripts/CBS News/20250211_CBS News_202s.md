# How Trump's Gaza plans could destabilize the Middle East
**CBS News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg)
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is threatening to withdraw from his country's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=0.0s)]
*  ceasefire with Hamas and resume fighting if the militant group doesn't release hostages [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=4.2s)]
*  by Saturday. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=9.28s)]
*  It follows President Trump's remarks Monday that, quote, all hell will break out, end [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=10.64s)]
*  quote, if the warning is not heeded. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=14.44s)]
*  As a response, Israel is ordering its troops to increase their presence around Gaza. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=16.72s)]
*  Natasha Hall is a senior fellow with the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=21.2s)]
*  International Intelligence. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=25.88s)]
*  She joins us now for all these developments. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=27.2s)]
*  Natasha, thank you for being here. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=29.2s)]
*  So now that the Trump administration is discussing a second and permanent relocation of the Palestinian [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=30.72s)]
*  people, give us a quick history of the situation, the complexity and why countries in the region [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=37.0s)]
*  are so against this. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=41.96s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me on this topic in particular. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=43.44s)]
*  It's very important. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=48.44s)]
*  Most of the people in Gaza have actually already been forcibly displaced from other parts of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=49.44s)]
*  what is now Israel. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  And so, I mean, they are all they are a very vulnerable community for about 20 years now. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=57.56s)]
*  They've been effectively under siege. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=62.080000000000005s)]
*  And so they know what it's like to be permanently displaced and held in limbo and in uncertainty. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  So I think that this plan goes against, I think, all U.S. policy previous to President [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=71.88s)]
*  Trump to find some kind of sustainable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  In addition to that, I think it really undermines the stability of Jordan and Egypt and Saudi [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=83.36s)]
*  Arabia and many other Arab countries in the Middle East that the United States has spent [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=89.56s)]
*  decades really supporting and protecting from radicalization, other kinds of migration, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=94.96s)]
*  et cetera, especially for Jordan. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=102.28s)]
*  This is a very resource poor country, has very little water even for its existing population, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=105.36s)]
*  let alone to take in a million more Palestinians. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  And I should remind viewers that about 60 percent of Jordan is already Palestinian. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=115.36s)]
*  And so, you know, we actually saw a resistance mounted against Israel from Jordan in decades [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  past in the 70s. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=129.34s)]
*  So it really doesn't make sense for Israeli security either to move this population over [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=131.54s)]
*  to Jordan and destabilize a neighbor that Israel has made peace with. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=139.4s)]
*  So President Trump now says Palestinians wouldn't have a right to return to Gaza after its rebuild. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  This is after saying that they would last week when he initially released this plan, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=150.32s)]
*  revealed it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=155.28s)]
*  Does he even have the right to decide? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=156.36s)]
*  I mean, that's a really great question. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean, according to international law, no, he does not have the right to decide. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=161.84s)]
*  But it seems like President Trump feels that he is potentially above international law [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=166.2s)]
*  and U.S. law for that matter as well when he is making such statements. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=172.0s)]
*  So I mean, this isn't really his area to decide, but it seems like he's pushing forward and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=177.72s)]
*  doubling down on this rhetoric anyways. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  I think the danger of that kind of rhetoric, though, is that it really gives a pass to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=187.0s)]
*  many of our adversaries that would want to do essentially the same thing in places like [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=192.08s)]
*  Ukraine and Taiwan. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=196.48s)]
*  Natasha Hall, thank you. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=198.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElT9YDElQhg&t=199.52s)]
