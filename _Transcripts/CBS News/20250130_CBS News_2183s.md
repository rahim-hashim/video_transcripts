# Officials believe there are no survivors after midair D.C. plane collision | Special Report
**CBS News:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw)
*  In New York with Adriana Diaz, we continue our coverage of the mid-air collision that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=0.0s)]
*  killed dozens of people outside Washington's Reagan National Airport. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=4.84s)]
*  An Army Black Hawk helicopter on a training mission collided with an American Airlines [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=8.76s)]
*  flight from Wichita, Kansas, just before 9 p.m. local time. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=12.4s)]
*  Our crews have been working all night at the crash site, recovering bodies and searching [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=16.6s)]
*  for survivors. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=20.72s)]
*  Nicole Skanga is at a presser that is taking place right now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=21.72s)]
*  Yeah, this presser happening imminently. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=27.28s)]
*  And earlier today, we heard from law enforcement agencies across the capital region about just [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=30.76s)]
*  how expansive this search and rescue mission has been with over 300 personnel on the ground [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=36.82s)]
*  and in the water. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=43.58s)]
*  Of course, the big question remaining, are there any survivors? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=44.92s)]
*  How many bodies have been recovered? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  A law enforcement source telling CBS News that at least 30 individuals, 30 bodies have [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=51.4s)]
*  been recovered from the icy Potomac, waiting on official confirmation here from authorities [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=57.36s)]
*  just regarding how much debris, how many individuals they were able to actually pull from the water [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=63.42s)]
*  here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=70.68s)]
*  And authorities could also tell us a little bit more about when we will switch from this [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=71.98s)]
*  being a search and recovery mission to specifically more of a salvage mission. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=77.12s)]
*  We know that investigators are also on the ground with the NTSB, the National Transportation [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=82.64s)]
*  Safety Board. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=88.26s)]
*  They are the lead on this investigation. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=89.44000000000001s)]
*  We are waiting to hear what they were able to recover on the scene, what they'll be looking [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=92.04s)]
*  for. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=97.04s)]
*  Of course, we know that investigators right now are very focused on why this Army Blackhawk [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=98.04s)]
*  helicopter was flying at such a low altitude near the airport. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=103.24s)]
*  Everyone asking that question today. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=109.19999999999999s)]
*  Beyond that, of course, we know that there were 60 passengers and four crew members aboard [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=112.0s)]
*  the plane in addition to three Army soldiers in that Blackhawk. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=116.88s)]
*  But we know few details regarding who was on that flight, so hoping that authorities [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=121.32s)]
*  might also share a little bit more with us about some of those victims there. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=127.24s)]
*  Still so many questions, Nicole. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=133.92s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=134.92s)]
*  Stand by a second. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=135.92s)]
*  Let us know when that press conference start. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=136.92s)]
*  But for now, let's go to our senior transportation correspondent, Chris Van Cleave. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=138.16s)]
*  Chris? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=142.96s)]
*  Hey, Geronda, you know, those helicopters are supposed to fly at 200 feet or less when they [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  approach the arrival pattern or the departure pattern for Washington, Reagan Airport. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=149.92s)]
*  We were up in the DC police helicopter just a couple of weeks ago ahead of the inauguration. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=155.76s)]
*  And when we approached the area that was under Reagan tower control, we very quickly descended [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=159.84s)]
*  from about 850 feet down below 200 feet for that very reason to be out of the way of the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=166.44s)]
*  commercial airline traffic that was operating. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=173.04s)]
*  So one of the things that investigators are going to want to try to understand here is [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=175.76s)]
*  if the preliminary flight data is correct, why the helicopter appears to perhaps have [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  been above that 200 foot, what I would call a hard deck, if you will, for those helicopters. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=185.64s)]
*  Obviously, a priority is going to be getting the black boxes, the cockpit voice recorder, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=192.76s)]
*  the cockpit data recorder. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=198.88s)]
*  There was some reports last night that a team thought they may have found at least one of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=201.0s)]
*  them. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  So that may be an update we get today from the NTSB. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  Back inside to you, Adriana. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=208.67999999999998s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=210.72s)]
*  And we are now looking at this press conference that's about to begin. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=211.72s)]
*  Mayor Muriel Bowser is at the podium. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=214.6s)]
*  Let's listen in. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=216.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=233.36s)]
*  Muriel Bowser is standing there at the podium about to begin. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=234.36s)]
*  She is standing with leaders in Washington, D.C. including the DMS and Fire Chief. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=236.16s)]
*  I'm Muriel Bowser. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=240.36s)]
*  I'm the mayor of Washington, D.C. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=241.72s)]
*  We are here at Reagan National Airport to provide an update on the tragic events of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  last night. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm joined by U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, D.C. Fire and EMF Chief John [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  Donnelly, American Airlines CEO Robert Eisen, the M.Y. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=260.12s)]
*  The Washington Metropolitan Washington Air Force Authority CEO Jack Carter, United States [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=266.12s)]
*  Senator Mark Warner, United States Senator Tim Kaine, U.S. Representative Don Beyer, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=272.56s)]
*  as well as the Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department Pamela Smith. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=279.08s)]
*  And we are joined by first responders from across the Metropolitan Washington region. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=284.0s)]
*  I speak for all of us when I say and certainly all Washingtonians how very sad we are for [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=290.24s)]
*  Airlines, for the United States Department of Defense, and for all Americans for the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=300.4s)]
*  loss of life that happened with the collision of these aircrafts. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  We know that includes families from across our region as well as in Kansas and across [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=312.92s)]
*  the country. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=319.2s)]
*  This morning we all share in a profound sense of grief. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=320.84s)]
*  I do want to thank the first responders who acted quickly last night, who ran towards [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=324.8s)]
*  danger, went into a very frigid river, and have worked throughout the night. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=330.6s)]
*  Chief Donnelly reported in last night's briefing that we have a strong mutual aid agreement [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=338.04s)]
*  in our region and those teams have worked together throughout the night in really tough [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=344.04s)]
*  and heartbreaking conditions. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=349.48s)]
*  We should all thank them for their heroic efforts. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=351.8s)]
*  So we'll have several updates today. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=354.76s)]
*  I'm first going to turn to the Secretary of Transportation, Sean Duffy, and then you [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=356.92s)]
*  will hear directly from Chief John Donnelly with a situational update. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=364.32s)]
*  Thank you, Mayor. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=369.96s)]
*  Again Sean Duffy here, Secretary of Transportation. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=373.24s)]
*  We wish we were gathering for different purposes today. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=376.76s)]
*  I just want to let you know that the Department of Transportation, the FAA, along with the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=381.24s)]
*  White House President Trump, local, state, and federal partners all working together [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=386.64s)]
*  on this incident in unison. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=394.12s)]
*  I couldn't be prouder of this team that's been assembled working tirelessly. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=396.12s)]
*  Mayor, I want to thank you specifically for your work. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=399.71999999999997s)]
*  A few details I'd like to give all of you and some of you reported this, but last night [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=402.76s)]
*  if you live in the D.C. area you would know that this was a clear night last night. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=408.64s)]
*  The helicopter was in a standard pattern. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=415.48s)]
*  If you live in the D.C. area you'll see helicopters up and down the river. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=418.48s)]
*  This flight pattern is seen oftentimes when you live in D.C. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=422.12s)]
*  This was a standard flight pattern last night as well. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  The American airline flight coming into land was in a standard flight pattern as it was [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=428.84s)]
*  coming into D.C.A. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=434.67999999999995s)]
*  So this was not unusual with military aircraft flying the river and aircraft landing at D.C.A. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=436.88s)]
*  And again if you live in the area you'll see that frequently with those two aircraft working [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=444.96s)]
*  together. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=453.96s)]
*  As many of you reported we have located the two aircrafts. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=458.84000000000003s)]
*  The fuselage of the American airline plane was inverted. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=465.16s)]
*  It's been located in three different sections. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=470.6s)]
*  It's in about waist deep water. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=474.68s)]
*  So that recovery is going to go on today as that recovery takes place of the fuselage [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=477.08000000000004s)]
*  of the aircraft. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=482.76s)]
*  NTSB is going to start to analyze that aircraft, partner with the FAA with all the information [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=484.4s)]
*  we have to get the best results possible for the American people. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=490.71999999999997s)]
*  I would just say that safety is our expectation. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=495.28s)]
*  Everyone who flies in American skies expects that we fly safely. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=500.44s)]
*  That when you depart an airport you get to your destination. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=505.48s)]
*  That didn't happen last night. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=510.8s)]
*  And I know that President Trump, his administration, the FAA, the DOT, we will not rest until [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=512.72s)]
*  we have answers for the families and for the flying public. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=518.8000000000001s)]
*  You should be assured that when you fly you're safe. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=523.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=527.28s)]
*  Thank you Secretary. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=536.28s)]
*  Thank you Mayor. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=537.28s)]
*  I'm here today with Fire Chief Bonnet from the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=538.36s)]
*  And I'm John Donnelly, Chief of the District of Columbia Fire and AMS Department. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=544.3199999999999s)]
*  Last night at 848 the control tower sounded an alert which alerts responders to respond [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=549.24s)]
*  to a report of an aircraft crash on or near the airport. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=556.24s)]
*  That sets off an immediate response from the airport authority fire department, from the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=560.24s)]
*  District of Columbia and Metropolitan Harbor Patrol fire boats and other fire boats on [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=565.5200000000001s)]

*  In a most partisan place, also, it's, I'm really thankful that Democrats and Republicans, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1192.24s)]
*  people from all over have come together to try to make sure that people are served. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1197.6s)]
*  As a local representative, I want the families to know that our office is available to serve [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1202.8s)]
*  you in any way we possibly can through this time of grief and transition and loss. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1208.52s)]
*  And then also just note that we're deeply grateful for the people who risked their lives [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1214.4399999999998s)]
*  last night on a moment's notice, the whole night on the river and the ice and the wind [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1221.16s)]
*  serving us. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1226.44s)]
*  And then finally, as Senator Kaine noted, after the NTSB investigation, we've got to [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1227.92s)]
*  make sure that at the federal level and with the support of Virginia, Maryland, D.C., we're [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1235.6000000000001s)]
*  doing everything we can to make sure this does not happen again. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1240.5600000000002s)]
*  So, with that, it's been said already that the National Transportation Safety Board [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1251.5200000000002s)]
*  becomes the lead agency in the investigation. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1258.2800000000002s)]
*  Our jurisdiction in D.C., where the crash occurred over the river, is, concludes as [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1263.5600000000002s)]
*  we, in the leadership role of the Unified Command, as we shift to a recovery effort. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1272.68s)]
*  We expect the National Transportation Safety Board to provide briefings to the press later [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1279.8s)]
*  in the day. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1286.3799999999999s)]
*  So, at this point, we can take a few questions. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1287.3799999999999s)]
*  Yes? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1291.2s)]
*  What we're talking, what we can talk about today is what happened here with the collision [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1292.2s)]
*  of these vehicles. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1303.6399999999999s)]
*  We said what we know and that the National Transportation Safety Board continues to investigate. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1305.9199999999998s)]
*  I don't know that any of us have been briefed on anything that would suggest any other aircraft [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1312.6s)]
*  are implicated. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1318.9599999999998s)]
*  Yes? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1319.9599999999998s)]
*  Chief? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1320.9599999999998s)]
*  So, the rescue operation, or the recovery operation goes on. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1321.9599999999998s)]
*  It's a lot of touch and feel in the different parts of the plane or in the helicopter, and [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1332.6s)]
*  the crash area is a little spread out, so we've got some work to do. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1336.8s)]
*  And I think it's a pretty normal type of situation. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1342.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't think it's extraordinary. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1344.8s)]
*  How spread out is this debris field? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1345.8s)]
*  So the wind started blowing last night, so we've had debris travel from the airport down [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1348.9199999999998s)]
*  as far as the Wilson Bridge. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1353.1399999999999s)]
*  Mile-wise, how far is that? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1354.36s)]
*  I couldn't tell you. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1357.36s)]
*  Less than a mile. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1358.36s)]
*  This is a question for the CEO partner. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1360.12s)]
*  You're going to open the airport at 11 o'clock this morning. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1365.12s)]
*  How are you going to do that? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1368.12s)]
*  And what impact does that have on operations, on passengers, on people's anxiety? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1370.12s)]
*  How are we going to do that? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1377.12s)]
*  Well, we're going to open the airport at 11 o'clock. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1379.12s)]
*  It's safe. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1382.12s)]
*  We've worked with all the federal agencies, FAA, and it's been determined that we can [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1383.12s)]
*  open that airport safely. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1388.9s)]
*  The recovery effort that's on our property is on the waterfront. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1391.1200000000001s)]
*  Our primary runway, 119, will be open. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1395.92s)]
*  It's away from any activity. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1400.16s)]
*  We're going to have a secure area around that, so all are comfortable that we can get back [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1402.16s)]
*  to operations. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1408.16s)]
*  Now, each airline will announce or communicate to their passengers what their operations [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1409.16s)]
*  are going to be. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1418.08s)]
*  Obviously, their networks were disrupted overnight, and so we might have a slow recovery, but [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1419.08s)]
*  the bottom line is we will begin to have aircraft moving out of this airport at 11 o'clock. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1423.6399999999999s)]
*  Okay, so one, two, three. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1429.6399999999999s)]
*  So I'll play the quarter-day report. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1432.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't think we can say anything about what's in TSB's purview. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1437.6399999999999s)]
*  You mentioned the airport opens three hours from now. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1442.6399999999999s)]
*  Will helicopters be flying right through here as well beyond the recovery efforts? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1445.64s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that, Jack. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1452.64s)]
*  Do you have anything to add? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1455.64s)]
*  We don't have anything to add about that. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1456.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1458.64s)]
*  First, I'm curious if the United States has the most safe and secure airspace in the world [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1459.64s)]
*  and the answer to that is absolutely, yes, we do. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1475.64s)]
*  We have early indicators of what happened here, and I will tell you with complete confidence [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1478.64s)]
*  we have the safest airspace in the world. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1484.64s)]
*  Okay, what's next? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1487.64s)]
*  When it comes to the airport, the [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1489.64s)]
*  flight manifesto, is there anything you can add? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1498.8600000000001s)]
*  Can you add anything? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1502.64s)]
*  All I can say is that we have published the 1-800 number. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1504.64s)]
*  We have family assistance centers set up here in DCA. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1512.64s)]
*  We do in Wichita as well. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1517.64s)]
*  I'm not at liberty to give the number of families that have used those services, but we are [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1520.64s)]
*  making that use. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1529.64s)]
*  We have over 100 team members that are either here or on their way that are specially trained [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1531.3600000000001s)]
*  to work with family members, handle travel arrangements, hotel arrangements, incidentals, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1538.04s)]
*  to make sure that we're taking care of people in any way that they can. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1544.04s)]
*  As our teams are hurting and suffering, as our passengers and their families need assistance, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1548.04s)]
*  we're doing everything we can. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1555.04s)]
*  I don't have any other more information on that right now. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1556.04s)]
*  Go next. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1559.24s)]
*  Chief Donnelly, can I ask you to describe the next phase of the investigation? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1560.24s)]
*  How confident are you that you'll be able to recover all 67 of these bodies? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1564.24s)]
*  And can you speak to some of the debris that's also being pulled out of the river? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1569.24s)]
*  We understand there are some cases, some other things that have been pulled out from the river. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1574.24s)]
*  And I would like to ask anyone here, perhaps the Transportation Secretary or Mr. Eisen, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1580.24s)]
*  how do you know anything about these victims, age ranges, nationalities, and the death of [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1586.44s)]
*  victims? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1590.44s)]
*  So the next phase of this operation is going to be led by the NTSB. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1591.44s)]
*  All of us are working together though to search the area and find the victims. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1596.44s)]
*  I'm confident that we will do that. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1602.44s)]
*  And that will take us a little bit of time though. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1605.44s)]
*  It may involve some more equipment. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1608.44s)]
*  As far as the things being collected, I don't have personal knowledge. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1610.04s)]
*  I know that we have been collecting debris that you would expect to see from a plane. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1612.84s)]
*  Anything about the victims? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1616.84s)]
*  So the question is about the victims. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1619.84s)]
*  The NTSB is going to lead that portion of the contact with the victims. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1622.84s)]
*  I believe American is going to be involved with that as well. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1628.84s)]
*  And so will the FAA and the Department of Transportation. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1631.84s)]
*  Secretary Duffy, we're going to take some questions over here. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1634.84s)]
*  One, two, three, four. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1637.84s)]
*  For Secretary Duffy, the flight path that the helicopter was on, is that a common flight path? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1642.84s)]
*  And is it normal for helicopters to get clearance to cut across busy workspouts? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1648.84s)]
*  So I don't know if you all could hear the question. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1653.84s)]
*  It's a question about the flight path of the helicopter. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1657.84s)]
*  I don't want to go into too much detail about the information we have from the FAA. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1660.84s)]
*  But obviously, it is not standard to have aircraft collide. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1665.84s)]
*  I want to be clear on that. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1671.84s)]
*  But prior to the collision, the flight paths that were being flown from the military and from American, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1673.84s)]
*  that was not unusual for what happens in the D.C. airspace. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1681.84s)]
*  And as this investigation moves forward, we will be able to provide more information to you about the details of that statement. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1685.84s)]
*  So the question is, were there blind spots with air traffic control? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1706.84s)]
*  I don't want to make statements about that. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1710.84s)]
*  I don't need that answer. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1713.84s)]
*  But again, I think whether it was air traffic control, whether it was military aircraft, helicopters, or the American flight, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1715.84s)]
*  everything was standard in the lead-up to the crash. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1726.84s)]
*  Now, obviously, something happened here. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1732.84s)]
*  You'll get more information and more details as this investigation moves forward. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1734.84s)]
*  We'll learn what happened. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1738.84s)]
*  But again, those who live in the D.C. area, we see military helicopters fly up and down the river. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1741.84s)]
*  It's a standard path that they fly. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1747.84s)]
*  They're used to aircraft landing at D.C.A. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1749.84s)]
*  And there's a procedure in place because this happens every day. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1753.84s)]
*  Something went wrong here. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1757.84s)]
*  I look forward to the time and point when we can give you that information. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1759.84s)]
*  But I don't want to comment on that right now. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1763.84s)]
*  We have raised this issue continuously. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1770.84s)]
*  We've got very busy airspace. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1782.84s)]
*  I think we will ask questions, but at the appropriate time. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1785.84s)]
*  We are in this period right now where families are still being notified. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1789.84s)]
*  We're trying to figure out what happened. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1793.84s)]
*  There'll be time for those discussions. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1795.84s)]
*  Yeah, I'd just say the same thing. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1797.84s)]
*  I think we've been pretty plain about our concerns, but it isn't a good time to speculate right now. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1798.84s)]
*  We have faith that the NTSB will provide the answers about this. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1803.84s)]
*  So, thank you for the question. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1807.84s)]
*  Our first responders are resilient people, but yes, this call will be hard for them. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1828.84s)]
*  Our peer support teams are already engaged with the responders, and we'll be following up on that to make sure that they're okay. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1833.84s)]
*  But I think the concern is real. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1840.84s)]
*  I don't want to say too much on the communication between the helicopter in the tower and the airline in the tower. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1854.84s)]
*  But I will say this. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1861.84s)]
*  There was communication. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1863.84s)]
*  It was standard communication. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1865.84s)]
*  So there was not a breakdown, if that's your question, in communication between the military helicopter and the American airline flight. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1871.84s)]
*  There was communication between the aircraft and the tower. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1879.84s)]
*  I would say the helicopter was aware that there was a plane in the area. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1882.84s)]
*  In terms of body recovery, as we recover bodies, we have a process, and we're not counting anybody until they're in the possession of the medical director. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1912.84s)]
*  So there may be some fluctuating in numbers that other people would report, but our numbers from the medical examiner. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1932.84s)]
*  So in regard to the president in the briefing room, I've been with this team for the last hour plus as we've worked through the details of the information we wanted to give you. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1940.84s)]
*  But it is my understanding that either this morning he was going to be in the situation room or the situation room is obviously briefing the president. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1951.84s)]
*  He has been kept in full appraisal of what is taking place. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1959.84s)]
*  Okay, last two. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1965.84s)]
*  You mentioned that the aircraft were on a standard flight pattern. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1968.84s)]
*  What experience has the airport opened that 11 days will place beyond that flight pattern? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1972.84s)]
*  Are they being directed to a different place? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1979.84s)]
*  Jack, do you want to answer that? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1984.84s)]
*  Well, safety is paramount. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1987.84s)]
*  And I don't have that information quite yet from the FAA, so I don't want to provide an information or I don't want to provide an answer or inaccurate information on what routes will be flown out of DCA. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=1992.84s)]
*  Two questions really quickly. What do you know about the experience and history of the pilots of those American Airlines planes and the Army helicopter? [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=2006.84s)]
*  And then for Secretary Duffy, last night the president had said that this could have been prevented and questioned why air traffic control didn't tell the helicopter what to do. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=2015.84s)]
*  Is that something that investigators have determined should have happened? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=2024.84s)]
*  Secretary, just quickly, I don't have a lot of information to release, but these are experienced pilots. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=2029.84s)]
*  I know that the captain had six years with PSA or almost six years with PSA and the first officer almost two years. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=2038.84s)]
*  And again, standard approach. And that's about all I can say. Thank you. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=2046.84s)]
*  In regard to the military, I don't have information in regard to the experience of the military pilots. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=2055.84s)]
*  I would just note that this was classified as a training mission. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=2061.84s)]
*  Sometimes people could think that a training mission is someone who is inexperienced in the cockpit. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=2065.84s)]
*  This is we call these these missions that are flown in the DCA area as our pilots are getting hours and experience training missions. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=2072.84s)]
*  So don't read into that that we had how many hours the pilots on the military aircraft had. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=2079.84s)]
*  And you had another question for me that was. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=2086.84s)]
*  Yep. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=2089.84s)]
*  So we are going to wait for all the information to come in from from this vantage point. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=2097.84s)]
*  To to back up what the president said, what I've seen so far, do I think this was preventable? Absolutely. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=2102.84s)]
*  All right. You just heard in a news conference that the search for the victims of that deadly midair collision has now turned from a rescue operation to a recovery operation. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=2120.84s)]
*  The DC Fire and EMS chief says he does not believe there are any survivors. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=2130.84s)]
*  According to what we just heard, he said twenty seven bodies have been recovered from people who were on the plane and one body from someone on the helicopter. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=2134.84s)]
*  And you know that news just has to be absolutely devastating for those families who have been waiting for information about their loved ones. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=2143.84s)]
*  And in fact, American Airlines has given out this number. It is one eight hundred six seven nine eight two one five again one eight hundred six seven nine eight two one five. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=2149.84s)]
*  If you believe you had a loved one on board that flight, please give that number a call. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=2159.84s)]
*  Our coverage of this disaster will continue on CBS Mornings, your local news and our streaming channel, CBS News 24 seven. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=2165.84s)]
*  Many of you now will return to CBS Mornings. This has been a CBS News special report. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zLYjNv4Lw&t=2172.84s)]
