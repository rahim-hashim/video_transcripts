# Fed expected to leave interest rates unchanged in first rate decision of 2nd Trump presidency
**CBS News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM)
*  The Federal Reserve will make its first interest rate decision under the new Trump administration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=0.0s)]
*  this afternoon. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Economists predict the Fed will hold rates steady, keeping the benchmark rate at four [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=6.76s)]
*  and one quarter to four and a half percent. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=11.52s)]
*  This comes on the heels of three consecutive rate cuts. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=14.88s)]
*  For more on today's Fed meeting, let's bring in CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=17.64s)]
*  who knows it all, I like to say. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=22.16s)]
*  Jill, but how much do you really know about what today's Fed decision will actually be, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=24.439999999999998s)]
*  or what's behind it at least? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=30.28s)]
*  Well, I think we know a lot because a lot of the Fed Reserve officials themselves have [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=32.4s)]
*  been out telegraphing what they are thinking. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  And it is just this. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=41.44s)]
*  Look, the Fed has two jobs, right? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=42.72s)]
*  They want to push down the inflation rate closer to their target of around two percent. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=45.34s)]
*  We're now running it about, you know, close to three percent. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  And they also want to make sure that interest rates don't stay too high for so long that [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=52.5s)]
*  it starts to eat into the economy and cause labor losses. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=57.46s)]
*  So what I think the Fed is really telling us is they are still a ways away from reaching [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=62.54s)]
*  that target of two percent inflation, and the economy is doing just fine right now with [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=68.5s)]
*  these higher interest rates. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=74.22s)]
*  So as a result, they have told us time and time again they're data-dependent until they [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=76.2s)]
*  see more evidence that inflation is moving lower and maybe evidence that the economy [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=81.48s)]
*  is doing just fine. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  They don't have to do anything. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  So a pause in their rate cut campaign is what is widely expected. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=89.74000000000001s)]
*  We just looked at a graph showing that inflation hit its lowest rate around September of last [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=95.36s)]
*  year. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=99.92s)]
*  It's slowly inching its way back up, which speaks to just how delicate things are. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=100.92s)]
*  I'm wondering how Trump's new policies may impact the Fed's decision, especially when [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=106.4s)]
*  you look at things like tariffs that he's threatening. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=110.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the tariffs are really going to be critical. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=112.92s)]
*  We don't know what these tariffs are right now. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=118.36s)]
*  We have broad announcements of what the intentions could be, but until we get specifics, it's [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  hard to judge how that could impact the economy. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=126.92s)]
*  Here's what we know. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=129.36s)]
*  When a tariff is slapped on an imported good, who pays for that? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=131.0s)]
*  Will the importing U.S. company? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=135.72s)]
*  And if that company were to pass along that increase to the consumer, we could see inflation [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=138.26s)]
*  rise. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=144.1s)]
*  We also have a separate policy on immigration that could have a significant impact on the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=145.1s)]
*  labor market. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=149.85999999999999s)]
*  And think about industries that rely on a lot of immigrant population. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=151.17999999999998s)]
*  Think about agriculture or a lot of the meat packers or construction. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=156.94s)]
*  And I think that these two big Trump policies could actually impact the economy. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=162.06s)]
*  But again, without the details, it's really hard to know. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=168.16s)]
*  And I think that's another reason that the Fed just wants to wait and see what is announced, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=171.2s)]
*  what is implemented and how those policies impact the overall economy. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=176.72s)]
*  That will give the Fed much more direction in the future. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=182.12s)]
*  Yeah, and especially the Fed chair, Jerome Powell's comments and remarks. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=184.84s)]
*  I know you're always interested to see what words he does and does not use. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=187.96s)]
*  Jill Schlesinger, thanks for joining us this morning. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=191.3s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwB_aYA8jM&t=193.62s)]
