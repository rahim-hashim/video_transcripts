# Pam Bondi takes reins at DOJ as FBI employees sue over naming of Jan. 6 investigators
**CBS News:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o)
*  All right, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi will be sworn in today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=0.0s)]
*  She takes over the Department of Justice the day after multiple federal lawsuits were filed [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=3.84s)]
*  by FBI agents and employees who investigated January 6th. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=7.36s)]
*  They are trying to stop the public release of their names as part of a new DOJ investigation [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=10.46s)]
*  into the Capitol riot prosecution. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=15.44s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News Department of Justice correspondent Scott McFarland. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=17.48s)]
*  Scott, so I recall during Pam Bondi's confirmation hearing, she was asked very specifically about [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=22.16s)]
*  these types of situations, in other words, using politics as retribution for the work [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=29.8s)]
*  that the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was conducting. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  At the request, certainly, of the Department of Justice and the Attorney General Merrick [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=39.36s)]
*  Garland, she indicated that the Department of Justice would not be used in a political [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=42.8s)]
*  fashion. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=48.08s)]
*  So, how is she considering what is happening right now at the FBI? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=49.08s)]
*  This is quite a 24 hours, Vlad. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=54.540000000000006s)]
*  A new attorney general is going to walk into the building today, take over the reins of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=57.64s)]
*  the nation's law enforcement apparatus, bring in likely a whole bunch of new staff, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=61.92s)]
*  who we will see for the first time today. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=65.88s)]
*  And she's doing it during a day in which the FBI is in turmoil. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=68.48s)]
*  She's coming in amid a political and a professional brush fire. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=73.0s)]
*  The FBI has 5,000 or so of its agents and employees who are worried their names are [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=79.24s)]
*  on a list that is circulating inside Pam Bondi's new agency, and that it is at risk [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=85.08s)]
*  of being leaked or released to the public, putting them on a target list for harassment, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  threats and violence, including their families. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  That's the first day Pam Bondi is walking into. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=100.2s)]
*  A reminder about these lawsuits that have been filed against the Department of Justice [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=103.52s)]
*  by some of their own FBI agents. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=107.08s)]
*  They allege that the Department of Justice has required their names to be named as part [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=109.1s)]
*  of the January 6 investigation and that that list is going to be sent to the bosses at [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=113.74000000000001s)]
*  the Department of Justice for possible employment actions, possible firings or forced resignations, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=118.14s)]
*  simply for being part of that investigation. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=123.9s)]
*  They say it's a violation of their privacy, a violation of due process, but most vitriolically [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=126.46000000000001s)]
*  in their lawsuits they're arguing that they are now a target list, that people will come [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=132.1s)]
*  after them for being part of the January 6 investigations. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=136.74s)]
*  Pam Bondi will have to get her hands around that issue and what to do next with that list [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=140.58s)]
*  and those lawsuits as she approaches the new job as the nation's attorney general. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=146.74s)]
*  Yeah, Scott, it sort of is just, I don't know, to me it's commonsensical that you would [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=151.74s)]
*  not want to release those names of those agents unless the goal was, as they are suggesting, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=156.38s)]
*  for them to be targeted, either on social media or by people who would seek to do them [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=162.9s)]
*  harm. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=167.82s)]
*  So I wonder if the attorney general, I'm sure she's considering this, what this might [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=168.82s)]
*  do to recruiting efforts, if you are going to join an organization. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=172.7s)]
*  And let's remember, Scott, as you know better than I do, these agents are not just working [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=176.57999999999998s)]
*  on this one thing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=179.78s)]
*  These agents are involved in their careers, in multiple investigations, oftentimes undercover, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=181.2s)]
*  to go after some really, really, really bad people. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=186.82s)]
*  The idea of putting their names out there for all the public to know is something that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=189.22s)]
*  she's going to have to grapple with in addition to what that might mean for recruiting efforts [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=192.9s)]
*  down the line. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=196.98s)]
*  This is an absolute, utter mess. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=198.82s)]
*  In the past 72 hours or so have really broken some of the faith in this institution that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=201.02s)]
*  can't be repaired quickly, no matter what happens next. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=207.38s)]
*  Whether Pam Bondi decides to release publicly the names of all the FBI employees who were [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=210.3s)]
*  part of the January 6 investigations, or whether Pam Bondi takes out that piece of paper, crinkles [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=214.94s)]
*  it up and throws it in a trash can and says, we're done with this type of stuff, no matter [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=220.34s)]
*  what happens next, there's already been damage incurred. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=224.1s)]
*  There's been a message sent to FBI employees nationwide, according to sources speaking [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=227.17999999999998s)]
*  with CBS News, that you have to be careful what cases you investigate moving forward, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=231.29999999999998s)]
*  that they can't displease the president or his close allies. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=236.17999999999998s)]
*  That is a chilling message that goes against the DNA of the FBI, and it's been sent already, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=240.73999999999998s)]
*  no matter what happens next. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=247.06s)]
*  But your argument is, if you're Pam Bondi, is what good is there in releasing this list? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=248.5s)]
*  Maybe there's a political advantage to it, maybe there's a mandate to do it, but the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=255.66000000000003s)]
*  practical impact is potentially catastrophic for those agents and their day job, which [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=259.26s)]
*  is part of terror task forces, child trafficking units, gun units, violent crime units. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=264.62s)]
*  They are distracted, and potentially you could lose them from those vital missions. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=271.38s)]
*  All right, Scott, before we let you go quickly, you've got some new reporting on threats [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=275.54s)]
*  being made to members of Congress. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=279.02000000000004s)]
*  Tell me about that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=280.22s)]
*  Oh, by the way, threats against the Congress and the U.S. Capitol complex have hit a new [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=281.46000000000004s)]
*  high in 2024. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=288.58000000000004s)]
*  More than 9,000 of them have been investigated by U.S. Capitol Police, according to an investigation [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=290.98s)]
*  by CBS News and a federal report issued. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=296.98s)]
*  That's up from 8,008 in 2023, the largest number for a single year on record for the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=300.22s)]
*  Capitol Police, save for one year, 2021, which is a bit of a different kind of year [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=305.5s)]
*  because of the insurrection. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=311.18s)]
*  This is three times more. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=313.18s)]
*  Threat investigations in Capitol Police had just seven or eight years ago. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=315.26s)]
*  They are trying to figure out how to deal with that fire hose, how to protect members [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=318.58s)]
*  of Congress at what is clearly a distinctively toxic and politically violent moment. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=322.78s)]
*  Boy, oh boy, the shroud of the dark side has fallen. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=328.38s)]
*  Scott McFarland reporting for us. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=331.86s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvuji-bs0o&t=333.5s)]
