*  I think the last state visit was a tremendous success. His majesty the king wants to make this even better [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=108.76s)]

*  President Trump Andrew and Tristan Tate [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  Landed in Florida today on a private jet after being released from custody in Romania [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  They are accused rapists human traffickers [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=170.76000000000002s)]
*  Not thought of as good people in many circles [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=174.32s)]
*  Did your administration pressure the Romanian government to release them? And if so, I know nothing about that. I [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=179.16s)]
*  Don't know you're saying he's on a plane right now. Yeah, I just know nothing about it. We'll check it out. We'll let you know [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=186.44s)]
*  Obviously this involves there's an English element here [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=196.6s)]
*  So opposite support for justice is done and human trafficking is obviously to my mind a [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=199.2s)]
*  security risk and so [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  We'll catch up with the story and you're aware [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=207.12s)]
*  I didn't know anything about it [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=212.44s)]
*  Yes, we are [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=221.88s)]
*  We are and and we take good care of our veterans who were watching that very carefully and we hope it's good [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=223.6s)]
*  We're going to be a smaller number as possible, but we are having great success in slimming down our government [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=229.2s)]
*  It's been really very successful and some took payouts and buyouts and others [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=235.16s)]
*  Took other things and some people were finding out don't even exist [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=241.48s)]
*  We're finding that we have a lot of people that don't exist that people thought that did [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=244.72s)]
*  We will be making a statement of that, but we're taking care of our veterans. We love our veterans. We're going to take good care of them [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=249.12s)]
*  Mr. President, could you be persuaded as part of a peace settlement in Ukraine to provide air cover a [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=255.2s)]
*  Backstop security position to the contributions that you might make as well. Well, so [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=262.47999999999996s)]
*  President Zelensky is coming to see me on Friday Friday morning and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=268.28s)]
*  We're going to be signing really a very important agreement for both sides because it's really going to get us [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=272.91999999999996s)]
*  Into that country will be working there. We'll have a lot of people work in there [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=278.28s)]
*  And so in that sense, it's very good. It's a backstop you could say [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=281.76000000000005s)]
*  I don't think anybody's going to play around if we're there with a lot of workers and [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=284.84000000000003s)]
*  Having to do with rare earths and other things which we need for our country [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=289.32000000000005s)]
*  And we appreciate it very much and I look forward to seeing him [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  We'll be talking about it and we'll also be talking about that today with the Prime Minister [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=297.88000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I mean we as you know, we've already indicated that we'll play our full part [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=302.64000000000004s)]
*  As you know, we've already [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=308.32s)]
*  Indicated that will play our full part in making sure that any deal if there is one and I hope there is and I think [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=310.12s)]
*  This is a historic a moment to make sure it's a lasting deal and we about to have a discussion about [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=315.36s)]
*  How we can make that work, but I have to say this as I said yesterday, you know, you're talking about a peacekeeping force [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=320.68s)]
*  We have to make a deal first right now. We don't have a deal [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=327.28s)]
*  We have Russia we have Ukraine. I think we're very well advanced [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=330.8s)]
*  I think Russia has been acting [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=335.44s)]
*  very well [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=338.76000000000005s)]
*  Representative Steve Witkoff and Scott and Marco and JD were all involved every one of us and and a lot more [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=340.64000000000004s)]
*  But I think we're very well advanced on a deal, but we have not made a deal yet [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  So I don't like to talk about peacekeeping until we have a deal. I like to get things done. I don't want to give it the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=353.0s)]
*  The bad luck sign we don't want to do that [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=359.44000000000005s)]
*  But we've had very good talks with Russia and we've had very good talks as you know with Ukraine [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=361.56s)]
*  Yes, sir [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=365.64s)]
*  This prime minister have to choose a closer relationship with the EU is here seeking and a good trade relationship with you [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=366.64s)]
*  Which one? Well, I think we have just a great relationship. We actually had a good relationship before we've met a couple of times [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=372.0s)]
*  And I'm very impressed with him and very impressed with his wife. I must say she's a [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=379.2s)]
*  beautiful great woman and [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=385.12s)]
*  She's like I said [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=387.28s)]
*  Said you're very lucky. He's very lucky and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=389.67999999999995s)]
*  No, I we've had a very good relationship [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=393.28s)]
*  He's worried about Britain potentially undoing some of the benefits of brexit by seeking a closer tie with the EU who you said was [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=395.28s)]
*  Set up to screw me. I don't worry about that [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=401.4s)]
*  I don't I I thought you know [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=403.2s)]
*  Frankly what they did was the right thing at the time and I think that'll probably prove out over the centuries [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=404.96s)]
*  you know, you have a long time to go, but I think I [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=410.59999999999997s)]
*  Predicted that was going to happen and it did happen and it'll work itself out. It's it's I think it's already worked itself [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=414.36s)]
*  KS Tom was signed a deal to give away the che go silent to Mauritius. Will you approve that deal? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=424.36s)]
*  Well, we're gonna have some discussions about that very soon and I have a feeling it's gonna work out very well [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=429.44s)]
*  They're talking about a very long-term. Yeah, powerfully. It's a very strong lease [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=434.92s)]
*  About a hundred and forty years actually, it's a long time [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=439.8s)]
*  And I think we'll be inclined to go along with your country. Yeah, I think it's [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=443.96000000000004s)]
*  It's a little bit early. We have to get be given the details, but it doesn't sound bad. Yeah, please [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=450.92s)]
*  You obviously can do business with our Prime Minister Keir Starmer [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=456.6s)]
*  You said yesterday that the EU was constructed to screw the US when it comes to trade [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=460.6s)]
*  What can our Prime Minister say to you to persuade you not to impose tariffs on the United? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=467.0s)]
*  Yeah, did I use the word that you said that bad word? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=473.32s)]
*  Well, I think that the EU yeah, I've had problems with the EU because [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=478.24s)]
*  And we're not talking about we happen to have a great relationship with you [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=482.68s)]
*  But we did have and we do have problems with the EU because they've tariffed tariffed us [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=486.91999999999996s)]
*  They do it in the form of a VAT tax which is about 20% and many other taxes they sue our [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=492.28000000000003s)]
*  Companies they sued Apple [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=499.08000000000004s)]
*  Got 16 or 17 billion dollars, which was I think totally a ridiculous decision and [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=501.40000000000003s)]
*  They're suing Google for a lot of money. They're suing a lot of other companies and we don't like the way [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=509.6s)]
*  They're treating our people now. We don't like the way they're treating our companies [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=516.8000000000001s)]
*  They sell us cars we don't sell them cars they don't take our cars [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=520.72s)]
*  They don't take our much of our agriculture and we have a deficit with them of about 350 billion dollars [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=524.12s)]
*  So I wouldn't say it's been such a great relationship personally [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=531.88s)]
*  But other people did because it's politically correct to say that it's been good [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=535.4s)]
*  But it hasn't been good and we're gonna change that and we are gonna have reciprocal tariffs. We're not gonna have tariff [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=539.1800000000001s)]
*  We're gonna have reciprocal whatever they charge us [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=545.36s)]
*  Which [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=547.4000000000001s)]
*  For many years foolishly I would have done that but then all of a sudden we had Kovac and we had other things to [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=548.64s)]
*  Think about so it took me a little while to get that on and we but we had in my first four years [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=554.0s)]
*  We're the greatest economy in the history of I think the world but certainly in the history of our country [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=560.64s)]
*  I think we're gonna have that again, but the EU was very very tough on us and from the standpoint of trade [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=566.0400000000001s)]
*  Then you could take it a step further and go into [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=572.44s)]
*  NATO and [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=575.84s)]
*  That was a very tough situation for us [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=577.5200000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's been a very tough situation because we were paying a disproportionate share and [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=579.6800000000001s)]
*  Wasn't good. So as you know, they paid hundreds of billions of dollars after I got involved and [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=586.88s)]
*  They evened it out a little bit, but not very much and then if you look at the war [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=593.2s)]
*  We're in for [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=597.64s)]
*  300 billion dollars plus and they're in for a hundred billion they get their money back and now [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=599.24s)]
*  We'll get our money back also, but under Biden you wouldn't have done that Biden did a terrible job [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=604.56s)]
*  I have to say I hate to say that about [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=610.04s)]
*  Somebody that sat here just before me, but he did a terrible terrible job that war should have never happened the war between Russia Ukraine [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=613.1999999999999s)]
*  Frankly, October 7th should have never happened [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=621.88s)]
*  Israel that should have never happened what happened there should have never inflation should have never happened [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=624.8s)]
*  Afghanistan should have never happened the way they got out not getting out but the way they got out [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=630.2s)]
*  So but I can say that as far as we're for a different reason [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=635.36s)]
*  We're talking about a very different place and this is some place that I I have investments there. I have [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=639.0s)]
*  I own Turnberry. I know Aberdeen and I own a great place called Dunebeg in Ireland [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=645.84s)]
*  So, you know, I have I have a great warm spot for your country on our trade [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=652.0s)]
*  Obviously is fair balanced and that you've got a bit of a surplus [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=657.8s)]
*  So we're in a different position there and obviously we contributed hugely in relation to Ukraine and taken together with Europe [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=661.66s)]
*  There's about 50% in work [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=668.4399999999999s)]
*  Thank you, so does that mean there won't be any sanctions on the UK [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=675.2s)]
*  Well, I have to take a look [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=678.76s)]

*  Some people that probably aren't as talented to them, but they're pretty good Marco. What do you think? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=686.84s)]
*  Our people are pretty good. And now we're gonna have a good discussion and we'll be talking about [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=692.0799999999999s)]
*  Mr. Stammer the Prime Minister has said that he believes that Vladimir Putin would be at risk of invading Ukraine again without a sufficient backstop [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=699.04s)]
*  Do you think that Vladimir Putin would be likely to invade again in the end of the peace deal? I don't think so [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2R_76pyqV4&t=707.0799999999999s)]
