# Judge warns Oath Keepers founder he is not allowed in D.C. without permission
**CBS News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38)
*  So days ago, President Donald Trump commuted the sentence of Oath Keepers founder Stuart [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=0.0s)]
*  Rhodes. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=4.68s)]
*  Wednesday, Rhodes returned to the scene of that U.S. Capitol attack of January 6. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=5.68s)]
*  So fast forward to today, a federal judge told Rhodes he's not allowed back into Washington, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  D.C. without court permission. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=15.08s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News political reporter Jake Rosen. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=16.7s)]
*  So Jake, question for you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=19.96s)]
*  If Rhodes got the green light from the president, how can the judge actually do this? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=21.04s)]
*  Well, it appears that the federal judge, Amit Mehta, made the decision after Rhodes kind [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=26.76s)]
*  of gallivanted around the Capitol this week at the invitation of a lawmaker and had lunch [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=32.68s)]
*  in the Capitol cafeteria just feet from where he and other members of his organization, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=37.38s)]
*  the Oath Keepers, stormed the Capitol. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=43.08s)]
*  Now, while Rhodes says he did not go into the Capitol building, other members of his organization [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  did, and this order from Judge Mehta applies to all members of those eight in total Oath [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=49.6s)]
*  Keepers who were charged and convicted and then had their sentences commuted by Donald [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=55.24s)]
*  Trump on Monday. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  So on the subject of pardons, though, we know what the reaction is from Democrats. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=60.84s)]
*  We know the reaction is from Capitol Police, but you have some reporting on reaction from [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=64.76s)]
*  Republicans. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=68.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=71.44s)]
*  And we've really seen a massive shift in tone over the last two years, as we've talked about [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=72.44s)]
*  consistently here, where really voices like Ted Cruz and JD Vance went from saying right [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=76.0s)]
*  after the attack on the Capitol that there should be no pardons of these violent defendants [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  to kind of a rolling as Donald Trump really looked like he was going to clinch the nomination [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  and to what really manifested itself in this mass blanket pardon on Monday and Tuesday. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=90.92s)]
*  We've really seen a shift in tone and not many GOP senators have spoken out. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=96.36s)]
*  There are about five by my count, including Mitch McConnell, Susan Collins, Senator Lisa [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  Murkowski and Tom Tillis, who all said there should have been better vetting of some of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=104.16s)]
*  these pardons, making sure that there was a delineation between those who were convicted [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=108.52s)]
*  and charged of violent acts and those people who were just charged of illegal trespassing [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=112.88s)]
*  into the Capitol. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=117.28s)]
*  Although, as we know, Donald Trump essentially did a blanket pardon on all these people. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=118.28s)]
*  Even JD Vance just about a week ago and Speaker Mike Johnson said that there should be some [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=122.12s)]
*  kind of parsing here to not just blanket pardon everyone, although Donald Trump seemed to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=126.52s)]
*  not even listen to members of his inner circle like those two. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=131.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=134.04s)]
*  The president has been widely called the shoot from the hit president and that this took [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=135.2s)]
*  a lot of people by surprise. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  But it was a campaign promise. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=140.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=141.92s)]
*  Those pardons, something he promised voters who looks like they greenlit by electing him [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=142.92s)]
*  president. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=148.16s)]
*  We wanted to talk about another campaign promise. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=149.16s)]
*  And of course, that is these mass deportations. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=150.56s)]
*  We understand you have some new reporting on ICE conducting what it calls operations [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=152.88s)]
*  that were targeted at workplaces in Newark, New Jersey. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=157.44s)]
*  The mayor criticizing it, saying it violates the Fourth Amendment because officers didn't [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=161.4s)]
*  have a warrant. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=165.56s)]
*  Let's talk about this. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=166.56s)]
*  But first, we want to let our viewers listen to what the mayor had to say. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=167.56s)]
*  Now we can't quibble about the Fourth Amendment. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=174.24s)]
*  We can't quibble about the 14th Amendment. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=177.88s)]
*  That everybody has a right to do process that we should be secure in our person, in our [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=179.88s)]
*  papers, in our property from undue search and seizure. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=184.4s)]
*  Some smart men came up with this a long time ago. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=189.24s)]
*  And now it's the constitutional laws that we live by. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  And nobody has the right to go around those laws, to disregard them. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=197.88s)]
*  It's a slippery slope when we think it's okay to suspend the Constitution of the United [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=204.12s)]
*  States in order to make a political point or statement. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=209.16000000000003s)]
*  So, in that ICE response in their letter that they put out, they say, well, in a very cavalier [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=214.4s)]
*  way, these things happen. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=222.72s)]
*  There will be some citizens who are going to ask for their ID in their paperwork. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=227.04s)]
*  There are going to be some citizens who we stop and question. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=233.04s)]
*  So then my response to that is how do you determine who's undocumented and who's a [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=237.04s)]
*  criminal just by looking at them? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  So that's the mayor of Newark, New Jersey. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=247.72s)]
*  He talks about undue search and seizure protections. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=249.44s)]
*  That's what he's saying at his podium. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=253.48s)]
*  Can we anticipate that that same argument will be made in the courts when we talk about [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=255.04s)]
*  New Jersey? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=258.76s)]
*  And it's certainly possible. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=261.76s)]
*  We'll see what Mayor Baraka does in terms of taking, potentially alongside the government [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=263.48s)]
*  of New Jersey, taking a step towards suing the federal government for this aid. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=267.92s)]
*  And we'll see whether these kind of actions happen, these mass immigration raids and deportations [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  that would follow happen in other states as well who would also take objection to this. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=277.0s)]
*  I think we have to remember to point out, too, that while there were some people detained [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=280.92s)]
*  in this raid who even the owner of the seafood shop says were illegal immigrants, there are [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=284.76s)]
*  also the mayor and the owner of the seafood store says there was a U.S. military veteran [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=289.64s)]
*  who was detained at least temporarily by this. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  Both the mayor and the owner of the store said there was no kind of warrant that was [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=296.47999999999996s)]
*  brought to the owner, that they basically just stormed in and started asking employees [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=300.56s)]
*  to prove documentation and to prove that they were U.S. citizens, whether it's through a [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=304.12s)]
*  passport or a driver's license. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  Those who were unable to do so were then detained by ICE. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  And again, this is part of that campaign promise that you just talked about, Reid. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=313.88s)]
*  Donald Trump has promised these immigration raids, has promised to kind of show a force [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=317.04s)]
*  all across the country. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=320.44s)]
*  We'll see how big and how large these kind of scale up over the next couple of days. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=321.6s)]
*  But doing it near New York City is certainly a targeted message, especially in a blue state [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  and a sanctuary city like Newark. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=330.12s)]
*  Jake Rosen, thank you so much for that update. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  I have a feeling we'll be having this conversation a lot more here on the stream. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=333.8s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vCyDV0F38&t=337.04s)]
