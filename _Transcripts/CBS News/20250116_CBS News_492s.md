# What to know about Netanyahu claim that Hamas is backtracking on parts of ceasefire deal
**CBS News:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE)
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is accusing Hamas of backtracking on parts [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=0.0s)]
*  of the Gaza ceasefire deal announced yesterday, claiming the group is attempting to gain further [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=6.04s)]
*  concessions. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=10.16s)]
*  And until the issue is resolved, Netanyahu says his cabinet will not meet to approve [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=11.16s)]
*  the agreement. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=15.38s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Rami Nissencio is following the latest for us from Tel Aviv [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=16.38s)]
*  and joins me now to discuss. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=20.72s)]
*  So Rami, it's been hard for us to understand here in the United States what actually is [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=22.62s)]
*  the holdup. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=27.6s)]
*  At one point we've heard from everybody, from members of the Biden administration to local [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=28.64s)]
*  media reports that the sticking point has more to do with politics and whether Prime [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu is able to sell this to his coalition in the Knesset. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=39.24s)]
*  Now we're hearing it maybe has to do with Hamas. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=43.72s)]
*  What are you hearing? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=46.36s)]
*  Yeah, well, first off, on the face of it, this news will be frustrating and disheartening [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=49.36s)]
*  for people on both sides of this conflict. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=55.84s)]
*  We're in Israel waiting for those hostages to finally come home and also in Gaza for [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=57.86s)]
*  a cessation of the bombing over the past 466 days. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=63.26s)]
*  Now earlier today we got first word notifications that the cabinet approval had been delayed. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=67.7s)]
*  And then we got a statement from the prime minister's office saying in a statement here [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=74.53999999999999s)]
*  that Hamas reneged on parts of the deal, the claim there to extort last minute concessions. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=78.14s)]
*  Now the discussion here from Israeli media is that this may have to do with which Palestinian [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=85.05999999999999s)]
*  detainees may be released in exchange for Israeli hostages. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=91.3s)]
*  The initial agreement apparently was that both sides had agreed that some people, some [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=96.61999999999999s)]
*  detainees would be off limits. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=100.89999999999999s)]
*  But now it's being reported that Hamas actually wants to have in effect a veto and a final [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=102.66s)]
*  say on which detainees would potentially come out. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=107.91999999999999s)]
*  My read on this is that they may be wanting potentially higher value targets, higher value [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=111.88s)]
*  detainees, past activists, past leaders of Hamas who could also be potential future leaders [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  to take over for all those who have already been killed. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=122.82s)]
*  It's such a head scratcher because presumably this would have been raised during those meetings [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=125.44s)]
*  in Qatar and you had both the United States, the Qataris and the Israelis all there trying [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=130.5s)]
*  to hammer out this deal. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=138.24s)]
*  We would expect that Hamas would say these are the people that we want released from [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=139.72s)]
*  these Israeli prisons. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=143.08s)]
*  So if they're not able to get over this hurdle, Remy, then what happens? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=145.6s)]
*  Right now the read is that on both sides they're saying that they are committed to this. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=153.2s)]
*  Hamas did come out with a statement a couple hours ago saying that they are committed to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=161.28s)]
*  One local Israeli news station also said that they believe that this is going to be resolved. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=162.28s)]
*  If that happens, then it would go to the security cabinet made up of five ministers. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=169.04s)]
*  It would then go to wider and wider circles of approval. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  It would go to the full cabinet made of 10 ministers. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  Then it would go to the Knesset, the Israeli parliament with 120 people. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=180.64s)]
*  If that happens, and depending on how this pause in the talks has impacted the future [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=185.56s)]
*  timeline, we may still see the first hostages come out of Gaza this Sunday. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=192.72s)]
*  I'm not quite sure how this has impacted, but so far we haven't heard any change on [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=198.04s)]
*  that timeline. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  Off of that, then phase one would start and we would see the exchange, the release of [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  Also we'd see the Israeli military then pull back from population centers in the center [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  part of Gaza to the perimeters. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=214.5s)]
*  But again, this hasn't been signed. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=217.04s)]
*  It's been announced, but it still has not been signed. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=219.84s)]
*  So we're still waiting for that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=221.64s)]
*  All right, Rami Nissencio, the whole world also awaiting to hear what we all hope is [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=224.0s)]
*  good news, which is the cessation of hostilities and those hostages coming home. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=229.12s)]
*  Rami Nissencio, doing some excellent reporting on the ground for us in Tel Aviv. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  We appreciate you, brother. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=236.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=237.68s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News White House reporter Willie James Inman for more. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=238.68s)]
*  So Willie, you heard the conversation that I just had with Rami. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=243.32s)]
*  You presumably heard the conversation that we had with a person from the State Department [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=246.72s)]
*  this morning on CBS Mornings who essentially said that they believe that this deal is happening. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=251.64s)]
*  The Biden administration has been working on this for months. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=256.88s)]
*  The president suggesting yesterday that he had been working and proposing a deal like [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=259.47999999999996s)]
*  this way back in May. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=263.91999999999996s)]
*  So the key issue that seems to be also being discussed now is the role that the Trump team [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  played in all this. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=273.12s)]
*  What are you hearing about that? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=274.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's right, Vlad. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=276.12s)]
*  Part of the reason why you're seeing this deal come about and President Biden talking [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=278.44s)]
*  about how both his team and the incoming Trump team work together is because they want to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=282.52s)]
*  make sure that they present a united front, that Hamas doesn't exploit any differences [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=287.36s)]
*  between the Biden team and the Trump team. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=292.36s)]
*  In fact, President Biden, after that meeting, that Oval Office meeting with then President [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=295.4s)]
*  Elect Trump, following the results of the 2024 election, directed his team to work with [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=300.08s)]
*  President Trump's team to make sure that they're on the same page. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=306.08s)]
*  In fact, his envoy, the envoy that I should mention that the president elect has appointed [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=310.04s)]
*  to that position, Steve Witkoff, went to the Middle East, traveled to the Middle East to [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=315.64s)]
*  meet with leaders, including Prime Minister Netanyahu, to bring President Trump's thoughts [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=320.52s)]
*  to the table with all of this. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=325.88s)]
*  So both men, both presidents taking some credit here. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=327.64s)]
*  But I will point out that the White House has been on the same page, the same footing, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=332.1s)]
*  because in large part, this deal will have to be carried out by the president elect's [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=336.46000000000004s)]
*  team instead of the Biden team, because really the weeks and months that will come will have [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=341.26000000000005s)]
*  to wait and see what happens with this deal and how it all plays out. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=346.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, indeed. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=351.06s)]
*  The president, as you know, delivered that final address to the nation. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=352.58000000000004s)]
*  So for all extensive purposes, whatever happens, which is supposed to take place on Sunday, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=355.56s)]
*  will be part of the Trump administration. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=360.54s)]
*  But going back to that speech from last night, Willie James, what did the president have [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=363.58000000000004s)]
*  to say about wealth inequality in the United States? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it was certainly an interesting speech, to say the least, because President Biden [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=371.86s)]
*  didn't necessarily spend all of his time talking about his legacy. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=378.70000000000005s)]
*  He talked about how there's a threat of an oligarchy, some tech billionaires controlling [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=382.34000000000003s)]
*  American society. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=388.70000000000005s)]
*  Listen to what he had to say last night. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=389.98s)]
*  I want to warn the country of some things that give me great concern. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=392.90000000000003s)]
*  This is a dangerous constant, and that's the dangerous concentration of power in the hands [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=398.3s)]
*  of a very few ultra wealthy people. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=402.66s)]
*  The dangerous consequences if their abuse of power is left unchecked. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=405.58000000000004s)]
*  Today an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=411.5s)]
*  literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=417.62s)]
*  Now the president didn't name names, but it's not hard to figure out who he's talking about [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=424.1s)]
*  here. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=429.14s)]
*  Perhaps Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, two men who really have grown closer to Trump, especially [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=430.14s)]
*  Elon Musk, since he controls X and Mark Zuckerberg, of course, controls a Metta Facebook and Instagram. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=436.02s)]
*  It's clear that President Biden wanted to give this warning of sorts to the American [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=444.32s)]
*  people to make sure that they stand guard, essentially, using his words in that speech [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=449.8s)]
*  to his final farewell address from the Oval Office last night to the American people. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=455.0s)]
*  He did, of course, touch on some of the things that he believes were major accomplishments [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=460.36s)]
*  during his four years in office. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=464.68s)]
*  But Vlad, this was the more interesting part of his speech. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=467.04s)]
*  About nine minutes or so into it he started to go into this threat against American society, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=471.16s)]
*  but also talking about how social media and the lack of fact checking, which has been [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=476.6s)]
*  a major shift and change with some of these social media platforms, how Americans should [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=480.20000000000005s)]
*  be wary of misinformation and disinformation, Vlad. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=484.24s)]
*  All right, Willie James Inman for us at the White House. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=488.20000000000005s)]
*  Thank you, Willie James. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjMDx-2qhE&t=490.6s)]
