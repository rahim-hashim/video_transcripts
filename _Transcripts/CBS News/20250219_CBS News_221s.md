# Trump signs executive order to give White House power over regulatory agencies
**CBS News:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM)
*  President Trump has signed an executive order meant to give him more control over regulatory government agencies [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=0.0s)]
*  He's requiring them to send the White House any regulation proposals to be reviewed [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=6.84s)]
*  The order also says these agencies cannot spend money on anything that doesn't align with the administration [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=11.6s)]
*  Let's connect now with CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes who is following all of this for us from West Palm Beach [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=18.04s)]
*  this morning Nancy part of the executive order Trump sign says [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=23.96s)]
*  Agencies must follow how the president and attorney general interpret the law help us understand what that means [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=28.2s)]
*  What it means Errol is that often [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=37.28s)]
*  Various government agencies and departments as laws come in they will interpret those laws and incorporate them into [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  their programs and policies and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=48.72s)]
*  And what this executive order is now saying is that actually no those decisions all get made [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=51.44s)]
*  By the office of the presidency itself by the president of the United States [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=57.72s)]
*  So it's another effort to concentrate power not in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=62.44s)]
*  You know various departments of the government, but actually at the White House itself [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=66.92s)]
*  And the executive order even goes a step farther Errol and says that this even applies to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=71.76s)]
*  quasi-independent [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=78.36s)]
*  government agencies like the Federal Communications Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission the Federal Election Commission [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=80.0s)]
*  That have long had some autonomy from the White House and in fact were created that way [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=87.24s)]
*  What this executive order is now saying is that they've got to run [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=93.64s)]
*  Their interpretations of the law by the White House as well and that their funding could be impacted if the White House [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=98.52s)]
*  Determines that they are making decisions without White House input and Nancy one of the more remarkable [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=107.08s)]
*  Comments from President Trump was on the war in Ukraine that aired yesterday President Trump said Ukraine quote should have ended it [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=113.4s)]
*  After three years you should have never started it. What does that tell us about how the president views Russia's invasion? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=120.8s)]
*  Well, it would appear Errol that at every turn when he is asked about this invasion [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=129.6s)]
*  he tends to find fault not with the Russians who [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=134.36s)]
*  invaded but [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=138.12s)]
*  Fault by the Ukrainians who were invaded. Not only did he say yesterday that the Ukrainians never should have [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=140.12s)]
*  Started this war which is obviously patently false, but he also [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=148.56s)]
*  accused the president of Ukraine of [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=152.96s)]
*  Dragging his heels on cutting a deal and he said that President Vladimir Zelensky of Ukraine has a [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=156.32s)]
*  An approval rating that is now at 4% [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=163.12s)]
*  Which is not true as Zelensky's approval rating is set about 50% similar to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=166.16s)]
*  President Trump's approval rating here in the United States [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  He also criticized Zelensky for imposing martial law suggesting that that's undemocratic again [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  Without acknowledging that the reason that martial law has been imposed in Ukraine is because it was invaded by its much larger and more [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=181.95999999999998s)]
*  Powerful neighbor and this is really [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=190.35999999999999s)]
*  It really goes beyond semantics [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=192.76s)]
*  Errol because what it indicates to the Ukrainians and what they worry about is the fact that as [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=195.67999999999998s)]
*  The president moves quite quickly to begin negotiations with Russia [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  Overending this war they fear that that he is going to conduct those negotiations on Russia's terms and not on theirs [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  Really interesting Nancy Kouros joining us from West Palm Beach. Thank you, Nancy [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3lgycalMyM&t=217.0s)]
