# Robert F. Kennedy Jr. confirmed as HHS secretary in 52-48 vote
**CBS News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4)
*  Right now the Senate voting to confirm RFP Jumira's health at human services secretary [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=0.0s)]
*  who's one of President Trump's most controversial cabinet picks due to his opinions on vaccines. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=5.2s)]
*  But he got 51 votes meaning he has enough to be confirmed. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=10.8s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News Capitol Hill reporter Torian Small. Torian, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  thanks for being with us again today. What is the significance of all this? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=19.04s)]
*  Well, Mugo, it means that Republicans are now unwilling to break with those in their party [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=22.72s)]
*  and those in Trump's orbit after an intense pressure campaign for quite a few Republican [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=32.32s)]
*  members including Bill Cassidy. He's the chair of the corresponding committee that oversees [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=38.08s)]
*  jurisdiction for the Department of Health and Human Services. The Louisiana senator [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  expressed during the confirmation hearing for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that he was struggling with [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=49.84s)]
*  this confirmation as he has previously supported and endorsed misinformation around America's [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=54.96s)]
*  health care system. But ultimately after counsel and his words from JD Vance, the vice president, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  talking to advisors at the White House and multiple conversations with Kennedy himself, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=69.12s)]
*  he decided he would not only be voting him out of committee but also voting for his confirmation [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=74.88s)]
*  on the Senate floor as we saw today. The one Republican though who decided to break with the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=81.52s)]
*  party was Mitch McConnell, the longest serving party leader has once again decided that he would [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  vote against Trump will for his pick as next incoming cabinet member. Ultimately having [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=94.72s)]
*  reservations about Kennedy's qualifications as his reason why he wouldn't be supporting him. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=102.4s)]
*  But again, like you said, Republicans have the numbers. Robert F. Kennedy will likely be sworn [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  in in a matter of hours at the White House. That's according to a staff member to Caroline Levitt [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=113.04s)]
*  at the White House today. And Torian, we're hearing he has been officially confirmed so he [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  got all the votes he needed to make it through. We know RFK is expected to give a press conference [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  on his plans to make America healthy again. Do we know what his goals are here and what that looks like? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=129.92s)]
*  Well what's interesting in his opening statement during his confirmation hearings, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=139.27999999999997s)]
*  he reiterated the fact that his journey into this health care story for himself started as [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=143.76s)]
*  an environmental lawyer. He's looking at this in his mind holistically and decided that he wanted to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=151.44s)]
*  not just preach the word about being healthy but also implement policy or influence policy [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=158.16s)]
*  that would do the same. He's been highly critical about the additives in America's foods and he [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  says that it's time that the government step in intervene and do something about it. When it comes [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=171.28s)]
*  to vaccines, which has been the biggest hang up with not just Republicans or not just Democrats, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=176.32000000000002s)]
*  but some Republicans, he said that he isn't an anti-vaccine person although he has previously [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=181.84s)]
*  spread anti or information that is categorized as anti-vax. He says that he just wants to ensure the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=188.96s)]
*  efficacy and the safety of these the medication and vaccines going into American's bodies. So [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=197.76s)]
*  ultimately that's what we should expect to see under his leadership at the Department of Health [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=205.44s)]
*  and Human Services. All right, Torian Small, thank you so much for your time today and again [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=209.84s)]
*  the big picture coming out of all of this. RFK Jr. now confirmed as the secretary or at least [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=214.8s)]
*  leading the Health and Human Services. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG1DdugqBb4&t=221.2s)]
