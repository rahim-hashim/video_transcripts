# Trump administration pauses all federal grants and loans
**CBS News:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc)
*  We begin this hour with major moves by the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=0.0s)]
*  The Trump administration has paused [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=3.68s)]
*  all federal grants and loans. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=6.04s)]
*  While it will not pause social security [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=8.52s)]
*  or Medicare benefits, there is now a temporary hold [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=10.64s)]
*  on all programs related to DEI, the Green New Deal, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=13.92s)]
*  and foreign aid assistance. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=17.96s)]
*  Also, the president signed four executive orders [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=20.1s)]
*  focused on the military, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=22.72s)]
*  which include eliminating diversity programs [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  and setting in motion a potential future ban [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=26.96s)]
*  on transgender troops. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=30.12s)]
*  Separately, the acting attorney general fired [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=32.32s)]
*  more than a dozen prosecutors who worked [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=35.2s)]
*  with special counsel Jack Smith [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=37.44s)]
*  on the two federal prosecutions of Trump. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=39.2s)]
*  The president touted all of his moves [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=42.36s)]
*  since taking office last week, last night. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=44.32000000000001s)]
*  I've taken over 350 executive actions. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=47.88s)]
*  We've signed 300, and whoever heard of that one? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=51.0s)]
*  And as I said in my inaugural address, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=53.4s)]
*  the American decline is over. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=60.08s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Natalie Brand [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=64.28s)]
*  is following all of this for us [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=66.08s)]
*  from the White House this morning. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=67.38s)]
*  Natalie, CBS News has verified this memo [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=68.98s)]
*  about a potential pause on federal funding, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=71.88s)]
*  but help us understand its legality. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Democratic lawmakers say it's just not legal [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=79.32s)]
*  that a lot of this money was appropriated by Congress [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=82.14s)]
*  through legislation, but if you read the memo, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=85.62s)]
*  what CBS News has verified, as you were talking about, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=89.3s)]
*  it really seeks to take aim at policies [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=93.22s)]
*  and priorities of the previous administration, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  the Biden administration, when you look at some [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=100.86s)]
*  of the diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=103.12s)]
*  clean energy spending and things like that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=106.76s)]
*  This wants to align federal spending [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=109.58s)]
*  with Trump administration priorities. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=112.86s)]
*  But again, Democratic appropriators are saying [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=115.5s)]
*  it's Congress that has the power of the purse. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=119.1s)]
*  Actually, Senator Patty Murray, the ranking Democrat [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=121.98s)]
*  on the Senate Appropriations Committee, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=126.14s)]
*  and her counterpart in the House, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=129.94s)]
*  wrote to the Office of Management and Budget last night [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=131.74s)]
*  and said, calling on them to uphold the law, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=135.82s)]
*  saying that this has the potential to disrupt programs, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=139.76s)]
*  this could impact funding to state and local governments [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=144.0s)]
*  through grants and cause great upheaval. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=148.44s)]
*  But again, there's a lot of pushback, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=151.68s)]
*  and we'll really have to see how this plays out [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=154.3s)]
*  and whether it's also open to legal challenges. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=157.56s)]
*  Help us understand these executive actions taken by Trump [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  on the military, and specifically, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  transgender service members who are currently serving. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=166.46s)]
*  Well, you might remember, Errol, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=171.86s)]
*  that this is something that happened [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=173.02s)]
*  under the first Trump administration as well [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=174.54000000000002s)]
*  in order to ban transgender members in the military. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=178.34s)]
*  The executive order signed Monday [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=183.34s)]
*  doesn't explicitly ban transgender military members [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=186.78s)]
*  right away, but kind of paves the way [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=190.62s)]
*  and asks for a new policy to be developed. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=193.02s)]
*  But again, this is something that we saw [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=198.02s)]
*  during the first Trump administration. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=200.62s)]
*  Some of the other military-related executive orders, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=202.86s)]
*  the president wants to reinstate service members [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=206.66000000000003s)]
*  who were removed for refusing to get the COVID vaccine [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=210.70000000000002s)]
*  under the Biden administration. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=215.9s)]
*  He wants to reinstate those members with back pay, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=217.74s)]
*  as he said after he took the oath of office last week. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=220.66s)]
*  Another interesting one signed wants to create a process [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=226.22s)]
*  to build, create an iron dome for the United States. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=231.54s)]
*  That, of course, the iron dome is something we talk about, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=235.8s)]
*  the missile defense system in Israel. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=238.5s)]
*  He wants to create one here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=241.5s)]
*  But again, this is all part of a big push to, in his view, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=243.85999999999999s)]
*  purge the Department of Defense from DI initiatives [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=249.66000000000003s)]
*  and policies that he and his new defense secretary, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=254.9s)]
*  newly confirmed defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=258.86s)]
*  believe impact readiness. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=261.86s)]
*  They want to return the military [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=264.46000000000004s)]
*  to what they call a warrior culture. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  And quickly, Natalie, I'll ask you about the DOJ choice [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=269.18s)]
*  to fire those connected to Jack Smith. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=272.22s)]
*  We received a statement from the acting AG [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=274.58000000000004s)]
*  saying they couldn't be trusted [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=277.26s)]
*  to faithfully execute the president's agenda. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=278.58s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=280.58s)]
*  Yeah, again, this is something that the president signaled [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=282.68s)]
*  he would do, trying to, what he calls, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=285.0s)]
*  end the weaponization of the Department of Justice. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=287.62s)]
*  But legal experts and analysts out there say [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=291.5s)]
*  this really shatters norms and risks the independence [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=293.86s)]
*  of the Department of Justice, which, as you know, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=298.38s)]
*  is supposed to act as an independent body, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=301.09999999999997s)]
*  apart from the White House, apart from Congress. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=304.98s)]
*  It also remains to be seen, Errol, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=308.1s)]
*  whether any of these prosecutors try to challenge [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=310.02000000000004s)]
*  these firings under the protections that they might have. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=313.3s)]
*  So again, a lot of these threads to be continued. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=317.06s)]
*  All right, Natalie Brand, with the latest for us there [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=320.72s)]
*  from the White House, thank you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjLMRyVvtc&t=323.02000000000004s)]
