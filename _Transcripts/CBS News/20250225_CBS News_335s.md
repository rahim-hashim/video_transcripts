# What a potential Ukraine mineral deal could look like
**CBS News:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU)
*  Well, welcome back to America Decides. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=0.0s)]
*  Just a few moments ago in the Oval Office, President Trump said he is open to Ukrainian [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=2.44s)]
*  President Volodymyr Zelensky visiting Washington later this week to sign a deal that would [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=6.32s)]
*  grant U.S. access to Ukraine's mineral reserves. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=11.5s)]
*  This is what the president said Ukraine would receive in exchange. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=14.4s)]
*  Three hundred and fifty billion dollars and lots of equipment and military equipment and [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=19.32s)]
*  the right to fight on. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=24.0s)]
*  This comes just one day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said he is open to selling [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=26.32s)]
*  minerals from both Russia and Russian occupied areas of Ukraine to the Trump administration. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=31.0s)]
*  Trump said purchasing these minerals from him is, that is to say Putin, not out of the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=38.44s)]
*  question. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=43.08s)]
*  Graceland Baskarin is the director of Critical Mineral Security Program at the Center for [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=44.64s)]
*  Strategic and International Studies. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=49.28s)]
*  Graceland, it's great to have you at the desk. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=52.8s)]
*  CBS News hasn't confirmed something, but you believe you have some understood language [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=54.32s)]
*  about what's been agreed to between the United States and Ukraine. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=58.88s)]
*  What is it? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=62.64s)]
*  President Trump and Zelensky reached an agreement earlier this afternoon on a minerals deal. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=63.64s)]
*  It's the first of its kind. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=67.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=68.92s)]
*  And the minerals deal looks a bit different to where we started. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=69.92s)]
*  Originally, President Trump had said he wanted five hundred million dollars to be repaid [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=72.72s)]
*  for military former military assistance that had been provided. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=76.88s)]
*  And President Zelensky said we didn't get five hundred billion dollars. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=81.08s)]
*  They didn't. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=84.2s)]
*  No, it's closer to, I think, in the ballpark of one hundred and twenty eight billion. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=85.2s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=87.76s)]
*  So we've seen that five hundred billion dollars figure disappear. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=88.76s)]
*  OK. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=91.76s)]
*  We've also not seen a security guarantee. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=92.76s)]
*  President Zelensky was hoping to have a security guarantee included in it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=95.0s)]
*  It didn't. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=98.4s)]
*  Instead, it's a very high level of agreement that basically says that they will set up [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=99.4s)]
*  a fund for future monetizable assets where 50 percent of the revenue will go into this [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=103.56s)]
*  can be used to fund things like future reconstruction of Ukraine. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=110.54s)]
*  There's a lot of unknowns that are left at a high level like will we jointly develop [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=114.94000000000001s)]
*  assets hasn't really been ironed out. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=118.9s)]
*  So as I understand it, there are some things in Ukraine of interest to the United States. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=122.26s)]
*  Lithium, graphite, titaniums, zirconium, things like antimony, gallium, germanium. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=127.18s)]
*  These are all things necessary for either weapons or high tech equipment. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=135.26s)]
*  I'm generalizing. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=140.42s)]
*  Correct. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=141.42s)]
*  Those are all the things that we're sort of interested in. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=142.42s)]
*  You got it exactly right. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=144.14s)]
*  OK. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=145.34s)]
*  They're hard to get to. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=146.34s)]
*  Mining takes a long time and it's expensive to find them. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=147.66s)]
*  And do we even know how much of these things Ukraine actually has? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=150.98s)]
*  You're asking the exact questions that I think a lot of the private sector is asking. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=154.66s)]
*  We're relying on data that's 30 to 60 years old and that was generated by the Soviet Union [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=159.57999999999998s)]
*  At that time, technology, which was much older, some of the minerals that we talked about [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=164.5s)]
*  for advanced semiconductors were not things that we were thinking about as being particularly [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=168.54000000000002s)]
*  important. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=172.86s)]
*  And importantly is we basically have made an agreement with very little data. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=174.14000000000001s)]
*  So you've seen this to largely be a government conversation without the private sector. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=178.10000000000002s)]
*  And let's be candid. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=182.46s)]
*  This war has ravaged Ukraine on many levels. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=184.38s)]
*  Among them, infrastructure. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=188.42000000000002s)]
*  And having read your reports on this, you can mine all you want, but if you don't have [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=190.78s)]
*  the means by which to move the materials through infrastructure that is reliable and resilient, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=195.94s)]
*  you don't have much. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=202.22s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=203.22s)]
*  Transportation infrastructure is really important. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=204.22s)]
*  But even energy, I mean, close to one fifth of the world's energy is used on the mining [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=206.06s)]
*  industry. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=210.5s)]
*  And a lot of this energy infrastructure was bombed out during... [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=211.5s)]
*  Intentionally by Russia. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=215.38s)]
*  Very intentionally. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=216.38s)]
*  So not only do I have to build a mine and take the risk of developing a mine, I now [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=217.46s)]
*  have to finance significant infrastructure development to actually make these resources [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=221.26s)]
*  monetizable. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=226.06s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=227.06s)]
*  Yesterday, French President Manuel Macron was asked if France would be comfortable with [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=228.06s)]
*  this kind of arrangement. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=235.18s)]
*  And he said yes, because it would be a very good security agreement for Ukraine. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=236.9s)]
*  The United States would have a vested interest in wanting to maintain its deal with Ukraine. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=240.57999999999998s)]
*  Therefore, that would suggest it was interested in its long-term sovereignty and its protection. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=246.26s)]
*  Is that implied, do you think, in this kind of conversation, whatever they've signed [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=251.62s)]
*  or agreed to? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=256.18s)]
*  The hope is that there would be security guarantee. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=257.65999999999997s)]
*  But I can tell you that the private sector feels a little bit differently. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=259.7s)]
*  It's without intentional explicit agreements about long-term security. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=262.3s)]
*  The electoral cycle is only four years long. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=266.58s)]
*  It takes 18 years to develop a mine, on average, globally. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=268.88s)]
*  And then the mine can run for another 30 to 80 years. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=273.12s)]
*  So we're talking about a period that is much longer than the security guarantee of one [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=277.1s)]
*  United States president. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=281.36s)]
*  And that's where an explicit written guarantee is more valuable than the implicit guarantee, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=283.34000000000003s)]
*  because already this agreement supersedes any trade agreement we have with Ukraine. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=288.12s)]
*  And if I hear you correctly, those who would be in the private sector and want to develop [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  this want to see that in print. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=296.66s)]
*  They want to know what they're getting themselves into before they plunge all these many millions [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=299.72s)]
*  or hundreds of millions of dollars of whatever it costs to try to extract these minerals. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=303.98s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=307.94000000000005s)]
*  I mean, as you opened with, Putin is already negotiating with minerals on Russian-occupied [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=308.94000000000005s)]
*  land. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=313.78000000000003s)]
*  So the private sector is kind of stepping back and saying, how do we know there's not [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=314.78000000000003s)]
*  more land that he's going to occupy and try to negotiate minerals with? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=318.64000000000004s)]
*  So there's already this counter-presence of negotiating with minerals on occupied land. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=322.86s)]
*  Graceland Basquenanda, I don't think you could have had a better guess to help us understand [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=326.86s)]
*  this or actually pull back some of the curtains on what may have been agreed to. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=329.70000000000005s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=333.68s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=334.68s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A8P3sXdDU&t=335.68s)]
