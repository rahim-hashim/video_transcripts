# Trump signs executive order on IVF, takes questions on Ukraine and more
**CBS News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo)
*  I want to take you now to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, where President Trump is speaking. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=0.0s)]
*  It's very important to state that incredible things are happening in our country. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=10.72s)]
*  I think we've made more progress in three weeks than they've made in four years, especially [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  with respect to the reputation of our country. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=20.6s)]
*  And people are respecting us again as a country and as a powerful country and maybe a smart [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=24.2s)]
*  country but maybe not so smart because when you look at some of the waste, fraud and abuse [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=29.76s)]
*  that's being uncovered by Doge and the people at Doge, these are young, often young, but [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=35.04s)]
*  super brilliant people, incredible computer scientists and other things. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=42.34s)]
*  And they're finding levels of fraud and waste and abuse like I think nobody ever thought [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=47.84s)]
*  possible. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=55.68000000000001s)]
*  But before we do that, I just want to ask Will to come over. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=57.6s)]
*  I've just finished signing some executive orders and if we could start with that, Will, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=62.24s)]
*  you might want to come up here and just explain what we did. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=66.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=69.8s)]
*  Good afternoon, y'all. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=70.8s)]
*  A short while ago, President Trump signed three items. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=73.68s)]
*  The first is an executive order relating to the affordability and availability of in vitro [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=79.08s)]
*  fertilization and other fertility treatments. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=83.72s)]
*  These are treatments that have become unaffordable for many Americans or have been unaffordable [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=87.0s)]
*  for many Americans. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=91.8s)]
*  And the executive order is a directive to the Domestic Policy Council to examine ways [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=93.16s)]
*  to make IVF and other fertility treatments more affordable for more Americans. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  The second item that we signed was a presidential memorandum imposing radical transparency requirements [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=103.2s)]
*  on government departments and agencies in keeping with President Trump and the administration's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=109.36s)]
*  broader commitment to governmental transparency. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=114.36s)]
*  What this presidential memorandum would do is require as waste, fraud, and abuse is uncovered, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=117.24s)]
*  as programs are canceled, and ultimately as taxpayer dollars are saved, this presidential [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=123.72s)]
*  memorandum would require departments and agencies to make all of the details of that freely [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=129.56s)]
*  available to the public. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=134.84s)]
*  Lastly, we have another executive order that President Trump signed relating to independent [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=136.76s)]
*  agencies. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=142.32s)]
*  This executive order would establish important oversight functions in the Office of Management [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=143.64s)]
*  and Budget and its subsidiary office, OIRA, supervising independent agencies and many [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=148.44s)]
*  of their actions, and also reestablishes the long-standing norm that only the president [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=154.0s)]
*  or the attorney general can speak for the United States when stating an opinion as to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=159.67999999999998s)]
*  what the law is. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=164.48s)]
*  Thank you very much, Will. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  That was the primary purpose of this conference, to explain that they are all very important [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=169.08s)]
*  in their own way. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=174.68s)]
*  Fertilization, I've been saying that we're going to do what we have to do, and I think [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  the women and families, husbands, are very appreciative of it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=181.84s)]
*  But that was it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=187.18s)]
*  I do want to say while I'm up here, I've been contacted by some of the biggest companies [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=188.18s)]
*  in the world, and because of what we're doing economically and through tariffs and taxes [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=192.16000000000003s)]
*  and incentives, they want to come back into the United States, and we'll be announcing [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  various very large companies, the biggest actually, and they'll be coming back, having [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  to do with chips and having to do also with cars and lots of other things. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=207.67999999999998s)]
*  We're going to be announcing some very, very big, very big momentous, I think momentous [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=213.32s)]
*  decisions are being made by companies all around the world, the biggest, and they want [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=220.23999999999998s)]
*  to come back into the U.S. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=224.85999999999999s)]
*  Car plants are being canceled in other locations now because they want to build them here, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=227.29999999999998s)]
*  and you read about a couple, not that I want to mention names or anything, but you read [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=232.18s)]
*  about a couple of big ones in Mexico just got canceled because they're going to be building [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=235.34s)]
*  them in the United States, and that's very simply because of what we're doing with respect [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=239.45999999999998s)]
*  to taxes, tariffs, and incentives. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=243.06s)]
*  And I think it's a very important thing, and you'll be seeing this over the next, probably [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=246.14s)]
*  two years, to be honest, but you're going to see a lot of it over the next couple of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=252.76s)]
*  weeks, a lot of big ones are going to be announcing. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  And so while we're here, I guess we can take a couple of quick questions. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  Please. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  Mr. President, have you decided specifically what the auto tariff rate should be? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I probably will tell you that on April 2nd, but it'll be in the neighborhood of 25%. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=269.52s)]
*  More on study conductors and pharmaceuticals? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=276.52s)]
*  It'll be 25% and higher, and it'll go very substantially higher over the course of a [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=279.20000000000005s)]
*  year, but we want to give them time to come in because, as you know, when they come into [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=283.92s)]
*  the United States and they have their plant or factory here, there is no tariff. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=287.92s)]
*  So we want to give them a little bit of a chance. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=293.32000000000005s)]
*  Yes, thank you. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  The EU, sorry, Andrea Shalall, the EU representative is going to be here in Washington next week, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm sorry, tomorrow. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  He's going to be meeting with Hassett and Greer and Letnik. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  What can the EU do to sort of avoid the reciprocal tariffs that you've talked about? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=310.08s)]
*  And, you know, you've talked a lot about the VAT. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=315.08s)]
*  Do you expect them to reduce that? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=318.24s)]
*  Well, they did already, as I understand it, reduce their car tariff all the way down to [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=320.48s)]
*  what we have. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=325.52s)]
*  And a lot of that will take place, and I think some won't do it and some will do it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=326.52s)]
*  But the EU had a 10% tax on cars, and now they have a 2.5% tax, which is the exact same [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=330.08s)]
*  as us. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=335.6s)]
*  So already we've saved a tremendous amount. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=336.6s)]
*  That would be great. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=338.67999999999995s)]
*  If everybody would do that, then we'd all be on the same playing field. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=339.67999999999995s)]
*  Because essentially what we're doing with the tariffs is, you know, they charge us, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=343.08s)]
*  we charge them, same amount. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=346.96s)]
*  And it's called reciprocal, actually. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=349.32s)]
*  And whatever they charge us, we're charging them. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=352.91999999999996s)]
*  And so the EU is, you know, I appreciate that they did this, but, you know, the EU has been [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=355.34s)]
*  very unfair to us. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=360.12s)]
*  We have a deficit of $350 billion. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=361.15999999999997s)]
*  They don't take our cars. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=363.79999999999995s)]
*  They don't take our farm products. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=365.52s)]
*  They don't take almost anything. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=367.52s)]
*  They take very little. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=369.14s)]
*  And we're going to have to straighten that out. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=371.06s)]
*  And we will. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=372.62s)]
*  I have no doubt about it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=373.62s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead, please. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=374.62s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=375.62s)]
*  Can you tell us a little bit more about the Russia talks? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=376.62s)]
*  Your impression of how they went today and if you're perhaps more confident or less confident [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=382.02s)]
*  of a deal after what happened today? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=385.78s)]
*  Well, much more confident. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=387.65999999999997s)]
*  They were very good. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=389.06s)]
*  Russia wants to do something. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=391.26s)]
*  They want to stop the savage barbarianism. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=392.41999999999996s)]
*  I mean, what's going on over there? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=396.66s)]
*  It's soldiers are being killed by the thousands on a weekly basis. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=399.14000000000004s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=403.38000000000005s)]
*  And they're not American soldiers. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=405.22s)]
*  They're Russian soldiers and they're Ukrainian soldiers, largely, although a lot of Koreans [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=406.70000000000005s)]
*  have been killed, as you know. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=411.54s)]
*  Quite a bit of them have been killed. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=414.14000000000004s)]
*  They came over to fight and a large portion have been wiped out. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=415.54s)]
*  But we want to end it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=419.66s)]
*  It's a senseless war. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=421.5s)]
*  It should have never happened. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=423.18s)]
*  It would have never happened if I was president. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=424.7s)]
*  And it's a shame to see it. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=426.74s)]
*  And I see pictures that you don't see, but I see pictures of fields that look just horrible. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=427.94s)]
*  Looks like Gettysburg. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=432.90000000000003s)]
*  If you see the old pictures of Gettysburg, it's soldiers lying all over the field, body [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=433.90000000000003s)]
*  parts all over the field. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=438.06s)]
*  They're all dead. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=439.3s)]
*  And this is going on on a daily basis. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=440.9s)]
*  It's a horrible thing. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=443.9s)]
*  Both Russia and Ukraine, they're losing thousands and thousands of soldiers. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=444.94s)]
*  And a lot of people have been killed, too. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=449.5s)]
*  I think that's one of the things that you'll see historically and you'll see later on as [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=451.42s)]
*  it goes along. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=456.1s)]
*  I think people are going to be surprised at how many people, not only soldiers, have been [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=457.18s)]
*  killed in Ukraine. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=461.22s)]
*  A lot more people than you think. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=463.22s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=465.14s)]
*  President Trump, as part of a peace deal with Putin, would you be willing to consider removing [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=468.14s)]
*  all American troops from Europe? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=474.0s)]
*  Well, nobody's asked me to do that, so I don't think we'd have to do that. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=476.62s)]
*  I wouldn't want to do that. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=481.18s)]
*  But that question's never really come up. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=482.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=485.94s)]
*  Please. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=486.94s)]
*  Sir, do you support stationing European peacekeeping troops in Ukraine as part of this peace deal? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=487.94s)]
*  If they want to do that, that's great. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=495.78000000000003s)]
*  I'm all for it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=497.38s)]
*  If they want to do that, I think that'd be fine. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=498.38s)]
*  I mean, I know France has mentioned it. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=502.46000000000004s)]
*  Others have mentioned it. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=504.42s)]
*  UK has mentioned it. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=505.7s)]
*  But yeah, well, if we have a peace deal, I think having troops over there from the standpoint [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=508.26s)]
*  of Europe, we won't have to put any over there because, you know, we're very far away. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=513.66s)]
*  But having troops over there would be fine. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=518.9s)]
*  I would not object to it at all. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=521.06s)]
*  We're talking about this now. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=522.74s)]
*  Peace. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=524.34s)]
*  We have either a ceasefire or a peace itself, and we're looking to do both. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=525.34s)]
*  We'd start off with a ceasefire. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=530.5s)]
*  And if they want to do that. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=532.9s)]
*  I know France was willing to do that, and I thought that was a beautiful gesture. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=534.46s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=538.58s)]
*  Sir, do you have any message for Ukrainians who, after three years of fighting, might [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=539.58s)]
*  feel betrayed or disappointed at not having a seat at these initial talks in Saudi Arabia? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=543.4200000000001s)]
*  Well, I think I'm really disappointed in what's happened. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=547.98s)]
*  I've been watching this for three years. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=553.34s)]
*  It's a war that would have never happened if I was president. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=555.0600000000001s)]
*  And I've been watching these, you know, people being killed at levels that you've rarely [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=557.58s)]
*  seen, not even close, since the Second World War. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=564.3s)]
*  And I'm very disappointed. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=567.74s)]
*  I hear that, you know, they're upset about not having a seat. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=568.74s)]
*  Well, they've had a seat for three years, and a long time before that. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=571.42s)]
*  This could have been settled very easily. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=575.18s)]
*  Just a half-baked negotiator could have settled this years ago without, I think, without the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=577.1s)]
*  loss of much land, very little land, without the loss of any lives, and without the loss [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=586.3s)]
*  of cities that are just laying on their side. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=592.1600000000001s)]
*  You have those magnificent golden domes that are shattered, will never be replaced. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=594.72s)]
*  You can't replace them. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=600.5600000000001s)]
*  Thousand-year-old domes that are so beautiful. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=602.08s)]
*  You can't replace that. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=604.72s)]
*  The whole civilization has changed because of what's so- When they're worried about not [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=606.32s)]
*  being seated, you mean somebody that should have gone in and made a deal a long time ago? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=610.48s)]
*  You could have made a deal. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=616.48s)]
*  This is one that could have made a deal. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=617.36s)]
*  There was no talk of this during the Trump administration. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=618.88s)]
*  Putin would have never, ever done it. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=621.84s)]
*  And by the way, we wouldn't have had October 7th. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=624.32s)]
*  You know that? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=627.52s)]
*  We wouldn't have had October 7th either in Israel, and we wouldn't have that mess that's [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=628.1600000000001s)]
*  going on over there. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=632.5600000000001s)]
*  It's like we have great fire people here. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=633.44s)]
*  We're putting out fires. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=636.32s)]
*  All over the world, we're putting out fires. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=638.0s)]
*  So that wouldn't have happened. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=640.5600000000001s)]
*  And you know what else wouldn't have happened? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=641.6800000000001s)]
*  Inflation. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=643.12s)]
*  Because it was caused really by the cost of energy going through the roof because of [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=644.4s)]
*  their bad energy policies and also their spending, their terrible spending, wasteful [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=648.24s)]
*  spending on the Green New Scam. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=653.84s)]
*  It's a scam. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=655.44s)]
*  It's a whole big scam. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=656.16s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=657.2s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=658.5600000000001s)]
*  I want to ask you a little closer to home. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=659.04s)]
*  What would it take for you to reconsider the restrictions on the Associated Press? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=661.52s)]
*  And secondly, some of your advisors are concerned with the Associated Press's style guide, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=666.32s)]
*  using language and giving guidance to not use words like illegal immigrant [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=671.84s)]
*  or to use phrases like gender affirming care. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=677.12s)]
*  And they're concerned about that being an encroaching amount of liberalism [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=679.68s)]
*  in the way in which the press writes about things. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=683.92s)]
*  Do you share those concerns? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=685.6s)]
*  Well, I do think that some of the phrases that they want to use are ridiculous. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=687.12s)]
*  And I think, frankly, they become obsolete, especially in the last three weeks, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=692.24s)]
*  because many things have happened in the last three weeks. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=696.96s)]
*  And I didn't know about that, but I would say that if they want to use certain phrases like that, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=699.36s)]
*  and I guess some are OK, but many aren't, but the Associated Press just refuses to [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=705.2s)]
*  go with what the law is and what is taking place. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=710.96s)]
*  It's called the Gulf of America now. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=714.48s)]
*  It's not called the Gulf of Mexico any longer. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=717.2800000000001s)]
*  I have the right to do it, just like we have the right to do Mount McKinley. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=719.9200000000001s)]
*  And nobody's even challenging that. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=722.88s)]
*  But only the Associated Press. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=725.0400000000001s)]
*  Essentially, it's primarily the Associated Press. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=726.4000000000001s)]
*  And I don't know what they're doing, but I just say that we're going to keep them out [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=728.96s)]
*  until such time as they agree that it's the Gulf of America. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=732.16s)]
*  We're very proud of this country, and we want it to be the Gulf of America. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=735.04s)]
*  Now, the Associated Press, as you know, has been very, very wrong on the election, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=738.48s)]
*  on Trump and the treatment of Trump and other things having to do with Trump and Republicans [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=745.6s)]
*  and conservatives, and they're doing us no favors. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=750.3199999999999s)]
*  And I guess I'm not doing them any favors. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=753.8399999999999s)]
*  That's the way life works. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=755.68s)]
*  But, you know, thank you for the question. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=756.72s)]
*  Who are you with? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=758.3199999999999s)]
*  Very good question. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=760.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=762.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=763.28s)]
*  We're hearing that Russia wants to force Ukraine to hold new elections [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=766.4s)]
*  in order to sign any kind of a peace deal. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=770.3199999999999s)]
*  Is that something that the U.S. would ever support? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=772.24s)]
*  Well, we have a situation where we haven't had elections in Ukraine. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=775.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, we have martial law, essentially martial law in Ukraine, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=781.76s)]
*  where the leader in Ukraine, I mean, I hate to say it, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=786.3199999999999s)]
*  but he's down at 4 percent approval rating. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=788.9599999999999s)]
*  And where a country has been blown to smithereens, you got [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=792.4s)]
*  most of the cities are laying on their sides. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=796.3199999999999s)]
*  The buildings are collapsed. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=799.4399999999999s)]
*  It looks like a massive demolition site. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=800.56s)]
*  The whole, I mean, so many of the cities, I mean, they haven't done it in Kiev [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=804.0s)]
*  because I guess they don't want to shoot too many rockets in there. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=807.8399999999999s)]
*  They've done it 20 percent, but they haven't done it 100 percent. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=810.4s)]
*  If they wanted to do it 100 percent, it would probably happen very quickly. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=813.92s)]
*  But you have cities that are absolutely decimated. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=817.12s)]
*  And yeah, I would say that, you know, when they want to seat at the table, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=821.28s)]
*  you could say the people have to — wouldn't the people of Ukraine have to say, like, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=824.8s)]
*  you know, it's been a long time since we've had an election? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=829.36s)]
*  That's not a Russia thing. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=832.0s)]
*  That's something coming from me and coming from many other countries also. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=833.28s)]
*  You know, Ukraine is being just wiped out. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=838.88s)]
*  Look at what's happening to the cities. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=842.3199999999999s)]
*  There are cities — there's not even a building standing. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=844.72s)]
*  It's a massive — you talk about Gaza. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=846.88s)]
*  I mean, it's — literally, these cities look like Gaza. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=850.4s)]
*  Actually, many have percentage-wise more buildings knocked down than in Gaza. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=854.64s)]
*  So, you know, people are tired of it. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=860.16s)]
*  People want to see something happen. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=862.48s)]
*  And, you know, the other thing that — it's been bothering me for a long time [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=864.72s)]
*  because I solved the problem with NATO. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=868.8s)]
*  They paid hundreds of billions of dollars into the funds of NATO [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=870.8s)]
*  when I said you got to pay because the United States was paying for European countries, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=874.56s)]
*  and then they take advantage of us on trade. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=879.2s)]
*  But I've seen it. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=881.76s)]
*  Look, we have to — they have to pay. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=883.12s)]
*  They have to find out where is the money going to. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=885.44s)]
*  We have — I believe President Zelensky said last week [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=888.08s)]
*  that he doesn't know where half of the money is that we gave him. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=892.24s)]
*  Well, we gave them, I believe, $350 billion. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=894.72s)]
*  But let's say it's something less than that, but it's a lot. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=898.32s)]
*  And we have to equalize with Europe because Europe has given us a — [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=901.84s)]
*  given a very much smaller percentage than that. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=906.32s)]
*  I think Europe has given $100 billion, and we've given, let's say, $300 plus. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=908.72s)]
*  And it's more important for them than it is for us. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=915.12s)]
*  We have an ocean in between, and they don't. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=918.1600000000001s)]
*  But where is all the money that's been given? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=921.2s)]
*  Where is it going? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=924.0s)]
*  And nobody — I've never seen an accounting of it. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=924.96s)]
*  We give hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=927.36s)]
*  I have — I don't see any accounting. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=930.24s)]
*  So I want a sea piece. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=932.1600000000001s)]
*  Look, you know why I want? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=934.0s)]
*  Because I don't want all these people killed anymore. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=936.08s)]
*  I'm looking at people that are being killed. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=938.8000000000001s)]
*  And they're Russian and Ukrainian people, but they're people. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=941.44s)]
*  Doesn't matter where they're from on the whole planet. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=944.32s)]
*  And I think I have the power to end this war. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=948.08s)]
*  And I think it's going very well. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=950.8000000000001s)]
*  But today I heard, oh, well, we weren't invited. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=952.72s)]
*  Well, you've been there for three years. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=954.64s)]
*  You should have ended it three years. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=956.0s)]
*  You should have never started it. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=957.76s)]
*  You could have made a deal. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=958.96s)]
*  I could have made a deal for Ukraine that would have given them almost all of the land — [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=960.4s)]
*  everything — almost all of the land. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=966.32s)]
*  And no people would have been killed, and no city would have been demolished, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=968.08s)]
*  and not one dome would have been knocked down. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=970.96s)]
*  But they chose not to do it that way. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=973.6s)]
*  And President Biden, in all fairness — he doesn't have a clue. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=975.6800000000001s)]
*  He was so bad for this. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=979.2800000000001s)]
*  He was so bad. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=980.72s)]
*  So pathetic. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=981.44s)]
*  So sad. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=982.8000000000001s)]
*  But with all of that being said, look, it is what it is. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=984.4000000000001s)]
*  When I left, there was no chance that this could have happened. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=988.0s)]
*  But it happened because we had incompetent leadership at many different levels. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=990.24s)]
*  But when you see what's taking place in Ukraine with millions of people killed, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=994.48s)]
*  including the soldiers — millions of people killed — [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=999.52s)]
*  a big percentage of their cities knocked down to the ground. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1002.56s)]
*  I don't know how anybody even lives there. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1005.6s)]
*  You know, when they say they took a poll, and Zelensky is at 4 percent. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1007.12s)]
*  Who's living there? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1010.96s)]
*  You know, I mean, people are — it's hard to believe that people live there. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1011.84s)]
*  Their cities are being knocked down. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1015.04s)]
*  And this is something that would have never happened. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1018.0s)]
*  And, by the way, for four years, it didn't happen. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1020.16s)]
*  It was never going to happen. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1023.2s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1024.16s)]
*  I have one follow-up question. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1024.66s)]
*  How would you counter the perception — because Russia is pushing for this, obviously. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1026.0s)]
*  They don't really hold true elections — that that would be a capitulation of some sort. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1030.16s)]
*  How would you guard against potentially Russia installing a puppet government? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1033.92s)]
*  And then, finally, how would that new election have an impact on getting [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1038.0s)]
*  Zelensky to sign the rare earth minerals deal? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1042.0800000000002s)]
*  Look, you have leadership. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1045.44s)]
*  And I like him personally. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1048.0s)]
*  He's fine. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1049.68s)]
*  But I don't care about personally. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1051.2800000000002s)]
*  I care about getting the job done. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1053.6000000000001s)]
*  You have leadership now that's allowed a war to go on that should have never even happened, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1055.68s)]
*  even without the United States. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1059.92s)]
*  Look, we had a president who was grossly incompetent. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1061.44s)]
*  He had no idea what he was doing. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1065.52s)]
*  He said some very stupid things, like going in for portions and all of those things. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1066.96s)]
*  He made a lot of bad statements. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1070.72s)]
*  But he's grossly incompetent. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1072.0800000000002s)]
*  And I think everyone knew that. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1075.1200000000001s)]
*  This is something that should have never happened, would have never happened. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1077.0400000000002s)]
*  And I used to discuss it with Putin. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1080.0s)]
*  President Putin and I would talk about Ukraine. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1082.56s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye, I will tell you that. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1084.96s)]
*  But he never — there was never a chance of him going in. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1087.04s)]
*  And I told him, you better not go in. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1089.36s)]
*  Don't go in. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1091.04s)]
*  Don't go in. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1092.24s)]
*  And he understood that. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1093.28s)]
*  He understood it fully. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1094.4s)]
*  But I'm only interested — I want to see if I can save maybe millions of lives. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1096.32s)]
*  This could even end up in a World War III. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1101.04s)]
*  I mean, to be honest with you, you've been hearing now Europe is saying, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1103.04s)]
*  well, I think we're going to go in, and we're going to go — [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1105.28s)]
*  all of a sudden, you're going to end up in World War III. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1107.04s)]
*  Over something that should have never happened. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1110.08s)]
*  And, you know, it's a very sad situation. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1112.88s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1115.12s)]
*  Q In a court filing, the White House said that Elon Musk is not a Doge employee [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1115.62s)]
*  and has no authority to make decisions. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1122.64s)]
*  Can you clarify for us — [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1124.96s)]
*  THE PRESIDENT Well, Elon Musk — [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1126.4s)]
*  Q — what his federal is there? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1128.24s)]
*  THE PRESIDENT Yeah, yeah. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1129.44s)]
*  Elon is, to me, a patriot. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1130.56s)]
*  So, you know, you could call him an employee. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1133.04s)]
*  You could call him a consultant. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1134.88s)]
*  You could call him whatever you want. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1136.16s)]
*  But he's a patriot. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1138.08s)]
*  I mean, look at the kind of things — [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1138.96s)]
*  I just said — just write it down, just in case that question got asked, right? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1140.24s)]
*  And — which I'm surprised it took so long, actually. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1144.4s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1147.68s)]
*  Ukraine's a bigger deal because people are dying by the thousands a week. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1148.88s)]
*  Thousands. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1153.8400000000001s)]
*  But look at this. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1155.52s)]
*  From 90 to 99, Social Security — 6,054,000 people. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1156.32s)]
*  Well, that's okay. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1163.1200000000001s)]
*  Maybe that's possible. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1164.0s)]
*  You know, 90 to 90 — 99. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1165.1200000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's possible. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1168.48s)]
*  That's a lot of people, though, with that. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1169.52s)]
*  But people that live to 100 to 109 — 4,734,000. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1171.68s)]
*  Wow, that's a lot. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1176.8s)]
*  That means over 100 years old, they're 4 million people. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1178.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1180.88s)]
*  I don't know too many. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1181.6s)]
*  I know people that are doing great in their 90s, but not too many people over 100. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1182.48s)]
*  But over 120 — from 120 years old, people that are 120 years old, up to 129 — [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1186.72s)]
*  3,472,000 people. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1197.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1200.72s)]
*  You know, that can't possibly be because the record is like — [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1201.68s)]
*  I think it's one person — a woman — lived to 127, but they have 3,472. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1205.2s)]
*  Okay, but now we're going really in. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1211.36s)]
*  People from 130 years old to 139-year-old. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1213.76s)]
*  3,936,000. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1218.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1222.24s)]
*  I wonder if people are getting paid with all this. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1223.28s)]
*  I mean, are these checks — and that's what we're checking right now. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1225.28s)]
*  People from 140 years old to 149 years old. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1229.2s)]

*  People from 150 years old to 159 years old. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1245.76s)]

*  By the way, these are in the computer files. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1256.0s)]
*  This is what they do well. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1258.0s)]
*  They're super — I asked Elon, who are these Doge people? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1260.32s)]
*  He said they're super brilliant computer people, and they love the country. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1264.3999999999999s)]

*  Somebody got $520 million for an environmental — sounds like an environmental study. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1359.68s)]
*  I've always been one that paid a lot of money for my environmental studies, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1365.28s)]
*  but I paid like $50,000, not $520 million. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1369.28s)]

*  What about, like, voter turnout here? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1521.2s)]
*  We've done that, I guess. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1523.28s)]

*  orders, two executive orders, and one presidential memorandum this [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1584.72s)]
*  afternoon at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1587.44s)]
*  One of them focused on expanding access to in vitro fertilization. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1589.28s)]
*  And another advocating within the executive branch something called [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1593.8400000000001s)]
*  radical transparency for government agencies. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1597.92s)]

*  This was in the Office of Management and Budget and other executive branch [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1612.08s)]
*  agency. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1615.36s)]
*  The president took several questions. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1615.76s)]
*  Let me summarize the two biggest headline grabbing issues raised. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1617.52s)]
*  The president talked about his very fervent desire to establish peace [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1622.32s)]
*  between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1626.24s)]
*  But any Ukrainian or European dissecting his remarks would hear no [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1628.08s)]
*  discouraging words for Russia or Vladimir Putin about precipitating [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1634.08s)]
*  this war, invading Ukraine, and applying several times that it was the [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1638.96s)]
*  fault of Ukraine for not settling this before the invasion occurred nearly [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1644.8s)]
*  three years ago. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1649.3600000000001s)]
*  That will be deeply disturbing to those in Ukraine trying to deal with the [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1650.8s)]
*  Russian invasion in many different ways and for Europeans continuing to [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1657.04s)]
*  support Ukraine and wondering about what the direction ultimately will be [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1660.72s)]
*  of peace talks that the Trump administration has set in motion with [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1664.64s)]
*  Russia. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1667.92s)]
*  There was also a reference to elements of waste found by the Department of [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1668.56s)]
*  Government Efficiency, led at least in title, if not in exact executive branch [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1674.0s)]
*  terminology by Elon Musk. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1681.36s)]
*  The president made a reference, and I'm sure this will get digested across the [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1683.12s)]
*  country, of people receiving Social Security benefits who are 120 years old, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1686.32s)]
*  130 years old. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1691.12s)]
*  That is in all likelihood not true. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1693.6s)]
*  Why? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1697.28s)]
*  Because we know that the underlying computer language model at Social [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1698.08s)]
*  Security Administration, something called COBOL, if anyone took computer [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1703.12s)]
*  science 40 years ago in college, you'd know that. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1707.12s)]
*  It's an outdated system. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1709.84s)]
*  It doesn't have precise dating mechanisms. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1711.2s)]
*  And in 2023, the Inspector General to Social Security Administration did a [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1713.84s)]
*  report that said 99% of those on the list who appear to be 120, 130 or [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1719.28s)]
*  something other age larger than that, are not receiving any Social Security [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1725.36s)]
*  benefits at all, though it might appear that they are. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1731.04s)]
*  Those are just two of the biggest things that came out of this press conference. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1734.9599999999998s)]
*  We'll continue to monitor it, but I want to bring in CBS News Chief White [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1737.52s)]
*  House correspondent Nancy Cordes, who is in West Palm Beach, to talk about other [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1740.9599999999998s)]
*  developments from this press conference. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1744.9599999999998s)]
*  Nancy? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1746.4799999999998s)]
*  Major, the executive orders that President Trump announced and signed were [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1749.76s)]
*  all interesting for various reasons. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1755.12s)]
*  Let's take the IVF one first. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1757.36s)]
*  This was a campaign promise of his. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1759.52s)]
*  After Roe v. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1762.08s)]
*  Wade was struck down a couple of years ago, there was some thinking by [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1763.52s)]
*  Republicans that that made them particularly vulnerable on the issue of IVF, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1767.6s)]
*  because there were some conservatives arguing that now that states had the [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1773.12s)]
*  to roll back abortion protections, that perhaps they could roll back IVF [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1779.0400000000002s)]
*  provisions as well, because they viewed it as akin to abortion. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1785.92s)]
*  There were other Republicans who felt just the opposite, who said that no IVF was a [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1791.76s)]
*  path to creating life. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1798.16s)]
*  And so the way that President Trump dealt with this on the campaign trail was to [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1799.8400000000001s)]
*  first claim that he himself was actually the father of IVF, which raised some [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1805.04s)]
*  eyebrows, but then to say that once he was president, he was going to do [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1809.28s)]
*  something to lower the cost of IVF, which we know can rise into the tens of [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1812.88s)]
*  thousands, if not $100,000 per couple, which is something that most people can't [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1820.32s)]
*  afford. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1824.64s)]
*  So the announcement he made today doesn't actually immediately lower the [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1825.1200000000001s)]
*  price of IVF, because that can only be done with the help of insurance [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1830.08s)]
*  companies, but it essentially tasks the government with figuring out ways to [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1834.24s)]
*  make IVF and other fertility treatments less expensive. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1839.12s)]
*  The transparency executive order, not that surprising. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1843.12s)]
*  He's been talking a lot about transparency. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1846.96s)]
*  Basically, it requires government agencies, as they're making these cuts, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1848.8799999999999s)]
*  to announce what they're doing and why they're doing it. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1853.6799999999998s)]
*  That would be welcome, because up until now, we've had a lot of trouble getting [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1857.28s)]
*  information about, for example, how many jobs are being cut across agencies. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1860.3999999999999s)]
*  But the third executive order was really interesting, Major, and I think a [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1865.9199999999998s)]
*  lawyer would need to tell us whether it's actually legal or not, because what [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1871.12s)]
*  it does is rein in independent agencies. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1875.36s)]
*  For the laymen, there are plenty of federal agencies that come under the [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1880.0s)]
*  direct purview of the president of the United States. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1883.52s)]
*  Think of the Pentagon, the State Department, the Energy Department. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1886.6399999999999s)]
*  He can name who heads those agencies. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1891.04s)]
*  He can fire who heads those agencies. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1892.8799999999999s)]
*  The chain of command goes all the way up to the top, and that's him. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1894.8799999999999s)]
*  But there are a lot of agencies that are considered independent. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1897.92s)]
*  The Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1901.52s)]
*  the Federal Election Commission, and while he has the power to name some of [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1906.24s)]
*  the commissioners, he doesn't have the power to fire them if they don't do [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1913.2s)]
*  what he wants. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1917.3600000000001s)]
*  Think back, for example, to the Biden administration. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1918.96s)]
*  He desperately wanted to get rid of the postmaster, Louis DeJoy, because he was [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1922.24s)]
*  somebody who had been put in place by Donald Trump in his first term. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1928.16s)]
*  Biden didn't agree with DeJoy, but he could not remove him. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1933.04s)]
*  And basically, what this executive order calls for is placing these independent [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1936.8s)]
*  agencies like the Federal Trade Commission, the FCC, the SEC back under [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1942.32s)]
*  the purview of OMB and the president of the United States. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1948.8s)]
*  And it's just not clear to me whether statute actually allows that. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1953.9199999999998s)]
*  So it's possible that this could lead to yet another lawsuit like so many others [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1958.1599999999999s)]
*  that we've been watching unfold throughout the country. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1962.96s)]
*  And Nancy, I'm so glad you brought that third one up, because that question, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1965.4399999999998s)]
*  what is the independence of these independent agencies, is being litigated [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1969.2s)]
*  in federal courts right now. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1973.52s)]
*  And if the announcement that preceded President Trump coming to the microphones [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1975.92s)]
*  from one of his top White House officials saying that under this executive order, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1979.8400000000001s)]
*  it asserts that only the president and the attorney general can state the [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1984.24s)]
*  consensus or policy of any independent agency, that's not the intent of Congress [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1987.92s)]
*  for the creation of those independent agencies. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1992.32s)]
*  And it's not been the historical orientation to the federal courts about [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1994.64s)]
*  their status in relationship to the executive branch. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=1998.48s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi Exactly. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2001.68s)]
*  And there's a reason that many of these agencies were created to be quasi-independent. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2004.16s)]
*  Think, for example, of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which investigates [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2010.32s)]
*  large companies and corporate malfeasance. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2015.52s)]
*  You wouldn't necessarily want the president of the United States to be able to [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2018.4s)]
*  go ahead and fire the head of the SEC if the SEC goes and investigates a company [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2023.2s)]
*  that the president likes. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2032.3999999999999s)]
*  The Federal Communications Commission makes major decisions about the way that spectrum [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2034.6399999999999s)]
*  is handed out in this country. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2041.28s)]
*  You wouldn't want the president of the United States to be able to pressure the [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2043.52s)]
*  FCC commissioner to decide to give some spectrum, which is very valuable, to one [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2049.12s)]
*  of the president's friends or colleagues and threaten to fire them if they don't go along. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2056.16s)]
*  So that's the reason that these agencies were created to be independent. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2061.2s)]
*  It's unclear if the president of the United States, just by signing this executive order, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2066.88s)]
*  can change that. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2071.68s)]
*  John O'Brien And Nancy, the president himself said, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2072.3199999999997s)]
*  of the topics so far discussed today at his press conference, Ukraine was the biggest. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2074.96s)]
*  And he offered this assessment describing his level of confidence about the first talks [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2079.76s)]
*  between the U.S. delegation and the Russians in Saudi Arabia. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2085.2000000000003s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2088.5600000000004s)]
*  President Trump Well, much more confident. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2088.96s)]
*  They were very good. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2091.6000000000004s)]
*  Russia wants to do something. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2093.52s)]
*  They want to stop the savage barbarianism. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2094.88s)]
*  I mean, what's going on over there? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2099.2000000000003s)]
*  It's soldiers are being killed by the thousands on a weekly basis. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2101.52s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2105.84s)]
*  John O'Brien And Nancy, your ear was tuned to this. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2106.8s)]
*  So was mine. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2110.8s)]
*  Hard to find a single discouraging word from the president of the United States about Russia's [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2112.16s)]
*  culpability in the war in Ukraine. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2118.0s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi Right. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2120.32s)]
*  I mean, it's pretty clear who's responsible for the savage barbarianism, as he described it, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2122.56s)]
*  and that is Russia, which invaded Ukraine three years ago, unprovoked. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2127.68s)]
*  And yet the president of the United States multiple times in this event and in so many others [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2132.7999999999997s)]
*  refused to simply acknowledge that Russia was the initial and only aggressor and that Ukraine has [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2139.2799999999997s)]
*  simply been fighting to retain its sovereignty. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2147.52s)]
*  In fact, he lashed out at Ukraine far more than he did lash out at Russia in this [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2151.8399999999997s)]
*  Q&A. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2158.3199999999997s)]
*  He said that if the president of Ukraine knew what he was doing, he would have negotiated an [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2158.96s)]
*  end to the war a long time ago. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2166.3999999999996s)]
*  He wouldn't have allowed it to happen. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2168.24s)]
*  Unclear how Ukraine could have prevented Russia from invading it. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2170.08s)]
*  But it's part of a pattern where the president has pretty harsh words for the country that [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2175.8399999999997s)]
*  was attacked, but very few, if any, harsh words for the country that attacked them. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2183.52s)]
*  And that's semantics, but the issue behind it and what has so many European allies concerned [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2189.2s)]
*  and what certainly has the Ukrainians concerned is the fact that this is a reflection of how [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2196.96s)]
*  President Trump plans to go into these negotiations that he says he wants to happen right away to end [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2203.44s)]
*  the war. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2209.44s)]
*  Ukrainians feel he's already putting his thumb on the scale for the Russians and they worry [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2210.56s)]
*  about what that means for them. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2215.44s)]
*  And the president did raise some issues that many Americans who don't follow this day by day might [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2217.04s)]
*  be surprised about. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2222.0800000000004s)]
*  So they have martial law in Ukraine. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2222.8s)]
*  That's true. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2225.44s)]
*  It was imposed when the Russians invaded as a national security measure and there is a [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2226.2400000000002s)]
*  presidential election schedule for the spring suspended. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2232.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2234.88s)]
*  Because martial law precludes under Ukrainian law the conducting of a presidential election when [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2235.6s)]
*  your country has been invaded by another aggressor, which is what has happened. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2241.12s)]
*  So those things are true, but they're not necessarily the fault of the Ukrainians. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2245.04s)]
*  Again, the president seemed to imply that this either could have been averted by the Ukrainians [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2250.72s)]
*  or they're the ones principally to blame. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2257.04s)]
*  And that has to feel very good for Vladimir Putin, not just as a matter of what a [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2259.7599999999998s)]
*  president does or doesn't choose to emphasize, but as a backdrop for any conversations about [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2265.36s)]
*  the future of resolving this conflict. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2270.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2274.96s)]
*  I mean, the very fact, Major, that we got that tableau of the secretary of state sitting [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2275.2000000000003s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia across the table from his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, and we're [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2282.0s)]
*  told they met for about four and a half hours. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2289.36s)]
*  That is a scene that we have not witnessed in years because the Americans have, like so many [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2291.44s)]
*  other countries, basically cut off diplomatic engagement with Russia because of its invasion. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2298.88s)]
*  And in this meeting today, not only did they say that they were going to continue talking on a [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2305.6s)]
*  bilateral basis, but the secretary of state actually said that they want to increase their [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2311.68s)]
*  diplomatic cooperation and that they want the Russians to have more diplomats working in their [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2318.4s)]
*  embassy in Washington, D.C. They want to send more Americans to the U.S. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2326.2400000000002s)]
*  embassy in Moscow. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2330.6400000000003s)]
*  They want to increase economic cooperation with Russia and that if all goes well in these [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2332.0800000000004s)]
*  negotiations, that they want to lift the crippling sanctions that have been placed on Russia [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2340.2400000000002s)]
*  since the start of the invasion. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2344.6400000000003s)]
*  And, you know, it bears repeating how different this policy is from what we heard in the last [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2346.64s)]
*  administration and from what we're basically hearing from most U.S. allies around the world. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2354.88s)]
*  Now, Nancy, it's certainly possible that President Trump is softening up the rhetoric and maybe [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2360.48s)]
*  doing a head fake with the Russians and will drive a hard bargain on behalf of Ukrainian [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2365.84s)]
*  sovereignty, what's left of it after this invasion. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2371.12s)]
*  All of that is possible. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2373.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm not ruling that out. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2374.7999999999997s)]
*  But what you know and what I know is that the Russians care deeply about the way in which [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2376.16s)]
*  history, as they see it, is described. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2382.7999999999997s)]
*  And when they hear an American president sort of basically describe it their way, they feel, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2385.8399999999997s)]
*  and this has been proven out in all sorts of other negotiations, the Russians drive a hard [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2392.16s)]
*  bargain. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2396.56s)]
*  They always do. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2396.8799999999997s)]
*  They look out for their interests aggressively, very aggressively. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2397.7599999999998s)]
*  And in diplomatic encounters with presidents I've covered, they always want [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2401.12s)]
*  their side of the story established and agreed to, whether Americans agree with it or not. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2405.92s)]
*  And when a president like we've just seen, President Trump, more or less, orients himself [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2410.7200000000003s)]
*  for the Russian side of it, they feel, whether they've gained ground or not, that they have. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2416.08s)]
*  And in that context, I want to play this soundbite about a question the president was asked about [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2420.7200000000003s)]
*  whether or not it's justifiable for Ukrainians to feel disappointed about the U.S. approach [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2425.2000000000003s)]
*  to these peace talks. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2431.44s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2432.48s)]
*  Today I heard, oh, well, we weren't invited. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2433.6s)]
*  Well, you've been there for three years. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2435.36s)]
*  You should have ended it three years. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2436.7200000000003s)]
*  You should have never started it. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2438.48s)]
*  You could have made a deal. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2439.6800000000003s)]
*  I could have made a deal for Ukraine that would have given them almost all of the land, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2441.1200000000003s)]
*  everything, almost all of the land, and no people would have been killed and no city [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2447.04s)]
*  would have been demolished and not one dome would have been knocked down. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2450.7200000000003s)]
*  But they chose not to do it that way. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2454.32s)]
*  They chose the Ukrainians. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2458.0s)]
*  There we have it. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2460.96s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2461.6s)]
*  Hey, look, there are all kinds of ways to conduct a negotiation, right? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2463.8399999999997s)]
*  To your point, Major, it could be that the Trump administration has a strategy where [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2467.6s)]
*  they're going into these negotiations saying, hey, Russia, you're going to get a great deal here. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2472.56s)]
*  We're going to make sure it's really fair for you. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2477.12s)]
*  And then they drive a hard bargain and say, but look, we're, you know, look at how well [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2478.96s)]
*  we've done for you. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2483.8399999999997s)]
*  You should take this deal. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2484.56s)]
*  I think the reason that many U.S. allies are concerned that that is not actually the strategy [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2486.7200000000003s)]
*  is because of what President Trump has said about Russia and about Vladimir Putin, not [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2492.4s)]
*  just over the past year or two, but really over the past 10 years, in which he has routinely [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2498.1600000000003s)]
*  downplayed Russia's flaws, Russia's foreign policy when it is not in the U.S. interest. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2507.36s)]
*  And certainly in this case has focused on what he sees as Ukraine's culpability here. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2518.56s)]
*  But there is a degree to which the Trump team is simply saying the quiet part out loud. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2525.7599999999998s)]
*  Biden officials, though they felt it was not very helpful to say it publicly, they also [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2533.68s)]
*  believed that this invasion at the end of the day was only going to be wound down if [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2539.3599999999997s)]
*  there was some kind of negotiated settlement where the Ukrainians gave up some land. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2547.4399999999996s)]
*  And so the Trump officials say, look, you know, we're just saying what everybody already knows. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LA_mwgCZo&t=2551.8399999999997s)]
