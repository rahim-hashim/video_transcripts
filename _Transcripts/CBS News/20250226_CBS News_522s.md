# Trump says House budget plan will not cut Medicaid benefits
**CBS News:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38)
*  Back to Washington covering Congress [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=0.0s)]
*  and the president's push for what he [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=1.92s)]
*  calls the one big beautiful bill that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  budget bill adopted in the House after [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=7.0s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson and the president [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=9.36s)]
*  had to make some calls to Republican [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=11.28s)]
*  holdouts after canceling the vote. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  The House sent members home just to have [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=15.36s)]
*  them return around minutes later and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=17.88s)]
*  finish the job. So who held out only [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=19.88s)]
*  to get calls from the president? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=22.28s)]
*  Well, here they are in the end. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Everyone you see here switched positions, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  up for Congressman Thomas Massey [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=28.44s)]
*  from Kentucky there. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  He was the sole Republican [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  member to vote no. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=33.14s)]
*  Moments ago, President Trump got [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=34.52s)]
*  this question about what this bill [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=36.4s)]
*  means for your Medicare, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=38.64s)]
*  Medicaid and Social Security. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=40.2s)]
*  But it is spending bill that [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=41.32s)]
*  passed last night aims to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  cut $2 trillion. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=45.16s)]
*  Can you guarantee that Medicare, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=46.36s)]
*  Medicaid, Social Security will not be touched? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=48.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I have said it so many times [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=50.68000000000001s)]
*  you shouldn't be asking me that question. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=54.0s)]
*  OK, this will not be read my lips. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=57.4s)]
*  It won't be read my lips anymore. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=60.44s)]
*  We're not going to touch it now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  We are going to look for fraud. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=64.64s)]
*  I'm sure you're OK with that, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=66.64s)]
*  like people that shouldn't be on people [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=68.08s)]
*  that are illegal aliens and others, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=70.24s)]
*  criminals in many cases, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=73.12s)]
*  and that's with Social Security. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=75.56s)]
*  We have a lot of people. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=77.32s)]
*  You see that immediately when you see [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=78.08s)]
*  people that are 200 years old that are. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=79.6s)]
*  Being sent checks for Social Security. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=82.36s)]
*  Some of them are actually being sent checks, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=84.32s)]
*  so we're facing that down and I have a [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=86.16s)]
*  feeling that Pam is going to do a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=88.52s)]
*  very good job with that, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=89.92s)]
*  but you have a lot of fraud. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=91.36s)]
*  Alright, let's go live now. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=94.0s)]
*  CBS News congressional [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=94.88s)]
*  correspondent Caitlin Huey Burns. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=95.92s)]
*  Caitlin, great to be with you. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  The president says they're not [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=99.24s)]
*  going to touch Medicare Medicaid. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=100.44s)]
*  Is this the last we're going [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=102.56s)]
*  to hear about it though? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=103.4s)]
*  Probably not. What he has said today [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=106.88s)]
*  is something that he has been [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=109.84s)]
*  saying for weeks now that he doesn't [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=110.92s)]
*  want to touch these programs. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=112.64s)]
*  The thing is, the trick is that this [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=114.12s)]
*  bill that was passed by the House last night, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=116.76s)]
*  it does not mention Medicaid, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=119.16000000000001s)]
*  but what it does do is it directs [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=121.2s)]
*  the various committees across the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=123.88000000000001s)]
*  House that are dealing with spending [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  cuts to find savings and it especially. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=128.12s)]
*  Task the House Commerce Committee, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=131.56s)]
*  which oversees Medicaid, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=134.44s)]
*  Medicare and other programs to find [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=136.36s)]
*  over $800 million in spending. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=139.56s)]
*  So that's a lot of money. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=142.72s)]
*  That's a lot of cuts that they want to make, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  and that money has to come from somewhere. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=147.08s)]
*  So there have been proposals to at least [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=149.6s)]
*  look at Medicaid and other programs as well [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=152.6s)]
*  to see if there are ways to get those savings. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=156.76s)]
*  Now I asked speaker house, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=158.96s)]
*  I asked the Speaker of the House Johnson [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=160.4s)]
*  yesterday if he could unequivocally rule [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=162.52s)]
*  out that they won't touch Medicaid, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=165.28s)]
*  and he said what the president said today, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=167.0s)]
*  which is that we want to look [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=168.96s)]
*  at waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=170.4s)]
*  The question is. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=172.08s)]
*  If you tackle all of that, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=173.88000000000002s)]
*  does that equal $800 billion in [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  spending cuts and savings? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=178.04000000000002s)]
*  That remains an open question. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  The devil is in the details and you're [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=181.28s)]
*  going to see kind of this highlighted [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=184.0s)]
*  moving forward and I should note this [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  is going to be a long process. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=189.24s)]
*  What they passed yesterday was [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=191.8s)]
*  really just the start. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=193.72000000000003s)]
*  It's just a blueprint of framework [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=195.4s)]
*  now begins the really difficult [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=197.72000000000003s)]
*  work of actually putting in policy [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  and that also has to get a vote eventually too. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=202.08s)]
*  Yeah, speaking of that vote, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=204.8s)]
*  Speaker Johnson receiving praise [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=206.36s)]
*  from the president with this truth [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=207.96s)]
*  social post, but this wasn't an easy [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=209.6s)]
*  win to say the least. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  And now, as you mentioned, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=214.12s)]
*  we got to see what happens in the Senate. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=215.44s)]
*  Can we expect to fight? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=217.08s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=220.96s)]
*  I mean, before they can even get [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=221.68s)]
*  to any policy prescriptions here, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=223.08s)]
*  you're right, they have to meld it [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=225.08s)]
*  with the Senate version and they [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=226.8s)]
*  are two very different bills, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=228.56s)]
*  so they are going to have to work [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=230.48s)]
*  on getting something that they can agree to. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  I mean, one sticking point is wanting [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=235.6s)]
*  to extend the Trump tax cuts, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=237.6s)]
*  whether to make them permanent, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=241.6s)]
*  whether to make them temporary. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=243.0s)]
*  That's a sticking point among other things. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=245.72s)]
*  But looking at that House vote, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=248.04s)]
*  Republicans could only afford to lose [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=250.0s)]
*  one vote yesterday and they did. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=252.67999999999998s)]
*  The margins are just so narrow. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  Their majority is just so fragile. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=258.44s)]
*  So you can understand why we've seen [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=261.2s)]
*  the president issue executive order [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=263.92s)]
*  after executive order, you know, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=266.12s)]
*  working with Elon Musk to try to shrink [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=267.88s)]
*  the size of government. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=269.56s)]
*  You know, it's very difficult to get [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=271.2s)]
*  some of this stuff actually through Congress. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=272.76s)]
*  But a lot of the priorities that the president [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=275.8s)]
*  wants have to be funded by Congress. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=277.68s)]
*  So they have to pass something in order [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=280.32s)]
*  to fund what the president wants [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=282.44s)]
*  in terms of taxes, in terms of immigration, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=283.96s)]
*  in terms of military spending and so forth [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  that has to go through Congress. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=290.6s)]
*  The question is, can they all get on the same page? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=292.04s)]
*  And we know that there is no political incentive [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=293.88s)]
*  at all for Democrats to get on board with anything. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=296.44s)]
*  Yeah, and I want to lean more into those federal cuts, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  Kaylin, because we're talking about this [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=302.52s)]
*  from Capitol Hill while real people [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=304.2s)]
*  in the communities across the country [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=305.96000000000004s)]
*  are really starting to feel the impacts [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  of the president's positions. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=309.76s)]
*  And we're seeing reaction at these town halls. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=311.08s)]
*  I want to ask you about this town hall [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=313.36s)]
*  with the House GOP Vice Chair, Blake Moore from Utah. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=315.44s)]
*  He said this to federal workers, take a listen. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=319.56s)]
*  I know I have a very unique district. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=323.0s)]
*  It's a very, you know, a very strongly conservative district [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  but also a federal workforce district. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=327.48s)]
*  And right now those two are at odds [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=330.56s)]
*  because federal workers are kind of getting demonized [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=332.2s)]
*  out there in the social media sphere. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=334.64s)]
*  I remember saying at the town hall, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=337.24s)]
*  please don't pay attention to that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=338.88s)]
*  That's truly not the reality of what's going on [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=340.24s)]
*  but that's unfair to you to say that [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=342.88s)]
*  because, you know, like an email that you were told [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=345.92s)]
*  by maybe by your superior or somebody within the organization [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=349.44s)]
*  that you work for, hey, you don't have to respond [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=355.15999999999997s)]
*  to this five bullet point email. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=357.36s)]
*  Oh, actually you do or you shouldn't [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=358.64s)]
*  but on Twitter it looks on X, it looks like you should. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=360.8s)]
*  I get the frustration. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=364.32s)]
*  I've been very, very frustrated at this alongside you. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=365.32s)]
*  Yeah, this was interesting, Kaylin, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=368.8s)]
*  because Moore was addressing the confusion [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=370.16s)]
*  over Elon Musk's email heard of course around the world. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=372.16s)]
*  And now this is notable on Doge considering [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  Moore's leadership position and the fact [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=378.56s)]
*  he's in a very red state, a very red district [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  and he's even expressing frustration. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=384.24s)]
*  Yeah, not only is he from a very conservative district, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=388.40000000000003s)]
*  he's also a co-chair of the Doge caucus in the house. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=391.32000000000005s)]
*  So he mentioned in that town hall that he was on board [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=394.6s)]
*  with the idea of Doge but the way in which they are going [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=398.68s)]
*  this essentially with an ax instead of a scalpel [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=402.48s)]
*  is kind of the metaphor that we're hearing up here [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=405.56s)]
*  on Capitol Hill is starting to become worrying for him [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=407.8s)]
*  and some other lawmakers. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=411.52s)]
*  This is the kind of age old clash up here on Capitol Hill [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=413.24s)]
*  where you have conservatives wanting to cut the scope [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=417.32s)]
*  and size of government but also fearful [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=421.4s)]
*  of those specific cuts in their individual states [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=424.32s)]
*  or districts and what it does to industries and jobs there. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=427.0s)]
*  But what's new here is Republicans are in a little bit [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=430.79999999999995s)]
*  of a tough spot here because they want [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=434.52s)]
*  the federal government to shrink. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=436.76s)]
*  They want the executive branch to have some power here [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=438.79999999999995s)]
*  but they're also dealing with some of the backlash [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=443.71999999999997s)]
*  in their states. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=446.32s)]
*  Now we're keeping an eye on these town halls [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=447.15999999999997s)]
*  to see if this constituent reaction heightens. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=449.03999999999996s)]
*  You're not really seeing Republicans up here [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=453.79999999999995s)]
*  by and large really waving their arms around about this [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=457.16s)]
*  but they are quietly and more subtly [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=462.16s)]
*  expressing some concerns but also to pick up [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=464.4s)]
*  on Moore's comments about the ways [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=467.4s)]
*  in which federal workers have been demonized [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=469.56s)]
*  and I should note federal workers make 80% of them [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=471.84000000000003s)]
*  are across the country not just here in the DMV area. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=475.36s)]
*  The way in which they've been demonized he said, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=479.28s)]
*  yesterday we also heard from House Republican leaders [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  who were kind of putting forth that rhetoric [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=485.40000000000003s)]
*  and so there has been some concern about the way [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=489.92s)]
*  in which these workers are being treated [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=493.24s)]
*  versus the messaging coming from some lawmakers. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=496.04s)]
*  And now we know that these concerns could continue [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=499.28000000000003s)]
*  and we're seeing obviously developments here [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  and the big question is kind of how these lawmakers [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=506.0s)]
*  address it at home and whether it does reach a point [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=508.64s)]
*  where they have to become, the lawmakers themselves [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=511.84000000000003s)]
*  have to become a little louder on this. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=514.36s)]
*  All right, CBS News congressional correspondent [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=516.6s)]
*  Caitlin Huey-Burns, great to see you Caitlin. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=518.44s)]
*  Thanks so much for being here. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD50HYAGO38&t=520.5600000000001s)]
