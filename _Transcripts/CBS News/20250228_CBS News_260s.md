# White House reacts to shocking Trump-Zelenskyy meeting
**CBS News:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds)
*  Spring in CBS News, chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=0.0s)]
*  She is live right outside where that meeting happened there at the White House. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=2.92s)]
*  Nancy, have you ever seen anything like this before in your many years of reporting at the White House? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=6.92s)]
*  Liz, I was trying to go back and think if I had ever seen a scene like this with a foreign leader, I couldn't recall one. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=15.88s)]
*  One instance that comes to mind is during his first term, President Trump got into a very heated exchange right there in the Oval Office. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=23.4s)]
*  Very similar set up. That was with Democratic leaders, with Nancy Pelosi, with Chuck Schumer. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=32.4s)]
*  You'll recall that kind of famous image coming out of that meeting, Nancy Pelosi in her red coat and her sunglasses, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=38.36s)]
*  kind of doing a little victory walk after she and Schumer had managed to get Trump pretty riled up and there was a very intense back and forth. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=48.68s)]
*  That's the only thing that comes to mind. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=57.68s)]
*  But I think what was different about this situation is that it is literally a life and death conversation that is taking place because it is about the Ukraine War. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=59.68s)]
*  And in this case, it was two against one. The president and the vice president berating the leader of a foreign country. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=70.2s)]
*  Who does not speak English as his first language. In fact, a lot of times, Vladimir Zelensky, when he's doing interviews, when he's giving speeches, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=77.4s)]
*  he chooses to give them in Ukrainian and then they are translated because he's obviously not as comfortable with a back and forth in English as Trump and Vance are. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=84.4s)]
*  And so once this fight really got underway, you could tell that it was difficult for him to get a word in edgewise and to make the points that he wanted to make. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=94.4s)]
*  The White House is celebrating this moment. They have put the video out on X, the social media company, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  and the White House press secretary, Caroline Levitt, posted underneath that video that this is the president and vice president standing up for the American people. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  So let's talk a little bit about why President Zelensky was at the White House in the first place. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  He was supposed to sign this rare earth minerals deal and then potentially talk a path to peace with Russia. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  Any word on the status of what's going to happen with that agreement and where things are now? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  That's a great question. As reporters were leaving the room after that incident, one reporter shouted to the president, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  do you think you can still make a deal? And he said, we'll see. They are talking behind closed doors right now, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=156.0s)]
*  so we don't know what the aftermath of this confrontation looks like. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=162.0s)]
*  And we're also waiting to see if these two leaders go ahead with a scheduled news conference, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=167.0s)]
*  the conference that's supposed to take place right after their private meeting wraps up. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=173.0s)]
*  And we'll get a much better sense once that private meeting is over, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=177.0s)]
*  whether they were able to smooth things over, get this back on track, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=181.2s)]
*  and whether they're still going to plan to come out in front of the world and speak to reporters about what they've decided. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=185.2s)]
*  I think what was clear from the conversation in the Oval Office was that what started this was that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=192.2s)]
*  President Trump really wanted to focus on that minerals deal, what the United States is going to be getting out of it, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=199.2s)]
*  the fact that he was able to cut this deal with Ukraine, his argument that this is going to be a big help for Ukraine, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  and the fact that Zelensky took the opportunity in front of the cameras to make the case about the need for [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=211.39999999999998s)]
*  ongoing security assistance from the United States and why he believes that Vladimir Putin is not someone [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=217.39999999999998s)]
*  to be trusted in any kind of negotiation. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=224.39999999999998s)]
*  And that is what kind of set both Trump and Vice President Vance off and led to Vance basically saying that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=228.6s)]
*  Zelensky was being ungrateful and hadn't said thank you once for all the assistance that he has gotten. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=236.6s)]
*  Yeah, you mentioned earlier in that special report, it's almost like he was scolding him like a teenager [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=244.6s)]
*  for not saying thank you for the support the U.S. has given Ukraine. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=248.6s)]
*  Nancy, of course, we're going to stand by and find out if that press conference and that deal [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=252.6s)]
*  is actually going to happen. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=256.8s)]
*  Thanks so much for being with us. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9IISs-lds&t=258.8s)]
