# Sen. Warren grills Hegseth on past comments about women in combat
**CBS News:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8)
*  Senator Warren. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Hegseth, thank you. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=2.0s)]
*  Thank you for your service. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  So if you're confirmed as Secretary of Defense, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=6.4s)]
*  you will oversee our military, including [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=8.48s)]
*  about a quarter of a million women who currently [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=10.5s)]
*  serve on active duty in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=13.36s)]
*  the Space Forces, and the Marines. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=16.4s)]
*  And I have serious concerns that your behavior toward women [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=18.8s)]
*  disqualifies you from serving in this role. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=23.2s)]
*  Now, I've been trying to get answers from you [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=26.34s)]
*  for quite some time on this. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=28.32s)]
*  You haven't wanted to meet or to answer any of my questions. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=30.4s)]
*  We'll just have to do it here and dive in. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=33.76s)]
*  I want to pick up on some of the questions asked by Senators [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=36.6s)]
*  Shaheen and Gillibrand and Gerono. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=39.4s)]
*  And I just want to make sure we have [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  a list of some of the facts that I think are undisputed. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=43.06s)]
*  I'm not going to talk about anonymous sources. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  I'm just going to quote you directly. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=47.84s)]
*  We've got the video. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=49.7s)]
*  We've got it in print. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  So going back to January 2013, you [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  told a Fox News interviewer that women in the military [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=55.48s)]
*  simply couldn't measure up to men in the military, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=58.64s)]
*  saying that allowing women to serve in combat roles [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=61.31999999999999s)]
*  would force the military to lower the bar. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=64.28s)]
*  You picked up on that same theme in 2015, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=67.56s)]
*  making remarks on Fox News, referring to women in combat [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=70.12s)]
*  as, quote, it would erode standards. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=74.19999999999999s)]
*  June 2024, you said on Ben Shapiro's podcast, quote, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=78.16s)]
*  women shouldn't be in combat at all. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=83.0s)]
*  And then, of course, we've talked about it in 2024. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=87.88s)]
*  You published a book. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=90.72s)]
*  And you say on page 26 of your book, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=92.52s)]
*  we need moms, but not in the military, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=94.84s)]
*  especially in combat units. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=98.36s)]
*  Page 48 of your book, you claim that women should not [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=101.56s)]
*  be in combat roles because men are distracted by women. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=105.12s)]
*  And then 10 weeks ago, you appeared on the Sean Ryan show [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=110.88s)]
*  and said, I'm straight up just saying we should not [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=114.19999999999999s)]
*  have women in combat roles. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  Now, I presume you recall making all these statements? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=120.36s)]
*  Senator, I'm not familiar with the article you're pointing to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=125.44s)]
*  in 2013, but it underscores my argument completely. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=128.64s)]
*  Because in that 2013 argument, I was talking about standards. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  Standards are what it's always been about. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=135.16s)]
*  Let's not have this same fight again. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=137.16s)]
*  Always been about Senate. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=138.24s)]
*  I quoted you directly. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=139.2s)]
*  We've got the video. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=140.56s)]
*  We're happy to show it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=141.92s)]
*  But I want to be clear here. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=143.92s)]
*  For 12 years, you were quite open about your views. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=145.11999999999998s)]
*  And your views were consistently the same. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=148.32s)]
*  Women are inferior soldiers, sailors, Marines, airmen, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  and guardians. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  And in case anyone missed the point, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  and these are your words from 10 weeks ago, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=158.56s)]
*  women absolutely straight up should not [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=161.83999999999997s)]
*  be permitted to serve in combat. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=165.64s)]
*  And I notice on each of these quotes, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=168.52s)]
*  those are said without qualification. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=170.44s)]
*  It's not by how much you can lift or how fast you can run. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=172.68s)]
*  They don't belong in combat, period, or your words, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=176.8s)]
*  straight up. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=181.52s)]
*  And then on November 9, 2024, just 32 days [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=183.16000000000003s)]
*  after your last public comment saying that women absolutely [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=188.60000000000002s)]
*  should not be in combat, you declared that, quote, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=191.96s)]
*  some of our greatest warriors are women. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=195.72s)]
*  And you support having them serve in combat. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=200.12s)]
*  Now, that is a very, very big about face in a very, very [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=203.44s)]
*  short period of time. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=211.12s)]
*  So help me understand, Mr. Hegseth, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=213.56s)]
*  what extraordinary event happened in that 32-day period [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=216.56s)]
*  that made you change the core values you had expressed [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=223.2s)]
*  for the preceding 12 years? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  Senator, again, I very much appreciate you bringing up [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  my comments from 2013, because for me, this issue has always [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  been about standards. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=242.2s)]
*  And unfortunately, because of some of the people that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=243.83999999999997s)]
*  have been in political power over the last four years, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=246.2s)]
*  priorities other than standards, lethality, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=249.39999999999998s)]
*  and meritocracy have driven decision-making. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=251.8s)]
*  Mr. Hegseth, I'm quoting you from the podcast. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=254.84s)]
*  Women shouldn't be in combat at all. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=257.68s)]
*  Where is the reference to standards [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=262.6s)]
*  that they should be there if they can carry, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=265.12s)]
*  if they can run? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=267.64s)]
*  I don't see that at all, Mr. Hegseth. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=269.0s)]
*  What I see is that there's a 32-day period in which you [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=271.8s)]
*  suddenly have another description about your views [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=276.6s)]
*  of women in the military. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=280.8s)]
*  And I just want to know what changed in the 32 days [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=282.76s)]
*  that the song you sang is not the song you come in here today [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=287.32s)]
*  to sing? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  Senator, the concerns I have and the concerns that many have had, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=292.84000000000003s)]
*  especially in ground combat units, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=295.92s)]
*  is that in pursuit of certain percentages or quotas, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=298.12s)]
*  standards have been changed. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=301.68s)]
*  And that makes the combat more difficult for everybody involved. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=303.24s)]
*  Let me make a suggestion about what happened in that 32 days. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=305.88s)]
*  You got a nomination from President Trump. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=309.68s)]
*  Now, I've heard of deathbed conversions, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=312.08s)]
*  but this is the first time I've heard of a nomination conversion. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=314.68s)]
*  And I hope you understand that many women serving [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=318.92s)]
*  in the military right now might think [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=322.72s)]
*  that if you can convert so rapidly your long-held [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=325.64s)]
*  and aggressively pursued views in just 32 days, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=330.64s)]
*  that 32 days after you get confirmed, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=335.72s)]
*  maybe you'll just reverse those views [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=339.24s)]
*  and go back to the old guy who said, straight up, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=341.2s)]
*  women do not belong in combat. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=345.08s)]
*  Now, Mr. Hegstaff, you have written that after they retire, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=348.24s)]
*  generals should be banned from working for the defense [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=351.8s)]
*  industry for 10 years. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=354.6s)]
*  You and I agree on the corrosive effects [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=356.32s)]
*  of the revolving door between the Pentagon and defense [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=359.16s)]
*  contractors. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  It's something I would have liked to talk to you about [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=363.36s)]
*  if you'd come and been willing to visit with me. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=365.6s)]
*  But the question I have for you on this [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=368.76s)]
*  is, will you put your money where your mouth is [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=370.52s)]
*  and agree that when you leave this job, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=373.12s)]
*  you will not work for the defense industry for 10 years? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=375.96s)]
*  Senator, it's not even a question I've thought about. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=380.12s)]
*  Because it's not one that- [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=382.44s)]
*  Think about it right now. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=383.32s)]
*  It's not one. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=384.36s)]
*  My motivation for this job has never been about what could [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=385.59999999999997s)]
*  conceivably come next. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=389.56s)]
*  Time is short. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=391.08s)]
*  I just need a yes or no. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=392.0s)]
*  I would consult with the president [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=393.48s)]
*  about what the policy should be at the defense department. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  You're quite sure that every general who serves [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=397.15999999999997s)]
*  should not go directly into the defense industry for 10 years. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=402.08s)]
*  You're not willing to make that same pledge? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm not a general, Senator. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=409.32s)]
*  You'll be the one, let us just be clear, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=413.12s)]
*  in charge of the generals. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=416.47999999999996s)]
*  So you're saying sauce for the goose, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=418.44s)]
*  but certainly not sauce for the candor? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=421.47999999999996s)]
*  I would want to see what the policy of the president is. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=423.55999999999995s)]
*  Oh, I'll bet you would. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=425.76s)]
*  Thank you, Senator Warren. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K69SS1Utls8&t=426.68s)]
