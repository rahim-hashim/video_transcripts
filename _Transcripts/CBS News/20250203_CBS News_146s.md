# How could Trump's tariffs impact trade at the U.S.-Mexico border?
**CBS News:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s)
*  Let's dig a little deeper now on President Trump's decision to pause tariffs on Mexico. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump agreed to the one month pause after reaching a deal with the president of Mexico. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=5.24s)]
*  Correspondent Jason Allen takes us to a trade hub in Texas to talk about the logistics of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=10.56s)]
*  that agreement and what it means for border communities. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  We're here at the World Trade Bridge in Laredo. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=20.64s)]
*  This is a place where 40% of the goods between Mexico and the U.S. pass back and forth. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=22.68s)]
*  It is essential to this international trade. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=29.2s)]
*  And as you see the trucks that are moving back and forth between the countries, the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=32.04s)]
*  mayor expressed to me yesterday that what he saw was, well, he described it as potentially [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=35.04s)]
*  a game of chicken to see who was going to move first on something that could so substantially [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=41.16s)]
*  impact this trade in North America. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  Well, it does appear now, according to posts from Mexico, the president of Mexico, that [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=48.68s)]
*  there has been an agreement to put these tariffs on pause at least for a month. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=53.44s)]
*  So just 12 to 14 hours before they were set to go in effect, they are on pause. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=58.84s)]
*  This comes after discussions between the two countries and an agreement that both of them [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=63.6s)]
*  will work on security and trade. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=67.88000000000001s)]
*  Mexico's president says they will surge as many as 10,000 troops to the border. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=70.92s)]
*  That is to work on preventing drugs from crossing into the United States, especially fentanyl, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=75.5s)]
*  something President Trump has been concerned about. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=80.2s)]
*  The Trump administration has in turn agreed to do what it can to prevent the movement [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=82.64s)]
*  of high powered weapons over into Mexico, weapons that would potentially go to the drug [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=87.88s)]
*  cartel. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=92.34s)]
*  And the big headline then because of that agreement is that this has been, the tariffs [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=93.34s)]
*  have been put on pause for a month. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=96.86s)]
*  Now in talking with logistics and transportation experts, they expected that if tariffs did [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=99.5s)]
*  go into effect, it would be a few days as everybody figured out how this was going to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=104.9s)]
*  work. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=109.9s)]
*  Would they stay? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=110.9s)]
*  Would companies accept some of that extra cost? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=111.9s)]
*  How much would they pass on to the consumer? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=114.42s)]
*  Once you get past a week, that's when they felt you could see some of the bigger, larger [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=116.54s)]
*  effects. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=120.94000000000001s)]
*  Higher prices, maybe trucking would slow down, maybe warehouse jobs would slow down, and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=121.94000000000001s)]
*  there could potentially be a ripple effect away from these border communities across [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=128.62s)]
*  the country and across North America. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=132.86s)]
*  But for now, those tariffs appear to be on a pause for a month as all countries, Canada, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=135.9s)]
*  the United States, and Mexico continue to talk. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=142.38s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKorVRqJr_s&t=145.74s)]
