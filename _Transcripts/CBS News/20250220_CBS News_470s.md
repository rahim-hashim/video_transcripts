# U.S. cancels joint news conference between Zelenskyy and Trump Ukraine envoy
**CBS News:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg)
*  One month on the job. Today marks exactly one month back in office for President Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's some numbers. So far he has taken, he has issued 73 executive orders. He has [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=5.2s)]
*  spoken with 17 world leaders, held seven news conferences, and at least 43 times he's taken [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=10.96s)]
*  questions in one form or another from White House reporters. Also, on Capitol Hill, Cash [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=18.04s)]
*  Patel confirmed the Senate voted 51 to 49 to make Patel the next head of the FBI. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=23.44s)]
*  Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine voted no. What Patel's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=30.04s)]
*  confirmation means as the effort to reduce the size of the federal workforce begins to [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=35.76s)]
*  move toward the FBI. Peace plans. Today at the Conservative Political Action Conference, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=42.04s)]
*  or as it's more commonly known CPAC, Vice President J.D. Vance told those gathered, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=47.4s)]
*  I really believe that we're in the cusp of peace in Europe for the first time in three years [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=53.2s)]
*  because we have leadership from the Oval Office and we haven't had it in four years. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=65.0s)]
*  We start tonight with Nancy Cordes at the White House, Kaitlin Huey Burns on Capitol Hill. Nancy, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  lots of things going on today in regards to Ukraine, Russia, and ongoing administration [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=76.2s)]
*  efforts. One of the most news gathering or news attentive moments is a press conference [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=83.32s)]
*  was supposed to be a press conference between the Ukrainian president and the president's [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=89.56s)]
*  special envoy. They met, they were supposed to talk, then that was canceled. What's going on? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  Right. Reporters there were led to believe that there was going to be a press conference [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=100.28s)]
*  major after Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, and President [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=105.36s)]
*  Zelensky sat and talked. There was a photo op, but then the reporters were told no press [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  conference, time to go home, and they were told that it was the U.S. side that decided to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=115.48s)]
*  cancel it. We haven't gotten any explanation for why that press conference was canceled, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=120.68s)]
*  but you could probably guess. There's been some tension between the Ukrainians and the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=125.4s)]
*  Americans, the Trump administration at least, in the last couple of days. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=130.0s)]
*  President Zelensky was very vocal about his disappointment that he was left out of talks [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=134.56s)]
*  a couple of days ago in Saudi Arabia between Secretary of State Marco Rubio, other Trump [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=140.0s)]
*  officials, and their counterparts from Russia. And so it's very likely that some of those [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=145.64s)]
*  conflicts, and as you know, President Trump didn't take too kindly to what Zelensky had [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=151.48s)]
*  to say, that that dirty laundry would have been aired in an uncomfortable joint press [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=156.28s)]
*  conference in Kiev. And so we don't know for sure that that's why it was canceled, but [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=161.32s)]
*  it's probably a good guess. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=166.6s)]
*  And it's a fair inference for sure. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=167.8s)]
*  Caitlin, I want to go to you on Capitol Hill. What so far has been the Republican reaction, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=169.56s)]
*  at least among senators you've been able to talk to, about this rift clearly in public [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=174.52s)]
*  view between President Trump and President Zelensky? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=180.52s)]
*  You know, it's interesting, Major, because this is one of the issues, one of the few [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=184.2s)]
*  issues that you're starting to see a little tiny bit of daylight between Republicans and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=187.32s)]
*  Donald Trump, at least when it comes to his rhetoric towards Russia. You've had several [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=193.0s)]
*  Republicans up here on Capitol Hill, including especially the chairman of the Armed Services [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=197.16s)]
*  Committee, Roger Wicker, say very harsh words about Vladimir Putin. He even called him a [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=201.8s)]
*  war criminal and others have had really tough criticisms for him. But they're also, Major, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=207.8s)]
*  willing and ready to give the president deference when it comes to dealing with Russia and Putin, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  especially. So you're not seeing these really heavy handed criticisms of Donald Trump in his [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=223.96s)]
*  approach. You are seeing more criticisms of Putin. And that also speaks to what this body [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  is contending with, which is a Republican Party base that very much is in the mold of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=237.32s)]
*  Donald Trump in terms of foreign policy, covering the campaign. There was a very, you know, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=242.44s)]
*  there was an eagerness among Republican voters to just get this war over with no matter what, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=248.2s)]
*  this belief that the U.S. was spending too much abroad and not enough at home, even though there [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  are separate budgets, and just wanting this war to end and placing faith in the president. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=259.24s)]
*  So while you're seeing a little bit of daylight here, you're really not going to see Republicans, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=264.44s)]
*  by and large, go out on a limb and criticize the president outright. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=268.68s)]
*  Nancy, during today's White House briefing, there were several senior White House officials [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=273.48s)]
*  brought in. You asked about efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency to reduce [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=277.48s)]
*  the federal workforce, and you had sort of an engagement with the National Economic Council [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=282.84s)]
*  chief, Kevin Hassett. How did that go down? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=288.12s)]
*  Well, I asked him why, according to our reporting, other news outlets reporting, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=291.24s)]
*  the cuts at the IRS slated to take place over the next couple of days were slated to be deeper [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=296.6s)]
*  than the cuts that we've seen at most other agencies. According to our reporting, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=303.96s)]
*  3,500 people expected to lose their jobs at the IRS by tomorrow, and the numbers could go up [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=307.8s)]
*  eventually over the next couple of months to 6,000. And what Hassett had to say was that, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=314.36s)]
*  basically, there's plenty of fat to cut there. He said that there are people who are not [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=320.12s)]
*  fully employed with, you know, don't have enough to do, essentially. There are people who have been [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  working from home. And he said there are always ways to find waste. And then I followed up by [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=331.24s)]
*  asking, are you saying that people who are getting fired had poor performance? Because what we're [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=337.32s)]
*  hearing from a lot of people who have been let go at other agencies is that they've been on the job [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=343.0s)]
*  for such a brief period of time, maybe a couple of months, they haven't even had a performance [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=348.6s)]
*  review, and yet they're being told that they're being dropped for poor performance. And he said, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=352.04s)]
*  kind of flippantly, oh, well, people who are performing poorly aren't going to tell you that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=358.04s)]
*  they're doing badly. That's what you're always going to hear. So they definitely believe in [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=363.32s)]
*  this mission. He argued this is still just a small sliver of the overall IRS workforce, which is [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=369.32s)]
*  about 90,000. And so they argue that they can still get the job done with, say, 5% fewer people. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=374.44s)]
*  All right, Nancy. And, Kaitlyn, very quickly to you, this was not an unexpected announcement [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=382.84s)]
*  from Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican senator, but it was news nevertheless today. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=387.56s)]
*  That's right. Mitch McConnell announcing his retirement after having served in the Senate [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=394.52s)]
*  since 1984. It's a very long time. But today it was really notable, Major, because I was watching [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=398.92s)]
*  from the Senate chamber, and he had many colleagues in the chamber listening to his speech today, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=407.16s)]
*  including several Democrats. And at the end, they all applauded him. And several lawmakers went up [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=414.20000000000005s)]
*  to him and congratulated him, shook his hand, paid their respects. And the first two to do so were Lisa [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=420.04s)]
*  Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, the two most moderate senators of this body. And [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=426.12s)]
*  they joked with him about having to put up essentially with moderate senators. And then he joked back [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=431.64s)]
*  saying, well, I guess I'm one of you now. And that really kind of spoke to the way in which Mitch [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=437.4s)]
*  McConnell has been kind of portrayed now in this Trump era. He has voted against Trump's nominees, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=442.92s)]
*  three of Trump's nominees in this time. Now that he's not majority leader, he has been kind of [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=449.96s)]
*  unencumbered from having to deal with those sort of things. And he kind of alluded to in his speech [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=454.76s)]
*  today that he has a lot of unfinished work to do in terms of that as well. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=461.71999999999997s)]
*  Katelyn Hewley-Burton's on Capitol Hill. Nancy Cordes at the White House. Thank you very, very much. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chfEvyw6GYg&t=465.88s)]
