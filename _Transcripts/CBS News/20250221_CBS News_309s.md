# Federal cybersecurity layoffs could leave U.S. vulnerable to hackers
**CBS News:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw)
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=0.0s)]
*  Employees with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, it's better known here as [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=1.36s)]
*  CISA, are awaiting word on possible additional layoffs. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=5.76s)]
*  Last week, the Trump administration fired more than 130 CISA staffers. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=10.52s)]
*  The agency was established in 2018 during President Trump's first term to mitigate the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  risk of cyber and other physical threats to the country and to the nation's election infrastructure. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=20.36s)]
*  That was one of its delineated obligations. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=27.28s)]
*  Now, people who are experts in this field fear that they could create vulnerabilities, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  cyber and otherwise, for our election infrastructure and other important dimensions. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=36.24s)]
*  For more, I want to bring in CBS News' election law expert, David Becker. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=42.28s)]
*  He is also the executive director at the Center for Election Innovation and Research and co-author [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  of an excellent book called The Big Truth. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=51.52s)]
*  I highly recommend it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  David, CISA and the layoffs and also some carve-outs at FBI and this particular agency. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=55.8s)]
*  Walk the audience through both. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=61.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=62.72s)]
*  We should remember CISA, as you mentioned, was established in 2018 under the Trump administration. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=63.72s)]
*  It was the successor to a similar organization with the Department of Homeland Security [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=68.28s)]
*  that was founded around when elections were made critical infrastructure, designated critical [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=72.48s)]
*  infrastructure in the United States. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=77.66s)]
*  And that was because in 2016 and thereabouts, Russia, agents of the Russian government and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=78.88s)]
*  perhaps others were trying to seek access to election systems. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=83.28s)]
*  They were spreading disinformation. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=86.28s)]
*  They'd even successfully gained access to a system that didn't ultimately have any effect [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=87.28s)]
*  on the election. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=91.72s)]
*  But it was important for the federal government to assist the states who run these elections [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=93.12s)]
*  to ensure that our elections were secure. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  So CISA was established in 2018 under the Trump administration with a mission to protect [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=99.36s)]
*  our election system from this kind of hacking. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=103.7s)]
*  And it was incredibly successful, both during the Trump administration and during the Biden [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=106.12s)]
*  administration. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=110.0s)]
*  It was widely regarded as successful. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=111.12s)]
*  And even states that were run by Republicans that were initially reluctant to have this [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=113.64s)]
*  sort of federal interaction and oversight came around on that and found it to be valuable. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  That's such an important point. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=121.4s)]
*  Back when it first occurred that the critical infrastructure designation, there was some [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=122.84s)]
*  concern particularly from some of the Republican states that this might lead to a federal takeover. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=128.0s)]
*  And yet fast forward to today when that CISA election team has essentially been disbanded [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  and their work is likely not going to be renewed. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=137.96s)]
*  The National Association of Secretaries of State, a bipartisan organization, sent a letter [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=141.36s)]
*  just today really recommending that the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=145.62s)]
*  Re-evaluate this. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, re-evaluate this, that their work was so crucial it was signed by a Democratic secretary [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=151.32000000000002s)]
*  of state in Minnesota and a Republican secretary of state in Mississippi. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=155.0s)]
*  So this demonstrates how crucial this work had been, how successful it had been. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=158.28000000000003s)]
*  It was even so successful that there were several current and former Republican secretaries [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=162.56s)]
*  prior to this unit being disbanded had been vying to lead this unit under the Trump administration. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=167.6s)]
*  But now since this unit is likely to disbanded that won't occur. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=173.28s)]
*  How much of this is caught up in election denialism after 2020? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=175.98s)]
*  I mean it's likely a significant amount of it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=180.72s)]
*  I mean the CISO had been really, had really importantly stood up for the integrity of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=182.64s)]
*  election officials and the system itself. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=189.26s)]
*  And the security of the system. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=191.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=192.72s)]
*  Didn't comment on the outcome, just said it was a secure election. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=193.84s)]
*  CISA in both 2020 and 2024 with very different outcomes. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=196.52s)]
*  Of course. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=200.12s)]
*  Had reached the same conclusion that there was no evidence for any doubt about the outcomes. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=201.12s)]
*  The states had done a remarkable job and in fact they had. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=204.52s)]
*  So it's likely this is somewhat tied up to that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=207.4s)]
*  We've seen a page on the CISA website, Rumor Control, that they had started in around 2020 [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=210.36s)]
*  when there was a lot of disinformation, a lot of it originating from our foreign adversaries [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=216.12s)]
*  to debunk some of that information and provide some resources to the states to help them [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  debunk some of the information about elections. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=224.36s)]
*  That has been taken down off of the CISA website and it might be that other similar sites are [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=226.52s)]
*  taking that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=231.4s)]
*  And hostile foreign actors remain in this space. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=232.4s)]
*  Yeah, more than remain. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=235.28s)]
*  They're likely ramping up efforts. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=236.84s)]
*  I mean you can imagine if you're trying to attack some kind of system and that system [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  just unilaterally disarms and takes much of its defense away, that is only going to embolden [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=245.36s)]
*  the attackers. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=251.08s)]
*  And I think there's no evidence that we've seen over the course of a decade now that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=252.08s)]
*  adversaries like Russia, China, Iran and others are going to ramp down their efforts. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=256.12s)]
*  They're only ramping them up with disinformation, perhaps attacks on our infrastructure. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=261.12s)]
*  And so our ability to fend against those attacks has been weakened by weakening CISA. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=266.6s)]
*  And for those in our audience who might say, well the states can defend themselves. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=271.36s)]
*  This letter that came out today suggests no, they would like some of this federal help [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=274.2s)]
*  to continue. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=279.08s)]
*  Well the states don't have the resources of the Federal Department of Homeland Security. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=280.08s)]
*  They don't have the resources of the intelligence community of the United States. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=283.08s)]
*  They don't have a variety of resources and also they might just be focused on what's [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=286.52s)]
*  happening in their state. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=289.64s)]
*  And what's happening in their state might be part of a broader attack across other states. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=291.12s)]
*  And CISA was essential in connecting all of those dots for the election officials so they [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=295.08s)]
*  others try to forge a common defense against some of these things. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=300.56s)]
*  That's going to be severely weakened in this new environment. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=304.48s)]
*  David Becker, thanks very much for coming in. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=306.52s)]
*  Thanks Major. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7wV-1xpIw&t=308.36s)]
