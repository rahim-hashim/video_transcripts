# Ukrainians react to Trump's growing feud with Zelenskyy
**CBS News:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc)
*  In that press conference yesterday, President Trump appeared more in line with Russian President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=0.0s)]
*  Vladimir Putin, suggesting Ukraine was to blame for the Russian invasion. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=4.12s)]
*  President leveled even more pointed criticism at President Vladimir Zelensky today. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=8.92s)]
*  In a post on Truth Social, President Trump said Zelensky was, quote, a dictator without [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=13.0s)]
*  elections and that if he didn't move fast, Zelensky wouldn't have a country left. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=17.28s)]
*  Ukraine has been under martial law and has not held elections since Russia invaded in [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=22.96s)]
*  2022. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  Before the post, Zelensky said Trump was living in a so-called disinformation space created [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=27.88s)]
*  by Russia. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=32.48s)]
*  James Waterhouse from our partners at the BBC has the latest. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=33.56s)]
*  An extraordinary allegation from Ukraine's once biggest ally. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=36.56s)]
*  I think I have the power to end this war and I think it's going very well. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=41.96s)]
*  But today I heard, oh, well, we weren't invited. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  Well, you've been there for three years. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=48.28s)]
*  You should have ended it three years. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=49.78s)]
*  You should have never started it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=51.54s)]
*  You could have made a deal. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=52.76s)]
*  Leading to an unprecedented response from President Zelensky, who accused Donald Trump [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=55.04s)]
*  of living in a bubble. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=59.84s)]
*  It is unfortunate that President Trump, and with great respect for him as the leader of [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=63.28s)]
*  the American people who constantly support us, unfortunately lives in this disinformation [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=67.4s)]
*  space. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  On his Truth Social platform, Trump doubled down. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=73.6s)]
*  He refuses to have elections, he said. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=77.08s)]
*  He's very low in Ukrainian polls. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=79.16s)]
*  He then described Ukraine's leader as a dictator without elections. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=81.4s)]
*  Zelensky better move fast, he added, or he's not going to have a country left. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  What President Zelensky is not is a dictator. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  Elections have legally been postponed here since the start of the invasion. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=93.66000000000001s)]
*  So perhaps not a good day for America's envoy to Ukraine, Kyiv Kellogg, to visit. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=97.16000000000001s)]
*  Washington claims it is successfully negotiating an end to the war with Russia, where Vladimir [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  Putin is enjoying a rekindling of relations. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=109.36s)]
*  It is impossible to solve many issues, including the Ukrainian crisis, without increasing the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=114.36s)]
*  level of trust between Russia and the United States. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  Away from the politics, Ukraine's capital is just trying to get on. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=124.16s)]
*  Russian tanks were expected to be in Kyiv within days on that morning three years ago. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=129.28s)]
*  And the fact that they were stopped is something people are very proud of. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=133.84s)]
*  But America's new foreign policy and how Russia reacts to it means Ukraine could still [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=138.12s)]
*  lose this war. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=143.16s)]
*  Like any city, you just need to scratch beneath the surface. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=144.76s)]
*  Almost everyone knows someone who's been injured or killed. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=147.88s)]
*  If Trump doesn't want to be with us, if he doesn't want to support Ukraine, then essentially [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=152.6s)]
*  he's betraying his voters, betraying America and its ideals, the very ideals we are defending [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=157.28s)]
*  here. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=163.68s)]
*  For Ukraine, everything will be all right. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=166.76s)]
*  Our guys are not fighting in vain there. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=169.48s)]
*  We're optimistic and hopeful. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=172.2s)]
*  We will definitely win. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=176.88s)]
*  But I don't think we will feel joy from that, because my brother and my cousin were killed. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=178.64s)]
*  And it's the same for nearly every family. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  A reminder of the sacrifice Ukraine has made to withstand Russia's aggression. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=188.76s)]
*  The last 24 hours has put it at risk of being for nothing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_hn3TU-Yc&t=194.12s)]
