# Middle East reacts to Trump plan to take over Gaza
**CBS News:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU)
*  For more on this, I'm joined now by Awa Damon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=0.0s)]
*  She's a journalist who covered the region extensively. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  I remember this during our time at CNN. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=5.76s)]
*  She's also founder of International Network [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=8.48s)]
*  for Aid, Relief, and Assistance. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=10.4s)]
*  Awa, as we just mentioned, Saudi Arabia [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=12.52s)]
*  is rejecting President Trump's proposal, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=14.48s)]
*  but help us understand just how inflammatory that remark [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=16.92s)]
*  is being received in the region. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=23.16s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's quite remarkable [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=25.16s)]
*  and rather stunning that we have just heard [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=30.16s)]
*  the US president, the leader of the self-declared [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=33.16s)]
*  biggest democracy of the world, effectively, openly, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=36.96s)]
*  saying that the US has the potential intent [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=41.96s)]
*  to draw the United States into a war crime, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=44.96s)]
*  the war crime of forced displacement [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=48.16s)]
*  of an entire population, which effectively amounts [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=52.56s)]
*  to ethnic cleansing. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=56.56s)]
*  Now, at this stage, some analysts are dismissing this [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  as Trump's regular, sort of at times illogical [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=60.56s)]
*  or oftentimes illogical rhetoric, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=65.28s)]
*  but at the same time, these words carry a lot of weight, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=67.64s)]
*  and what it does is send ripples of fear [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=70.92s)]
*  through the leaderships in the region, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=73.56s)]
*  through the governments here, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=75.88s)]
*  but also through the Palestinian population itself. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=76.88s)]
*  When it comes to the leadership here with the pressure [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=80.88s)]
*  that the US has been wanting and has been putting [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=83.72s)]
*  on Egypt and Jordan to take at least one, if not 1.5 [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  or more million Gazans has been enormous. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=92.24s)]
*  Those two countries have been pushing back, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=95.84s)]
*  but remember how reliant they are on US support and US aid. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=98.44s)]
*  Now, Saudi Arabia's pretty quick statement [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=103.16s)]
*  is rather telling, and it might serve to give Jordan [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  and Egypt the sort of courage they need to continue [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=109.84s)]
*  to stand up to the United States. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  The thing is, hypothetically speaking, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=116.04s)]
*  if Palestinians were guaranteed the right of return, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=119.76s)]
*  we would be having a very different conversation right now, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=123.84s)]
*  but the notion of forced displacement having to go [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=127.36s)]
*  through exactly what their grandparents [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=131.84s)]
*  and their great grandparents went through in 1948 and 1967 [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=134.24s)]
*  to have their homes forcibly taken from them, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=139.16s)]
*  their land forcibly taken from them, families divided. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=142.16s)]
*  This is the worst nightmare unfolding right now [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=145.64s)]
*  for Palestinians. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=150.76s)]
*  What was missing from President Trump's remarks, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=151.92s)]
*  he said it could create jobs by reconstructing the area, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=154.4s)]
*  was what Palestinian people actually want. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  And now at this almost second phase of the ceasefire [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=161.88s)]
*  and hostage release agreement, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=165.44s)]
*  I'm wondering how these remarks itself [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=167.16s)]
*  might endanger the agreement continuing. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=170.12s)]
*  Well, that's an ongoing fear among the population. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=174.52s)]
*  And I was actually talking to a couple of people about that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=177.72s)]
*  this very morning, trying to ask them [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=180.64s)]
*  what they were thinking. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=182.4s)]
*  And the general sort of remarks that you hear [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=183.28s)]
*  is that on the one hand, some people are, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, they're so focused, Errol, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  on trying to clean out what's left of their home [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=191.28s)]
*  if there's anything left or trying to figure out [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=194.6s)]
*  if there's a large enough slab of concrete [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=197.4s)]
*  or some little bit of land that can be cleared of rubble [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=201.24s)]
*  to put their tents closer to what was their home. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=204.6s)]
*  They're trying to figure out how as they move [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=207.84s)]
*  from south to north, especially into the northernmost parts [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  of Gaza, where they're gonna have access to clean water, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=213.4s)]
*  that they're not necessarily hyper-focused [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=216.4s)]
*  on what it is that the US is saying, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=219.68s)]
*  but as they are thinking about it [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  and they're asking someone, they're asked the question, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=225.12s)]
*  they keep highlighting how it's, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=226.60000000000002s)]
*  it's trauma on top of trauma on top of trauma. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=228.68s)]
*  The soul, the psyche, especially Gazans right now [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=232.16000000000003s)]
*  has been so psychologically shredded. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=236.16000000000003s)]
*  They're trying to cope with everything that they've lost. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=238.84s)]
*  On top of that, there's this very real fear [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=241.08s)]
*  that the ceasefire isn't gonna hold. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=243.44000000000003s)]
*  And then if it doesn't, what do they actually do? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=245.24s)]
*  And then on top of all of that, right now, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=248.4s)]
*  the president of the United States [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=250.56s)]
*  talking about possibly permanent forced displacement, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=252.44s)]
*  it's brain and soul crushing, Errol. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=256.16s)]
*  Well, Awa, it's great to have you join us [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=259.24s)]
*  and remind us that the suffering continues [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=261.24s)]
*  for so many there. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=263.08s)]
*  Awa Damon, thank you. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iceYO8y0LuU&t=264.56s)]
