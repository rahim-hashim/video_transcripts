# Judge to hear lawsuits challenging Trump order to end birthright citizenship
**CBS News:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM)
*  A judge in Seattle is set to hear lawsuits filed by four states tomorrow challenging [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=0.0s)]
*  the constitutionality of President Trump's executive order seeking to eliminate birthright [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=6.3s)]
*  citizenship. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=11.68s)]
*  18 other states have also filed in federal court in Massachusetts claiming Trump's initiative [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=12.68s)]
*  violates the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  States that the executive order violates the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=22.46s)]
*  It also violates the Immigration and Nationality Act and flouts more than 125 years, a century [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=28.82s)]
*  and a quarter of long-standing, well-established precedent set by the U.S. Supreme Court. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=38.3s)]
*  The White House hit back at the suits calling them quote, nothing more than an extension [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=45.78s)]
*  of the left's resistance and the Trump administration is ready to face them in court, end quote. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=50.34s)]
*  Joining us now to discuss all this is Lenny B. Benson. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=56.019999999999996s)]
*  She's a distinguished professor of immigration and human rights law at the New York Law School. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=58.78s)]
*  It is great to speak to you on a topic like this today because in any other year we might [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=63.42s)]
*  think that these rights are protected under the Constitution, but really isn't this all [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=69.54s)]
*  about how the Supreme Court interprets the Constitution and established law? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=73.94s)]
*  Just help us understand how the president's executive orders may function. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=78.34s)]
*  So first I think the audience should remember our founders did not want a monarch in charge [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=84.3s)]
*  of our government. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=89.8s)]
*  And so the whole structure of the Constitution, we call it checks and balances, our Congress [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=91.17999999999999s)]
*  writes the law. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  And interestingly nowhere in the Constitution in the original draft or the original document [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=98.42s)]
*  that was adopted in the beginning of the country did it define citizenship. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=104.14s)]
*  It was left to Congress to write statutes to define the national citizenship. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=109.34s)]
*  So really Mr. Trump's executive order is attempting with his pen to not only rewrite the Constitution, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=114.66s)]
*  rewrite the congressional statutes that interpret the Constitution and overturn a longstanding [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=123.06s)]
*  precedent of the Supreme Court. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=129.14000000000001s)]
*  President Trump likely though in his team would have known that there would be this [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=132.06s)]
*  type of challenge to such a dramatic move. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=135.74s)]
*  And we have seen the Supreme Court in recent years move in a more conservative direction, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=139.70000000000002s)]
*  upending Roe vs. Wade, gutting the Civil Rights Act. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=145.18s)]
*  So in essence, could we be in new territory here where they may agree in his favor? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  All of the scholars that I know who studied this, and they include a broad spectrum of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=157.62s)]
*  people believe that the legislative history about the 14th Amendment and the text of the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=161.7s)]
*  amendment itself supports a conservative justice following the will of the people in amending [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=169.17999999999998s)]
*  the Constitution and in Congress in adopting its statutes. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=176.54s)]
*  To allow a president's order to overcome or change the interpretation without the traditional [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=180.78s)]
*  historical analysis or textual analysis is very unlikely even in this conservative court. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=188.26s)]
*  But I do want to say that Mr. Trump has had this issue on his agenda even before he was elected in the prior term. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=193.7s)]
*  Many politicians since the Reagan era have introduced bills in Congress to try to limit the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=201.57999999999998s)]
*  citizenship for people born in the territory. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=207.22s)]
*  And what will be the tragic result until a court can stop this executive order is that anyone, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=209.7s)]
*  a U.S. citizen, a permanent resident, anyone applying for documents that require proof of citizenship [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=217.18s)]
*  will likely now have to establish proof of their parents' citizenship or status. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=223.62s)]
*  And for many people in the United States, their parents have passed away or there's no records even in the federal system of what status their parents were in. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=230.02s)]
*  They could have been here as a student, a work visa. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=238.38s)]
*  They could have had a time period where several generations before, like my own grandfather, he naturalized as a child. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=241.17999999999998s)]
*  There is no record with his name on it that says he's a U.S. citizen. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=249.42s)]
*  So it's really a fear tactic. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=253.98s)]
*  And unfortunately, if courts do not stop this, what President Trump does have the power to do is slow down any application of federal government [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=256.62s)]
*  making like a passport or visa petition until you can absolutely prove your citizenship to their satisfaction. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=267.38s)]
*  And just as a point of reference, Trump's mother, late mother, Scottish, Professor Lenny B. Benson, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=275.38s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naima1iv1EM&t=283.53999999999996s)]
