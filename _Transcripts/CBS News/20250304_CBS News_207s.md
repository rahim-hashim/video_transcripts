# Rep. Al Green escorted out of House chamber for interrupting Trump's address
**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvBxq01SdvY)
*  We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvBxq01SdvY&t=0.0s)]
*  And won counties in our country, 2,700 to 525, on a map that reads almost completely red for Republican. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvBxq01SdvY&t=31.0s)]
*  Now for the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction than the wrong direction. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvBxq01SdvY&t=45.0s)]
*  In fact, it's an astonishing record, 27 points swing, the most ever. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvBxq01SdvY&t=59.0s)]
*  Likewise, small business optimism saw its single largest one month gain ever recorded, a 41 point jump. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvBxq01SdvY&t=75.0s)]
*  Members are directed to uphold and maintain decorum in the House and to cease any further disruptions. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvBxq01SdvY&t=95.0s)]
*  That's your warning. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvBxq01SdvY&t=102.0s)]
*  Members are engaging in willful and continuing breach of decorum, and the chair is prepared to direct the sergeant at arms to restore order to the joint session. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvBxq01SdvY&t=105.0s)]
*  Mr. Green, take your seat. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvBxq01SdvY&t=135.0s)]
*  Take your seat, sir. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvBxq01SdvY&t=141.0s)]
*  Take your seat. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvBxq01SdvY&t=143.0s)]
*  Take your seat. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvBxq01SdvY&t=145.0s)]
*  As the members continue to engage in willful and concerted disruption of proper decorum, the chair now directs the sergeant at arms to restore order. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvBxq01SdvY&t=149.0s)]
*  Remove this gentleman from the chamber. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvBxq01SdvY&t=159.0s)]
*  That is Congressman Green of Texas, 77 years old. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvBxq01SdvY&t=179.0s)]
*  He is being escorted out of the chamber at the order of the Speaker of the House because he was not maintaining decorum during the president's speech. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvBxq01SdvY&t=196.0s)]
