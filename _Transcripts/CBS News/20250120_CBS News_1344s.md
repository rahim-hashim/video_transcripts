# 6 moments from Trump's second inaugural address
**CBS News:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8)
*  Thank you very much everybody. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=0.0s)]
*  The golden age of America begins right now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=9.48s)]
*  From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=21.72s)]
*  We will be the envy of every nation and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=28.34s)]
*  of any longer. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=33.54s)]
*  During every single day of the Trump administration, I will very simply put America first. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=36.54s)]
*  Our sovereignty will be reclaimed. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=53.46s)]
*  Our safety will be restored. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=56.86s)]
*  The scales of justice will be rebalanced. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=59.42s)]
*  The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=63.7s)]
*  will end. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=69.53999999999999s)]
*  And our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous, and free. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=78.62s)]
*  America will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=90.98s)]
*  I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=103.38s)]
*  thrilling new era of national success. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=108.58s)]
*  A tide of change is sweeping the country. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=112.25999999999999s)]
*  Sunlight is pouring over the entire world and America has the chance to seize this [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=115.02s)]
*  opportunity like never before. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=120.34s)]
*  But first we must be honest about the challenges we face. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=123.62s)]
*  While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=127.89999999999999s)]
*  witnessing in the United States of America. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=133.14s)]
*  As we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=137.33999999999997s)]
*  For many years a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=141.77999999999997s)]
*  while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=147.89999999999998s)]
*  We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home while at the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=154.92s)]
*  same time stumbling into a continuing catalogue of catastrophic events abroad. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=159.74s)]
*  It fails to protect our magnificent law-abiding American citizens but provides sanctuary and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=166.10000000000002s)]
*  protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions that have [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  illegally entered our country from all over the world. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=178.58s)]
*  We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=182.5s)]
*  but refuses to defend American borders or more importantly its own people. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=187.98s)]
*  Our country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency as recently shown by [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=194.85999999999999s)]
*  the wonderful people of North Carolina who have been treated so badly. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=201.22s)]
*  And other states who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=211.57999999999998s)]
*  or more recently Los Angeles where we are watching fires still tragically burn from [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=217.1s)]
*  weeks ago without even a token of defense. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=223.1s)]
*  They're raging through the houses and communities even affecting some of the wealthiest and [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=227.85999999999999s)]
*  most powerful individuals in our country, some of whom are sitting here right now. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=232.44s)]
*  They don't have a home any longer. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=238.2s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=240.7s)]
*  But we can't let this happen. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=241.7s)]
*  Everyone is unable to do anything about it that's going to change. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=245.26s)]
*  We have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster yet more money [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=250.85999999999999s)]
*  is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=255.23999999999998s)]
*  And we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves in [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=259.68s)]
*  many cases, to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=264.34s)]
*  to them. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=270.24s)]
*  All of this will change starting today and it will change very quickly. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=272.02s)]
*  From this moment on, America's decline is over. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=286.98s)]
*  Our liberties and our nation's glorious destiny will no longer be denied and we will immediately [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=302.06s)]
*  restore the integrity, competency and loyalty of America's government. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=309.26s)]
*  Over the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=315.42s)]
*  our 250 year history and I've learned a lot along the way. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=319.62s)]
*  The journey to reclaim our republic has not been an easy one, that I can tell you. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=325.73999999999995s)]
*  Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and indeed to take my life. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=332.58s)]
*  Just a few months ago in a beautiful Pennsylvania field an assassin's bullet ripped through [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=341.65999999999997s)]
*  my ear. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=346.62s)]
*  But I felt then and believe even more so now that my life was saved for a reason. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=349.66s)]
*  I was saved by God to make America great again. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=355.82s)]
*  Many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=369.78s)]
*  But as you see today, here I am, the American people have spoken. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=377.86s)]
*  Today I will sign a series of historic executive orders. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=388.86s)]
*  With these actions we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=393.5s)]
*  of common sense. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=399.26s)]
*  It's all about common sense. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=401.06s)]
*  First, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=404.46s)]
*  All illegal entry will immediately be halted and we will begin the process of returning [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=434.73999999999995s)]
*  millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=443.73999999999995s)]
*  We will reinstate my remain in Mexico policy. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=450.74s)]
*  I will end the practice of catch and release. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=458.02s)]
*  And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=467.02s)]
*  Under the orders I signed today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=476.29999999999995s)]
*  organizations. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=487.94s)]
*  And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=506.94s)]
*  the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=514.42s)]
*  of all foreign gangs and criminal networks, bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=519.54s)]
*  our cities and inner cities. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=528.3s)]
*  As Commander-in-Chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=536.5s)]
*  invasions and that is exactly what I am going to do. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=543.1s)]
*  We will do it at a level that nobody's ever seen before. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=548.1s)]
*  Next, I will direct all members of my Cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=551.5799999999999s)]
*  to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=557.5799999999999s)]
*  The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=566.02s)]
*  and that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=576.26s)]
*  We will drill, baby, drill. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=582.78s)]
*  America will be a manufacturing nation once again and we have something that no other [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=596.02s)]
*  manufacturing nation will ever have, the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=610.66s)]
*  and we are going to use it. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=617.14s)]
*  We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top and export [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=620.26s)]
*  American energy all over the world. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=631.9399999999999s)]
*  We will be a rich nation again and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=639.98s)]
*  to do it. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=646.58s)]
*  With my actions today we will end the Green New Deal and we will revoke the electric vehicle [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=648.44s)]
*  mandate saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American auto [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=653.96s)]
*  workers. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=660.96s)]
*  In other words, you will be able to buy the car of your choice. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=667.96s)]
*  We will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=679.26s)]
*  just a few years ago and thank you to the auto workers of our nation for your inspiring [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=684.1600000000001s)]
*  vote of confidence. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=690.58s)]
*  We did tremendously with their vote. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=692.08s)]
*  I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=697.08s)]
*  and families. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=704.0s)]
*  Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=706.0s)]
*  countries to enrich our citizens. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=712.5200000000001s)]
*  For this purpose we are establishing the external revenue service to collect all tariffs, duties [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=719.76s)]
*  and revenues. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=732.28s)]
*  It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our treasury coming from foreign sources. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=733.1999999999999s)]
*  The American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before to restore competence and [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=740.48s)]
*  effectiveness to our federal government. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=746.6s)]
*  My administration will establish the brand new Department of Government Efficiency. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=749.36s)]
*  After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=768.32s)]
*  I will also sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=774.84s)]
*  free speech to America. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=781.6800000000001s)]
*  Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=788.68s)]
*  opponents. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=806.3199999999999s)]
*  Something I know something about. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=808.0s)]
*  We will not allow that to happen. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=811.0799999999999s)]
*  It will not happen again. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=813.04s)]
*  Under my leadership we will restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=814.88s)]
*  rule of law. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=821.32s)]
*  And we are going to bring law and order back to our cities. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=827.68s)]
*  This week I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=836.96s)]
*  into every aspect of public and private life. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=844.24s)]
*  We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit based. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=855.36s)]
*  As of today it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=866.72s)]
*  there are only two genders, male and female. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=873.0s)]
*  This week I will reinstate any service members who were unjustly expelled from our military [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=894.88s)]
*  for objecting to the COVID vaccine mandate with full back pain. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=900.44s)]
*  And I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=917.44s)]
*  theories and social experiments while on duty. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=922.9000000000001s)]
*  It's going to end immediately. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=926.24s)]
*  Our armed forces will be free to focus on their sole mission, defeating America's enemies. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=932.2s)]
*  Like in 2017 we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=956.24s)]
*  We will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=972.48s)]
*  we end and perhaps most importantly the wars we never get into. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=978.32s)]
*  My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That's what I want to be, a [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=986.24s)]
*  peacemaker and a unifier. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1009.12s)]
*  I'm pleased to say that as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1011.76s)]
*  in the Middle East are coming back home to their families. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1018.72s)]

*  nation on earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world. A short time from now [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1038.7s)]
*  we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America and [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1046.5s)]
*  we will restore the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley where [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1053.74s)]
*  it should be and where it belongs. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1060.74s)]
*  President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent. He was [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1073.58s)]
*  a natural businessman and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1080.06s)]
*  did including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1085.5s)]
*  after the United States. The United States, I mean think of this, spent more money than [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1092.1s)]
*  ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1098.72s)]
*  We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1107.5s)]
*  and Panama's promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1112.8200000000002s)]
*  our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1119.5400000000002s)]
*  treated fairly in any way, shape or form and that includes the United States Navy. And [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1127.5s)]
*  above all China is operating the Panama Canal and we didn't give it to China, we gave it [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1134.9s)]
*  to Panama and we're taking it back. So as we liberate our nation we will lead it to [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1140.7s)]
*  new heights of victory and success. We will not be deterred. Together we will end the [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1151.5400000000002s)]

*  our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations and carries our flag into new [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1171.26s)]
*  and beautiful horizons. And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars launching [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1177.78s)]
*  American astronauts to plant the stars and stripes on the planet Mars. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1183.74s)]
*  Ambition is the lifeblood of a great nation and right now our nation is more ambitious [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1194.26s)]
*  than any other. There's no nation like our nation. Americans are explorers, builders, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1201.26s)]
*  innovators, entrepreneurs and pioneers. The spirit of the frontier is written into our [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1208.26s)]

*  ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of the world. The American people [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1224.82s)]
*  are the most important part of our nation. Our nation is the most important part of our [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1233.34s)]
*  American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1240.86s)]
*  a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on earth. No one comes close. Americans [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1246.8999999999999s)]
*  push thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness. They cross deserts, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1254.34s)]
*  scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the wild west, ended slavery, rescued millions [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1261.86s)]
*  from tyranny, lifted billions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1268.7s)]
*  mankind into the heavens and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1276.06s)]

*  Many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1290.68s)]
*  but as you see today here I am, the American people have spoken. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1298.0800000000002s)]
*  I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1321.88s)]
*  to do. In America the impossible is what we do best. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6RJM5r0y8&t=1326.88s)]
