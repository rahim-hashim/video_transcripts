# Trump pausing tariffs on Mexico for a month
**CBS News:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ)
*  Right off the top, stocks tumbling now as Wall Street braces for the impact of tariffs [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=0.0s)]
*  ordered by President Trump. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=6.8s)]
*  But the president just put a pause on potential trade war with Mexico after signing an executive [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=8.2s)]
*  order to tariff three of America's largest trading partners, Canada, Mexico and China. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=13.56s)]
*  And just moments ago, the Mexican president said that she has reached an agreement with [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=20.06s)]
*  Trump to avoid tariffs for one month. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=24.0s)]
*  Trump also says he spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this morning. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=27.24s)]
*  The two are scheduled to talk later again this afternoon. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  China already threatened a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization for quote, wrongful [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=34.12s)]
*  practices of the U.S. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=38.839999999999996s)]
*  They have yet to say if they will be rolling back that lawsuit. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=40.8s)]
*  Now the president said the tariffs are about immigration and drugs and he blames all three [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=44.4s)]
*  countries for not doing enough to stop fentanyl from entering the U.S. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=48.2s)]
*  Trump also pointed the finger at Mexico and Canada for allowing migrants over the border. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  And he acknowledged the impact these tariffs would have on Americans yesterday. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=56.98s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=60.62s)]
*  We may have short term, some little pain and people understand that, but long term the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=61.62s)]
*  United States has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=67.9s)]
*  We have deficits with almost every country, not every country, but almost. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=72.53999999999999s)]
*  And we're going to change it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=77.38s)]
*  It's been unfair. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=78.38s)]
*  That's why we owe 36 trillion dollars. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=79.38s)]
*  We have deficits with everybody. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=81.38s)]
*  We help everybody. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=84.14s)]
*  We've been helping everybody for years. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=85.14s)]
*  And to be honest, I don't think they appreciate it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=87.14s)]
*  CBS News Chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes joins us now with more. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=90.14s)]
*  Nancy, thank you for being with us. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=93.5s)]
*  What more can you tell us about these conversations this morning? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=95.3s)]
*  Well, they appear to be bearing fruit, Liz. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=98.42s)]
*  Let's just break down the post that President Trump himself put up a short time ago in which [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=103.06s)]
*  he said that he had spoken to the president of Mexico. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=107.86s)]
*  He said it was a very friendly conversation and she had agreed to immediately supply 10,000 [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=111.74s)]
*  Mexican soldiers on the border separating Mexico and the United States. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=118.22s)]
*  He further went on to say that these soldiers are going to be specifically designated to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=122.3s)]
*  stop the flow of fentanyl. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=125.69999999999999s)]
*  And in exchange for those 10,000 soldiers, he has agreed to halt the tariffs on Mexico [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=128.16s)]
*  only, not Canada, not China, but only Mexico, that were supposed to going to affect tomorrow [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=134.5s)]
*  for one month while they continue negotiations. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=139.70000000000002s)]
*  And so he's heralding this as a deal that he has reached with one of the countries. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=144.22s)]
*  We also know that he has spoken with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada this morning, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=149.94s)]
*  slated to speak to him again this afternoon. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=155.70000000000002s)]
*  So we'll see if those conversations are headed down a similar track where he is looking to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=158.46s)]
*  extract some kind of promise in exchange for at least temporarily lifting the tariffs [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=163.54s)]
*  that he announced just this weekend. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=169.78s)]
*  And meanwhile, Nancy, Trump continues to push for control of the Panama Canal. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=172.5s)]
*  Take a listen to what some of you had to say. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=176.89999999999998s)]
*  I don't think troops will be necessary in Panama. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=180.85999999999999s)]
*  What Panama has done is terrible financial security for this part of the world. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=184.57999999999998s)]
*  It was the most expensive project ever built by this country, if you take it forward. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=189.06s)]
*  The most expensive project ever built. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=194.58s)]
*  We lost 38,000. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=197.14000000000001s)]
*  And what happens? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=198.58s)]
*  China owns it all of a sudden? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=200.42000000000002s)]
*  It's not going to happen. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=202.1s)]
*  We're not going to let that happen. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=203.06s)]
*  We have national security concerns, and they wouldn't let it happen either. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=204.58s)]
*  Now, this is all coming as Secretary of State Marco Rubio is wrapping up his time in Panama [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=209.62s)]
*  as part of his first international trip in this new role. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=214.34s)]
*  What was Rubio's message to the Panamanian president and where does he head next? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=217.62s)]
*  His message, Liz, was that Panama needs to do more to reduce Chinese influence in and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=224.42s)]
*  around the Panama Canal. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=230.5s)]
*  The Panamanians have argued that the Chinese don't run the canal. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=232.98s)]
*  They certainly have some infrastructure projects around the canal, but they argue that they are [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=236.66s)]
*  still in charge. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=242.34s)]
*  Nevertheless, it does sound like the meetings were productive and Rubio heads now to El [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=244.18s)]
*  Salvador where he is going to make the case that officials there need to accept more [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=249.86s)]
*  deported foreign nationals from countries that don't accept U.S. deportation flights. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=256.1s)]
*  So as deportation flights ramp up, one of the challenges is that the U.S. wants to send [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=261.7s)]
*  people back to countries that won't accept those flights. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=268.26s)]
*  They need to go somewhere and so Rubio is going to be leaning on the El Salvadorians [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=271.62s)]
*  to try to take some of those deported individuals. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=275.62s)]
*  And speaking on immigration, Nancy, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is visiting the southern [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=278.26s)]
*  border for his first trip since he was confirmed. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=282.74s)]
*  What role does he play in Trump's mass deportation plan? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=285.94s)]
*  Well, President Trump and those around him are looking for a major influx in the military [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=291.94s)]
*  presence at the U.S. border. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=297.86s)]
*  They believe that would be one way to stem the flow, not just of fentanyl but of migrants [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=299.62s)]
*  themselves crossing the border illegally. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=307.22s)]
*  Traditionally, members of the military, when they are at the border, they don't play an [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=310.66s)]
*  enforcement role. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=315.7s)]
*  They're not out there with their military weapons pointing them at individuals as they [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=316.66s)]
*  cross the border. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=321.54s)]
*  They're usually there in a support role, a supporting role. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=322.34000000000003s)]
*  But the White House would like to beef up that supporting role. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=325.86s)]
*  In fact, there's even been discussion of sending as many as 10,000 troops to the U.S. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=328.98s)]
*  border, which would be really significant. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=334.90000000000003s)]
*  And so doing anything like that would require the complete buy-in and participation of the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=337.62s)]
*  new Secretary of Defense. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=344.18s)]
*  Also happening now, and this one is sending shockwaves through Washington, Nancy. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=346.18s)]
*  Another federal judge hears challenges to the Trump administration's memo that put a [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=349.70000000000005s)]
*  freeze on federal funding assistance. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=354.42s)]
*  Trump's team already rescinded part of that freeze. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=357.21999999999997s)]
*  Can you walk us through what challenges remain in this? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=360.18s)]
*  Sure. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=364.97999999999996s)]
*  I mean, they did freeze the freeze, but they could always unfreeze the freeze. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=365.46s)]
*  In fact, they have said that this is only temporary, that they are reworking the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=369.86s)]
*  instructions now that there are courts involved. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=375.06s)]
*  But they still very much would like to place a freeze on federal spending in particular [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=377.78s)]
*  that conflicts with some of President Trump's executive orders having to do with [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=384.34s)]
*  transgender individuals, having to do with migrants who are in this country illegally [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=389.85999999999996s)]
*  and the like. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=396.97999999999996s)]
*  And so, you know, they are working through some of these legal challenges that have popped up. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=397.78s)]
*  But make no mistake, they are, you know, as you can read into some of the actions we saw this [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=404.41999999999996s)]
*  weekend by Elon Musk and his operation called DOGE, they are looking to cut federal spending [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=409.78s)]
*  any way they can. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=417.94s)]
*  Nancy Cordes, live for us from the White House. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=419.7s)]
*  Thank you so much for that reporting, Nancy. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2593fLDo6bQ&t=421.61999999999995s)]
