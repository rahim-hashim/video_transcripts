# Trump speaks, takes questions at World Economic Forum
**CBS News:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y)
*  Well, thank you very much, Klaus, and hello to everyone in beautiful Davos. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=0.0s)]
*  This has been a truly historic week in the United States. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=10.52s)]
*  Three days ago, I took the oath of office and we began the Golden Age of America. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=14.72s)]
*  The recent presidential election was won by millions of votes and all seven, every one [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=22.0s)]
*  of them, all seven swing states. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=27.12s)]
*  It was a massive mandate from the American people, like hasn't been seen in many years. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=29.96s)]
*  And some of the political pundits, even some of my so-called enemies, said it was the most [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=35.36s)]
*  consequential election victory in 129 years. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  That's quite nice. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=44.68s)]
*  What the world has witnessed in the past 72 hours is nothing less than a revolution of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=46.5s)]
*  common sense. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=51.36s)]
*  Our country will soon be stronger, wealthier, and more united than ever before, and the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  entire planet will be more peaceful and prosperous as a result of this incredible momentum and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=57.44s)]
*  what we're doing and going to do. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=63.92s)]
*  My administration is acting with unprecedented speed to fix the disasters we've inherited [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=67.2s)]
*  from a totally inept group of people and to solve every single crisis facing our country. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=72.86s)]
*  This begins with confronting the economic chaos caused by the failed policies of the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=79.56s)]
*  last administration. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=84.88s)]
*  Over the past four years, our government racked up $8 trillion in wasteful deficit [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=87.22s)]
*  spending and inflicted nation-wrecking energy restrictions, crippling regulations, and hidden [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=92.17999999999999s)]
*  taxes like never before. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=98.1s)]
*  The result is the worst inflation crisis in modern history and sky-high interest rates [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=101.5s)]
*  for our citizens and even throughout the world. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=106.53999999999999s)]
*  Food prices and the price of almost every other thing known to mankind went through [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=110.58s)]
*  the roof. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=115.62s)]
*  President Biden totally lost control of what was going on in our country, but in particular [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=117.58000000000001s)]
*  with our high inflation economy and at our border. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=121.94000000000001s)]
*  Because of these ruinous policies, total government spending this year is $1.5 trillion higher [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=126.58000000000001s)]
*  than was projected to occur when I left office just four years ago. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=132.24s)]
*  Likewise, the cost of servicing the debt is more than 230 percent higher than was projected [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=137.9s)]
*  in 2020. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=144.74s)]
*  The inflation rate we are inheriting remains 50 percent higher than the historic target. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=146.54000000000002s)]
*  It was the highest inflation probably in the history of our country. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=151.82000000000002s)]
*  That's why from the moment I took office, I've taken rapid action to reverse each and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=156.62s)]
*  every one of these radical left policies that created this calamity, in particular with [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=161.5s)]
*  immigration, crime, and inflation. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=167.06s)]
*  On day one, I signed an executive order directing every member of my cabinet to marshal all [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=169.86s)]
*  powers at their disposal to defeat inflation and reduce the cost of daily life. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=174.70000000000002s)]
*  I imposed a federal hiring freeze, a federal regulation freeze, a foreign aid freeze, and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=181.5s)]
*  I created the new Department of Government Efficiency. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=188.38s)]
*  I terminated the ridiculous and incredibly wasteful Green New Deal. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=193.18s)]
*  I call it the Green New Scam. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=198.26s)]
*  I withdrew from the one-sided Paris Climate Accord and ended the insane and costly electric [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=200.42s)]
*  vehicle mandate. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=207.17999999999998s)]
*  We're going to let people buy the car they want to buy. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=208.17999999999998s)]
*  I declared a national energy emergency, and it's so important, national energy emergency [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=211.61999999999998s)]
*  to unlock the liquid gold under our feet and pave the way for rapid approvals of new energy [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=218.33999999999997s)]
*  infrastructure. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=225.42s)]
*  The United States is the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth, and we're [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=226.86s)]
*  going to use it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=231.86s)]
*  Not only will this reduce the cost of virtually all goods and services, it'll make the United [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=233.42000000000002s)]
*  States a manufacturing superpower and the world capital of artificial intelligence and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=238.74s)]
*  crypto. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=245.82000000000002s)]
*  My administration has also begun the largest deregulation campaign in history, far exceeding [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=247.22000000000003s)]
*  the record-setting efforts of my last term. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=253.98000000000002s)]
*  In total, the Biden administration imposed $50,000 in additional regulatory costs on [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=257.98s)]
*  the average American household over the last four years. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=264.18s)]
*  I have promised to eliminate 10 old regulations for every new regulation, which will soon [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=268.78000000000003s)]
*  put many thousands of dollars back in the pockets of American families. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=275.3s)]
*  To further unleash our economy, our majorities in the House and Senate, which we also took [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=280.42s)]
*  along with the presidency, are going to pass the largest tax cut in American history, including [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=286.62s)]
*  massive tax cuts for workers and family, and big tax cuts for domestic producers and manufacturers. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=292.34000000000003s)]
*  And we're working with the Democrats on getting an extension of the original Trump tax cuts, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=300.42s)]
*  as you probably know, by just reading any paper. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=305.86s)]
*  My message to every business in the world is very simple. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=310.42s)]
*  Come make your product in America, and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=314.06s)]
*  nation on earth. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=319.1s)]
*  We're bringing them down very substantially, even from the original Trump tax cuts. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=321.18s)]
*  But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=326.26s)]
*  will have to pay a tariff, differing amounts, but a tariff which will direct hundreds of [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=331.9s)]
*  billions of dollars and even trillions of dollars into our treasury to strengthen our [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=337.5s)]
*  economy and pay down debt. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=342.18s)]
*  Under the Trump administration, there will be no better place on earth to create jobs, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=344.74s)]
*  build factories or grow a company than right here in the good old USA. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=349.34s)]
*  Already Americans economic, you can see this, I think maybe even in your, in your wonderful, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=354.82s)]
*  room that you're all gathered together. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=361.7s)]
*  So many of my friends, but Americans, the economic confidence is soaring like we haven't [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=363.65999999999997s)]
*  seen in many, many decades, maybe not at all. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=369.21999999999997s)]
*  Upon my election, it was just announced a small business optimism skyrocketed by 41 [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=372.98s)]
*  points in a single month. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=379.42s)]
*  That's the highest ever. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=381.1s)]
*  There's never been anything like that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=382.58s)]
*  Softbank has announced between a 100 and $200 billion investment in the US economy because [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=384.62s)]
*  of the election result. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=390.82s)]
*  And just two days ago, Oracle Softbank and OpenAI announced a $500 billion investment [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=392.09999999999997s)]
*  in AI infrastructure. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=398.9s)]
*  Other companies likewise have announced billions and billions and billions, adding up the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=401.54s)]
*  trillions of investment in America, in the United States. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=406.58s)]
*  And it's also reported today in the papers that Saudi Arabia will be investing at least [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=412.06s)]
*  $600 billion in America, but I'll be asking the crown prince, who's a fantastic guy, to [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=418.02s)]
*  round it out to around one trillion. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=423.38s)]
*  I think they'll do that because we've been very good to them. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=425.38s)]
*  And I'm also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=429.21999999999997s)]
*  You got to bring it down, which frankly I'm surprised they didn't do before the election. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=434.05999999999995s)]
*  That didn't show a lot of love by them not doing it. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=438.9s)]
*  I was a little surprised by that. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=441.94s)]
*  If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=444.18s)]
*  Right now, the price is high enough that that war will continue. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=448.62s)]
*  You got to bring down the oil price. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=451.54s)]
*  You got to end that war. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=452.98s)]
*  They should have done it long ago. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=454.74s)]
*  They're very responsible, actually, to a certain extent, for what's taking place. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=456.34000000000003s)]
*  Millions of lives are being lost. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=461.62s)]
*  With oil prices going down, I'll demand that interest rates drop immediately. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=463.86s)]
*  And likewise, they should be dropping all over the world. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=468.06s)]
*  Interest rates should follow us. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=471.14s)]
*  All over the progress that you're seeing is happening because of our historic victory [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=473.18s)]
*  in a recent presidential election, one that has become quite well known throughout the [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=478.7s)]
*  world. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=484.41999999999996s)]
*  I think a lot of things are happening to a lot of countries. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=485.41999999999996s)]
*  They say that there's light shining all over the world since the election. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=487.76s)]
*  And even countries that we aren't particularly friendly with are happy because they understand [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=491.7s)]
*  there is a future and how great the future will be under our leadership. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=499.56s)]
*  America is back and open for business. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=504.0s)]
*  And this week, I'm also taking swift action to stop the invasion at our southern border. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=506.16s)]
*  They allowed people to come in at levels that nobody's ever seen before. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=511.8s)]
*  It was ridiculous. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=515.52s)]
*  I decided and declared to do, and very, very importantly, a national emergency on our border [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=516.96s)]
*  immediately halted all entry of illegal border crossers, of which there were many, and began [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=525.32s)]
*  promptly returning the illegal trespassers back to the place from which they came. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=531.16s)]
*  That action, as you've probably seen, has already started very strongly. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=536.42s)]
*  I've deployed active duty U.S. military and National Guard troops to the border to assist [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=540.48s)]
*  in repelling the invasion. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=546.84s)]
*  It was really an invasion. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=548.96s)]
*  We will not allow our territory to be violated after four long years. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=551.0s)]
*  The United States is strong and sovereign and a beautiful nation. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=556.32s)]
*  Once again, it's a strong, sovereign nation. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=561.04s)]
*  In addition, I'm pleased to report that America is also a free nation. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=564.88s)]
*  Once again, on day one, I signed an executive order to stop all government censorship. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=568.72s)]
*  No longer will our government label the speech of our own citizens as misinformation or disinformation. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=574.6s)]
*  Which are the favorite words of censors and those who wish to stop the free exchange of [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=581.88s)]
*  ideas and frankly progress. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=587.56s)]
*  We have saved free speech in America and we've saved it strongly. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=590.4s)]
*  With another historic executive order this week, I also ended the weaponization of law [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=595.68s)]
*  enforcement against the American people and frankly against politicians and restored the [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=600.0s)]
*  fair, equal and impartial rule of law. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=605.88s)]
*  My administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity and inclusion [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=609.64s)]
*  nonsense and these are policies that were absolute nonsense throughout the government [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=616.4s)]
*  and the private sector. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=621.92s)]
*  With the recent yet somewhat unexpected great Supreme Court decision just made, America [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=623.92s)]
*  will once again become a merit-based country. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=629.76s)]
*  You have to hear that word. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=634.08s)]
*  Merit-based country. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=636.12s)]
*  And I've made it official and official policy of the United States that there are only two [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=638.96s)]
*  genders, male and female. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=644.5600000000001s)]
*  And we will have no men participating in women's sports and transgender operations which became [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=648.4000000000001s)]
*  the rage will occur very rarely. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=655.6800000000001s)]
*  Finally as we restore common sense in America, we're moving quickly to bring back strength [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=659.4000000000001s)]
*  and peace and stability abroad. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=664.36s)]
*  I'm also going to ask all NATO nations to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, which [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=667.32s)]
*  is what it should have been years ago. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=673.48s)]
*  It was only at 2% and most nations didn't pay until I came along. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=676.2s)]
*  I insisted that they pay and they did because the United States was really paying the difference [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=680.64s)]
*  at that time and it was unfair to the United States. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=685.84s)]
*  But many, many things have been unfair for many years to the United States. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=689.32s)]
*  Before even taking office, my team negotiated a ceasefire agreement in the Middle East, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=694.84s)]
*  which wouldn't have happened without us, as I think most of the people in the room know. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=699.48s)]
*  Earlier this week, the hostages began to return to their families. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=705.0s)]
*  They are returning and it's a beautiful sight and they'll be coming in more and more. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=709.72s)]
*  They started coming back on Sunday. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=714.3199999999999s)]
*  Our efforts to secure a peace settlement between Russia and Ukraine are now hopefully underway. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=717.24s)]
*  It's so important to get that done. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=723.24s)]
*  That is an absolute killing field. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=724.84s)]
*  Millions of soldiers are being killed. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=728.2s)]
*  Nobody's seen anything like it since World War II. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=730.76s)]
*  They're laying dead all over the flat fields. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=733.76s)]
*  It's a flat field farmland and there's millions of Russians and millions of Ukrainians. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=736.2800000000001s)]
*  Nobody's seen anything like it since World War II. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=743.32s)]
*  It's time to end it. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=745.84s)]
*  And here in America, we have big events coming up. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=747.36s)]
*  Next year, we have the 250th anniversary of America's founding. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=750.4s)]
*  I'm so honored to be president during that. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=755.04s)]
*  That's been a big event. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=757.32s)]
*  They've been talking about it for 10 years. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=758.72s)]
*  We also have the World Cup. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=761.12s)]
*  And I understand Gianni's in the room, in Fantino. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=763.32s)]
*  He was very instrumental in helping us get it. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=768.28s)]
*  He's there with you someplace, I think. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=771.16s)]
*  And I want to thank him for that. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=773.88s)]
*  And then we have the Olympics coming up, which I was instrumental in getting also in my first term. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=775.32s)]
*  And who would have known that by skipping a term, I would get the Olympics? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=782.0400000000001s)]
*  I was upset. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=785.1600000000001s)]
*  I said, you know, I got the Olympics to come and I won't be president. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=786.0400000000001s)]
*  But it turned out through a stroke of luck or whatever you might call it, that I'm going to be president during the World Cup and the Olympics and the 250th anniversary. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=789.48s)]
*  So that's going to be three big events. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=799.5600000000001s)]
*  And we've accomplished more in less than four days. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=802.44s)]
*  We have really been working four days than other administrations have accomplished in four years. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=805.28s)]
*  And we're just getting started. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=811.5600000000001s)]
*  It's really an amazing thing to see. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=813.0s)]
*  And the spirit and the light over our country has been incredible. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=814.76s)]
*  Under the last administration, our nation has suffered greatly. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=818.48s)]
*  But we're going to bring it back and make it greater, bigger, stronger, better than ever before. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=822.84s)]
*  I want to thank everybody for being with you. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=829.76s)]
*  I would have been there myself, except the inauguration was two days ago. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=832.12s)]
*  I thought it might be a little bit quick to make it the first stop. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=835.5600000000001s)]
*  But we'll get there one day. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=839.2s)]
*  We hope to get there. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=840.64s)]
*  But I do appreciate I heard the audience is fantastic and many of my friends are in the audience. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=841.6s)]
*  And I will be taking questions now from some very distinguished people. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=847.04s)]
*  Thank you all very much. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=851.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=859.2s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. President, for that very powerful speech. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=860.08s)]
*  And I think you could hear the applause all the way from Davos to the White House. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=865.36s)]
*  But next year, it will be even better because then you can get applause here in Davos. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=870.88s)]
*  So we wish you welcome to our village next year. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=875.28s)]
*  We hope to see you. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=877.96s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=880.0s)]
*  So we also know, Mr. President, that you opened up for interaction here. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=881.28s)]
*  We have a great panel with some of the most distinguished business people in the world. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=887.0799999999999s)]
*  Let me start with someone that you know really well that I think is almost a neighbor of you in Florida. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=892.7199999999999s)]
*  Mr. Steve Swartzman, chairman, CEO, and co-founder of Blackstone Group. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=903.56s)]
*  So, Steve, floor is yours. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=909.48s)]
*  Well, Mr. President, I'm sure the crown prince of Saudi Arabia will be really glad you gave this speech today. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=911.68s)]
*  You've had the busiest four days that anybody can imagine, and congratulations for that. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=927.4399999999999s)]
*  Congratulations for that. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=936.24s)]
*  And my question is about some of the things I've observed here at Davos. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=939.5600000000001s)]
*  It's a terrific forum. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=947.76s)]
*  I've met lots of people, as usual. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=950.4s)]
*  I think I've been here 30 years. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=954.12s)]
*  And a lot of the European business people have expressed enormous [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=956.6s)]
*  frustration with the regulatory regime in the EU. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=964.32s)]
*  And they attribute slower growth rates here because of the numerous factors, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=971.1600000000001s)]
*  but especially because of regulations. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=978.8000000000001s)]
*  And you've taken a completely different approach in this area. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=982.7600000000001s)]
*  And if you could explain the theory of what you're doing, how you're going to do it, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=989.28s)]
*  and what you expect the outcome to be, I'd appreciate it. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=997.52s)]
*  Well, thank you very much. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1004.88s)]
*  And congratulations, Steve. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1005.96s)]
*  You're a friend of mine, but on a great career. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1007.64s)]
*  You have had an amazing career and continues. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1009.64s)]
*  I just want to congratulate you. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1012.2s)]
*  Very inspirational to a lot of people. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1013.72s)]
*  I want to talk about the EU, because you mentioned specifically that I have also had a lot of [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1016.8000000000001s)]
*  friends and leaders of countries. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1023.6800000000001s)]
*  I got to know them all my first term and a little bit during this period of four years. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1025.24s)]
*  And know them well, like them a lot, but they're very frustrated because of the time [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1030.56s)]
*  everything seems to take to get approved, environmental impact statements for things [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1036.16s)]
*  that you shouldn't even have to do that and many, many other ways that it takes. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1041.24s)]
*  And I'm going to give you a quick little example. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1045.92s)]
*  I were in the private life, my beautiful private life, before I had all these things happening. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1047.7600000000002s)]
*  The world is a little different. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1053.1200000000001s)]
*  I had a nice, simple life. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1054.96s)]
*  You knew that. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1056.0400000000002s)]
*  But when I had that simple life, I did projects and I had a big project in Ireland and it [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1057.2s)]
*  had to get approval on something that would have made it even better. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1064.88s)]
*  And I got the approval from Ireland in a period of a week. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1069.44s)]
*  And it was a very, very, very efficient, good approval. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1073.88s)]
*  And they informed me, though, the problem is you're going to have to get it from the EU. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1078.6000000000001s)]
*  And we think that'll take five to six years. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1082.2s)]
*  And I said, you have to be kidding. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1085.24s)]
*  And this was before politics. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1087.72s)]
*  And I said, wait a minute, it's not that important. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1091.0800000000002s)]
*  I don't want to go five or six years, but it would have been a big investment. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1093.3600000000001s)]
*  It would have been nice. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1096.2s)]
*  It would have been good for the project. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1097.1200000000001s)]
*  And I sent the people to the EU to see if they could speed it up. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1101.0s)]
*  And basically, it was a five or six year wait just to get a simple approval that Ireland [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1104.08s)]
*  gave me in a period of literally not much more than a week. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1109.1999999999998s)]
*  And I realized right then, that was the first time I really was involved with the EU. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1113.3999999999999s)]
*  But I realized right then that's a problem. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1118.32s)]
*  And I didn't even bother applying to do it. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1121.32s)]
*  And or if I did, I pulled it very quickly. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1125.32s)]
*  I have to be very accurate because I don't want to be criticized. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1127.84s)]
*  He did apply actually. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1131.48s)]
*  Now I want to be very accurate. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1133.08s)]
*  So I don't think I did. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1135.0s)]
*  But if I did, I pulled it very quickly. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1136.8s)]
*  It was just something you couldn't wait five years or six years to get an approval. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1138.24s)]
*  So a lot of in a very big business sense, a lot of people are claiming that's the problem. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1142.44s)]
*  From the standpoint of America, the EU treats us very, very unfairly, very badly. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1148.9199999999998s)]
*  They have a large tax that we know about and a VAT tax. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1156.04s)]
*  And it's a very substantial one. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1162.48s)]
*  They don't take our essentially don't take our farm products and they don't take our cars. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1165.12s)]
*  Yet they send cars to us by the millions. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1169.56s)]
*  They put tariffs on things that we want to do. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1173.76s)]
*  Like, for instance, I think they actually in terms of these are non economic or non [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1177.32s)]
*  monetary tariffs, and those are very bad and they make it very difficult to bring products [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1184.0s)]
*  into Europe. And yet they expect to be selling and they do sell their products in the United [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1190.28s)]
*  States. So we have, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars of deficits with the EU [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1194.88s)]
*  and nobody's happy with it. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1200.32s)]
*  And we're going to do something about it, but nobody's happy with it. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1201.72s)]
*  So I think the EU has to speed up their process. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1204.36s)]
*  Friends of mine that are in some of the nations within the EU, great people, they [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1208.12s)]
*  want to be able to compete better. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1214.64s)]
*  And you can't compete when you can't get go through the approval process fast. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1216.24s)]
*  There's no reason why it can't go faster. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1221.12s)]
*  So, you know, I'm I'm trying to be constructive because I love Europe. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1223.48s)]
*  I love the countries of Europe, but the process is a very cumbersome one. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1229.04s)]
*  And they do treat the United States of America very, very unfairly with the VAT taxes and all of [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1234.24s)]
*  the other taxes they impose. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1242.0s)]
*  One other just to finish up, I got a call from the head of a major airline, one of the [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1244.76s)]
*  biggest airlines in the world. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1249.4s)]
*  And he said, Sir, could you help us? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1250.88s)]
*  What landing in Europe is brutal. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1253.6s)]
*  They charge us fees for everything. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1256.28s)]
*  And it's so unfair. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1259.0s)]
*  I said, how does it compare to China? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1260.36s)]
*  He said it's it's much worse. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1262.96s)]
*  And the other thing, as you know, they took court cases with Apple and they supposedly [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1266.2800000000002s)]
*  won a case that most people didn't think was much of a case. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1274.24s)]
*  They won 15 or 16 billion from Apple. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1277.6000000000001s)]
*  They won billions from Google. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1280.64s)]
*  I think they're after Facebook for billions and billions. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1282.76s)]
*  These are American companies, whether you like them or not, they're American companies and [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1285.5200000000002s)]
*  they shouldn't be doing that. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1289.88s)]
*  And that's as far as I'm concerned, it's a form of taxation. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1291.76s)]
*  So we have some very big complaints with the EU. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1295.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1300.04s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. President. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1303.28s)]
*  Will no go to one of your friends in the EU, Patrick Poyanna. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1305.6s)]
*  He's the chairman CEO of Total Energies. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1312.56s)]
*  I guess you have a question ready, Patrick, for the president. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1316.56s)]
*  Mr. President, as we understand, energy is at the top of your agenda. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1322.12s)]
*  And it's an honor for me to represent the energy industry tonight in this panel. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1327.4799999999998s)]
*  Total Energies is indeed the fourth largest oil and gas and electricity company in the world. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1331.8799999999999s)]
*  I will not ask you a question about the oil price. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1337.1999999999998s)]
*  It's quite clear what you expect from us. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1339.56s)]
*  I will no go to gas more. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1342.12s)]
*  And our company is the largest number one exporter LNG from the US company. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1344.5200000000002s)]
*  We are a strong contributor to and we invest in MAMUF LNG projects in Texas, $20 billion. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1354.92s)]
*  It's far from $200, but it's $20 billion. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1362.7600000000002s)]
*  And we contribute with that to security of supply to Europe as we export this LNG to Europe. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1365.72s)]
*  Some experts fear that if there are too many projects developed in the US on LNG, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1372.84s)]
*  this could have an inflationary impact on the US domestic gas price. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1379.7199999999998s)]
*  And they recommend a pause on these projects. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1385.7199999999998s)]
*  I would ask you the following question. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1389.8s)]
*  What are your views on about such a pause on investments on LNG in the US? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1391.56s)]
*  What would happen if you would observe an increased domestic gas price because of these exports? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1397.32s)]
*  And final question, which is important for Europe. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1404.6s)]
*  Would you agree to guarantee security of supplies of US LNG to Europe? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1408.4399999999998s)]
*  Well, in the last part of your question, yes, I would. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1415.6399999999999s)]
*  I would make sure that you get it. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1418.4399999999998s)]
*  If we make a deal, we make a deal. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1420.1999999999998s)]
*  You'll get it because a lot of people do have that problem. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1421.56s)]
*  They make a deal and then it can't get supplied because of war type problems and other problems. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1424.1999999999998s)]
*  So we would absolutely do that. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1429.3999999999999s)]
*  LNG is very interesting because when I took office for the first term, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1432.12s)]
*  one of the first things I looked at was two, there were two very massive plants in Louisiana, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1436.28s)]
*  state that has been very good to me, one by many, many points. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1443.56s)]
*  And I felt strongly indebted to it, actually. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1446.6s)]
*  And they said there are two plants that have been under environmental consideration for more than 10 [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1450.6s)]
*  years and they were costing, as you say, you know how expensive those plants are, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1455.72s)]
*  but they were costing like 12 billion and I think 14 or 15 billion, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1460.44s)]
*  but they couldn't get their permits. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1465.24s)]
*  They were in review for years, many, many years, like a decade or more. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1467.24s)]
*  And I said, so ridiculous. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1474.44s)]
*  I know so much about that because in the construction industry, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1476.2s)]
*  I had to go through it too, but I got good at it after a while. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1479.08s)]
*  But I went, I saw the projects and you're talking about a total investment of 25 to 30 billion [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1482.6s)]
*  dollars and it looked like it was going to end. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1490.36s)]
*  They couldn't get their permits and I got them done in less than a week. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1492.1999999999998s)]
*  It was done, completed. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1497.3999999999999s)]
*  In fact, when they called them to announce that it was done, the countries, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1498.6s)]
*  largely countries, Japan was involved and another country and some very big investors, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1504.12s)]
*  they couldn't believe it. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1510.04s)]
*  They actually couldn't believe it. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1511.1599999999999s)]
*  And I said, just do yourself one favor. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1512.36s)]
*  Don't pay any consultants because the only one that got it done was me. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1514.6s)]
*  I got it done because it was the right thing to do for the US and for the world, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1517.8799999999999s)]
*  but the consultants had nothing to do with it. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1521.72s)]
*  You know, the consultants go in and they say, give us millions of dollars because [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1523.72s)]
*  Trump did it. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1527.32s)]
*  Nobody called me about it. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1528.2s)]
*  I just heard it was a problem for years and I got it done because it was the right [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1529.3999999999999s)]
*  thing to do for the US and the right thing to do for beyond. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1533.4s)]
*  It had to do with energy. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1536.68s)]
*  Very important. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1537.8000000000002s)]
*  So I think it's very important. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1538.8400000000001s)]
*  I think the, you know, I disagree with one. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1540.6000000000001s)]
*  I think the more that you do, the lower the price is going to go. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1543.24s)]
*  And what I'd like to see is rapid approvals. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1547.24s)]
*  We're going to give very rapid approvals in the United States, like with the AI [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1549.88s)]
*  plans talking to many people want to build them. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1553.3200000000002s)]
*  That's going to be a very big thing. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1557.24s)]
*  We're going to build electric generating facilities. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1559.72s)]
*  They are going to build. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1563.48s)]
*  I'm going to get them the approval under emergency declaration. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1564.52s)]
*  I can get the approvals done myself without having to go through years of waiting. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1568.04s)]
*  And the big problem is we need double the energy we currently have in the United States. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1572.76s)]
*  Can you imagine for AI to really be as big as we want to have it? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1576.84s)]
*  Because it's a very competitive. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1582.4399999999998s)]
*  It'll be very competitive with China and others. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1583.8799999999999s)]
*  So I'm going to give emergency declaration so that they can start building them almost [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1586.6s)]
*  immediately. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1591.0s)]
*  And I'm I'm I think it was largely my idea because nobody thought this was possible. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1592.04s)]
*  It wasn't that they were not smart because they're the smartest. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1597.0s)]
*  But I told them that what I want you to do is build your electric generating plant right [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1600.84s)]
*  next to your plant as a separate building connected. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1605.8s)]
*  And they said, wow, you're kidding. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1608.92s)]
*  And I said, no, no, I'm not kidding. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1611.24s)]
*  You don't have to hook into the grid, which is old and, you know, could be taken out. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1613.8s)]
*  If it's taken out, they wouldn't have any way to get any electricity. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1618.4399999999998s)]
*  So we are going to allow them to go on a very rapid base basis to build their plant, build [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1624.36s)]
*  the electric generating plant. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1631.1599999999999s)]
*  They can fuel it with anything they want. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1632.76s)]
*  And they may have coal as a backup. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1635.48s)]
*  Good clean coal. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1637.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, if there were a problem with a with a pipe coming in, as an example, you're going [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1639.0s)]
*  with gas, oil, gas, and a pipe gets blown up or for some reason, does it work? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1644.12s)]
*  There are some companies in the U.S. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1650.28s)]
*  That have coal sitting right by the plant so that if there's an emergency, they can go [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1652.12s)]
*  to that short term basis and use our very clean coal. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1659.64s)]
*  So that's something else that a lot of people didn't even know about. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1663.72s)]
*  But nothing can destroy called not the weather, not a bomb, nothing. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1666.36s)]
*  It might make it a little smaller, might make it a little different shape. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1671.8s)]
*  But coal is very strong as a backup. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1676.84s)]
*  It's a great backup to have that facility and it wouldn't cost much more money. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1679.1599999999999s)]
*  And we have more coal than anybody. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1683.56s)]
*  We also have more oil and gas than anybody. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1685.7199999999998s)]
*  So we're going to make it so that the plants will have their own electric generating facilities [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1688.28s)]
*  attached right to their plant. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1693.56s)]
*  They don't have to worry about a utility. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1695.32s)]
*  They don't have to worry about anything. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1697.08s)]
*  And we're going to get very rapid approvals. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1698.4399999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1702.76s)]
*  Thank you so much, Mr. President. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1703.3999999999999s)]
*  We'll now go to another CEO that you know very well, Brian Monahan, the CEO and chair [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1705.0s)]
*  of Bank of America. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1712.84s)]
*  Good afternoon, Mr. President. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1715.32s)]
*  And congratulations and obviously a eventful week for you and your family. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1716.76s)]
*  If you remember five years ago, you came here and we walked among 150 CEOs from all [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1721.24s)]
*  over the world and you engaged with them about your policies and your procedures. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1725.72s)]
*  This year you're not here, and yet this week was eventful from the orders that you mentioned [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1731.0s)]
*  earlier, literally a wave of orders coming out on immigration, on trade, and many other [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1735.32s)]
*  matters. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1741.16s)]
*  And so as a representative of the United States here, we got a lot of questions about what [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1741.96s)]
*  does all this mean and how would the president square this with his clear focus on growth, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1747.96s)]
*  prosperity, market growth, stock market growth, a good bond market, and bringing down prices. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1753.4s)]
*  So how do you think about the impact of all these orders and how fast they come out and [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1759.56s)]
*  how you're going to balance them with that scorecard of being successful in both continuing [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1763.88s)]
*  GDP growth, bringing down inflation, and also having a good stock price appreciation for [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1769.4s)]
*  the American citizen? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1774.2s)]
*  Well, I think it's going to actually bring down inflation. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1775.08s)]
*  It's going to bring up jobs. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1779.3999999999999s)]
*  We're going to have a lot of jobs. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1780.76s)]
*  We're going to have a lot of companies. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1781.8s)]
*  We'll begin, you know, Brian, we're at 21%. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1783.0s)]
*  It was at 40%. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1786.04s)]
*  And I got it down to 21%. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1787.1599999999999s)]
*  The corporate tax. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1789.0s)]
*  And it was actually, if you look at state and city, it was in many cases much higher [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1790.52s)]
*  than 40%. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1794.28s)]
*  I got it down to 21%. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1795.1599999999999s)]
*  And now we're going to bring it down from 21% to 15%. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1797.3999999999999s)]
*  If there's a big if, if you make your product in the U.S. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1800.6799999999998s)]
*  So we're going to have the lowest just about the lowest rate. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1804.04s)]
*  It'll be the 21 is on the low side worldwide. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1806.36s)]
*  The 15 is about as low as it gets. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1810.28s)]
*  And by far the lowest of a large country, a large, you know, rich, powerful country [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1813.1599999999999s)]
*  by far, not even a contest. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1818.04s)]
*  So we're going to bring it down to 15% if you make your product in the USA. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1819.48s)]
*  So that's going to create a tremendous buzz. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1825.32s)]
*  We're also probably going back to the one year deduction where we deduct, you know, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1827.8799999999999s)]
*  we did that originally and that was amazing what the impact that that had the one year [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1833.0s)]
*  deduction, which built up over a period of time and then it expires. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1838.84s)]
*  But we're going to go back to that when we do the renewal of the Trump tax plan, we have [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1843.88s)]
*  to get Democrats to approve it. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1848.44s)]
*  But, you know, if the Democrats didn't approve it, I don't know how they can survive with [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1849.96s)]
*  about a 45% tax increase because that's what it would be. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1854.76s)]
*  And so I think they're going to be what we've been working along with them pretty well. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1858.36s)]
*  I think it's very hard for a political group to say let's charge people 45% more. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1863.32s)]
*  So I think we're in good shape, but we're actually doing a reduction for business and [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1868.12s)]
*  small businesses where you're going to bring it down to 15%, which is really something. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1871.8s)]
*  And by the way, speaking of you, and you've done a fantastic job, but I hope you start [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1879.0s)]
*  opening your bank to conservatives because many conservatives complain that the banks [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1883.96s)]
*  are not allowing them to do business within the bank. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1888.44s)]
*  And that included a place called Bank of America. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1891.16s)]
*  This conservative, they don't take conservative business. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1894.04s)]
*  And I don't know if the regulators mandated that because of Biden or what, but you and [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1897.0800000000002s)]
*  Jamie and everybody, I hope you're going to open your banks to conservatives because [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1902.28s)]
*  what you're doing is wrong. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1905.8s)]
*  Mr. President, I'll say that your friend Gianni was said hello, told me to tell you [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1906.92s)]
*  hello. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1913.96s)]
*  And we look forward to sponsoring the World Cup when it comes both this summer for the [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1914.44s)]
*  club and next year. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1919.24s)]
*  So thank you for getting after the United States. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1920.04s)]
*  The President Thank you very much, Brian. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1921.72s)]
*  Mr. President, we'll now go to Anna Abutin. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1923.96s)]
*  She's the executive chairman of Banco Santander, one of the big European banks, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1929.0s)]
*  and also in the U.S. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1935.4s)]
*  So Anna. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1936.52s)]
*  Anna Abutin Mr. President, congratulations on a historic victory. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1937.24s)]
*  I believe you don't know me as well as my fellow panelists. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1942.8400000000001s)]
*  So a few words. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1945.8000000000002s)]
*  Santander is one of the largest banks in the world by number of customers, 170 million. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1947.24s)]
*  That's more than my friend Brian or my friend Jamie have. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1953.3200000000002s)]
*  And those. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1958.68s)]
*  Mr. President They fix the regulations. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1959.16s)]
*  Anna Abutin That's coming. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1964.7600000000002s)]
*  That's coming. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1966.68s)]
*  Mr. President That was cheeky. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1967.0800000000002s)]
*  Anna Abutin We are a big investor in the United States. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1968.92s)]
*  We have many million customers, 12,000 employees. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1972.36s)]
*  We're one of the largest auto lenders. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1975.6399999999999s)]
*  And we recently launched a fully digital bank called Open Bank. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1977.96s)]
*  We strongly believe banks have a pivotal role in the economy and we can accelerate growth [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1982.44s)]
*  and help many more customers. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1988.2s)]
*  That's what we're doing in the United States. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1989.96s)]
*  So as Brian pointed out, we very much welcome your focus on deregulation and reducing bureaucracy. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=1992.36s)]
*  So my question is, what are your priorities in this regard? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2000.9199999999998s)]
*  And how fast is this going to happen? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2005.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2007.56s)]
*  President Trump I think it's going to thank you and [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2008.28s)]
*  congratulations. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2010.52s)]
*  I know very much about your bank and you've done a fantastic job. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2011.3999999999999s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2015.8s)]
*  We are going to move very quickly. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2017.56s)]
*  We've moved very quickly. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2020.12s)]
*  We've done things in the last three days that nobody thought were possible to do in years. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2021.4s)]
*  And it's all taken. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2027.24s)]
*  It's all taking effect. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2029.4s)]
*  It's going to have a huge impact on the economy, a huge positive impact. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2031.0s)]
*  Money was being wasted on crazy things. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2034.2800000000002s)]
*  I mean, the Green New Deal was such a total disgrace. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2037.72s)]
*  How that was perpetrated. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2042.2800000000002s)]
*  And it was conceived of by people that were average students, less than average students, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2043.88s)]
*  I might add, and never even took a course in energy or the environment. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2049.24s)]
*  It was just a game. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2055.3999999999996s)]
*  Remember the world was going to end in 12 years. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2056.3599999999997s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2059.0s)]
*  Well, the 12 years has come and gone. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2059.4799999999996s)]
*  It was going to end. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2061.08s)]
*  It was going to all foam into earth. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2061.8799999999997s)]
*  But you know, the time has come. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2065.3999999999996s)]
*  These people, and they really scared the Democrats large. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2066.8399999999997s)]
*  I can't say the Republicans. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2074.12s)]
*  Republicans maybe could have fought harder to stop it. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2075.72s)]
*  But it's been a tremendous waste of money. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2078.84s)]
*  During my four years, we had the cleanest air, we had the cleanest water, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2082.92s)]
*  and yet we had the most productive economy in the history of our country. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2086.92s)]
*  We had the most productive economy until COVID came. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2089.96s)]
*  We had the most productive in the history of our country by far. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2094.1200000000003s)]
*  And actually, you could look worldwide. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2097.7200000000003s)]
*  We were beating everybody from China to everybody else. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2102.2000000000003s)]
*  And we think we really now, with what we have learned and all of the other things that have [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2105.56s)]
*  taken place, we think we can even far surpass that. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2112.36s)]
*  Actually far, far surpass it. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2116.44s)]
*  But one thing we're going to be demanding is we're going to be demanding respect from [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2118.6s)]
*  other nations. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2123.7200000000003s)]
*  Canada, we have a tremendous deficit with Canada. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2125.2400000000002s)]
*  We're not going to have that anymore. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2128.04s)]
*  We can't do it. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2129.32s)]
*  I don't know if it's good for them. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2130.84s)]
*  As you probably know, I say you can always become a state. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2132.92s)]
*  And if you're a state, we won't have a deficit, we won't have to tariff you, etc., etc. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2136.28s)]
*  But Canada has been very tough to deal with over the years. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2140.6s)]
*  And it's not fair that we should have a $200 billion or $250 billion deficit. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2144.44s)]
*  We don't need them to make our cars and they make a lot of them. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2150.2s)]
*  We don't need their lumber because we have our own forests, etc., etc. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2153.4s)]
*  We don't need their oil and gas. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2157.0s)]
*  We have our we have more than anybody. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2158.44s)]
*  So, you know, just as an example, with Mexico, we're dealing with Mexico, I think very well. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2161.2400000000002s)]
*  And we're just, you know, we just want to be treated fairly with other nations because [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2167.88s)]
*  there's hardly a nation in the world. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2173.32s)]
*  And I blame this on us and I blame it on politicians that, for some reason, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2176.44s)]
*  I'm probably mostly at stupidity, but you could also say other reasons, but mostly stupidity. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2182.36s)]
*  They've allowed other nations to take advantage of the U.S. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2188.44s)]
*  So we can't allow that to happen anymore. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2191.88s)]
*  You know, we have debt. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2194.2000000000003s)]
*  It's a very small debt when you compare it to value, the value of the assets that we have. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2195.48s)]
*  But we don't want to do that. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2200.44s)]
*  We want to just have debt be obliterated and we'll be able to do that fairly rapidly. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2201.96s)]
*  And a lot of good things are going to happen. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2208.76s)]
*  And honestly, good things are going to happen for the world and good things are going to happen [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2210.92s)]
*  for the people that are dealing with us. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2215.08s)]
*  Allies and beyond allies. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2217.56s)]
*  One thing very important, I really would like to be able to meet with President Putin soon [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2219.72s)]
*  and get that war ended. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2224.92s)]
*  And that's not from the standpoint of economy or anything else. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2226.6s)]
*  It's from the standpoint of millions of lives are being wasted. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2230.2s)]
*  Beautiful young people are being shot in the battlefield. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2234.04s)]
*  You know, the bullet, very flat land, as I said, and the bullet goes, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2237.96s)]
*  there's no there's no hiding in a bullet. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2243.24s)]
*  The only thing going to stop the bullet is a human body. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2245.48s)]
*  And you have to see I've seen pictures of what's taking place. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2248.76s)]
*  It's a carnage. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2252.2s)]
*  And we really have to stop that war. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2253.16s)]
*  That war is horrible. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2255.4s)]
*  And I'm not talking economy. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2256.76s)]
*  I'm not talking economics. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2258.12s)]
*  I'm not talking about natural resource. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2259.56s)]
*  I'm just talking about there's so many young people being killed in this war. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2261.88s)]
*  And that's not including the people that have been killed as the cities are being, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2266.92s)]
*  you know, knocked down building by building. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2271.48s)]
*  So we really should get that stopped. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2273.64s)]
*  Likewise, in the Middle East, I think we've made a lot of progress in the Middle East. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2276.6s)]
*  And I think that's going to that's going to come along pretty well. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2280.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2285.16s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2285.7999999999997s)]
*  We know that the most consequential relationship in the world is between the U.S. and China. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2287.0s)]
*  U.S. 28 percent of the global economy, China close to 20. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2293.8799999999997s)]
*  That's almost half of the global GDP. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2298.6s)]
*  And we know that you called President Xi Jinping last Friday. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2301.16s)]
*  We heard that you had a good discussion. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2307.0s)]
*  How do you see the relationship between the U.S. and China in the next four years [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2309.16s)]
*  under your leadership? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2314.12s)]
*  He called me, but I see it very good. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2317.0s)]
*  I think that we're going to have a very good relationship. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2321.16s)]
*  All we want is fairness. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2326.2799999999997s)]
*  We just want a level playing field. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2327.56s)]
*  We don't want to take advantage. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2329.24s)]
*  We've been having massive deficits with China. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2330.52s)]
*  Biden allowed it to get out of hand. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2335.0s)]
*  He's one point one trillion dollar deficits. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2336.6s)]
*  Ridiculous. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2339.64s)]
*  And it's just an unfair relationship. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2341.0s)]
*  And we have to make it just fair. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2343.72s)]
*  We don't have to make it phenomenal. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2345.32s)]
*  We have to make it a fair relationship. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2346.92s)]
*  Right now, it's not a fair relationship. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2348.84s)]
*  The deficit is massive, as it is with other countries, a lot of Asian countries, actually. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2351.48s)]
*  But we have deficits that are very big. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2356.6s)]
*  We can't keep doing that, so we're not going to keep doing that. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2359.0s)]
*  But I like President Xi very much. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2362.28s)]
*  I've always liked him. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2365.48s)]
*  We always had a very good relationship. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2366.36s)]
*  It was very strained with covid coming out of Wuhan. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2368.52s)]
*  Obviously, that strained it. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2372.28s)]
*  I'm sure it strained it with a lot of people, but that strained our relationship. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2373.64s)]
*  But we always had a great relationship, I would say. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2378.84s)]
*  And we look forward to doing very well with China and getting along with China. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2381.96s)]
*  Hopefully, China can help us stop the war with, in particular, Russia, Ukraine. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2386.52s)]
*  They have a great deal of power over that situation. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2391.1600000000003s)]
*  And we'll work with them. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2394.84s)]
*  And I mentioned that with during our phone conversation with President Xi. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2396.6800000000003s)]
*  And hopefully, we could work together and get that stop. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2401.08s)]
*  We'd like to see denuclearization. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2404.36s)]
*  In fact, with President Putin prior to an election result, which was frankly ridiculous, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2406.84s)]
*  we were talking about denuclearization of our two countries and China would have come along. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2413.88s)]
*  China has a much smaller right now nuclear armament than us or field than us, but they're [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2419.88s)]
*  going to be catching it at some point over the next four or five years. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2427.96s)]
*  And I will tell you that President Putin really liked the idea of cutting way back on nuclear. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2431.32s)]
*  And I think the rest of the world, we would have gotten them to follow. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2439.56s)]
*  And China would have come along to China also liked it. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2442.92s)]
*  Tremendous amounts of money are being spent on nuclear. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2446.2000000000003s)]
*  And the destructive capability is something that we don't even want to talk about today [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2449.7200000000003s)]
*  because you don't want to hear it's too depressing. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2454.92s)]
*  So we want to see if we can denuclearize. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2457.56s)]
*  And I think that's very possible. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2460.52s)]
*  And I can tell you that President Putin wanted to do it. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2462.92s)]
*  He and I wanted to do it. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2465.4s)]
*  We had a good conversation with China. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2467.64s)]
*  They would have been involved. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2471.0s)]
*  And that would have been an unbelievable thing for the planet. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2472.6s)]
*  Mr. President, when you're back carrying doubles next year, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2477.4s)]
*  will there be then a peace agreement with Ukraine and Russia by then? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2481.0s)]
*  Well, you're going to have to ask Russia. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2487.24s)]
*  Ukraine is ready to make a deal. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2489.16s)]
*  Just so you understand, this is a war that should have never started. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2492.44s)]
*  If I were president, it would never have started. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2494.8399999999997s)]
*  This is a war that should have never, ever been started. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2497.56s)]
*  And it wasn't started during my... [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2501.56s)]
*  There was never even talk about it. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2503.4s)]
*  I knew that it was the apple of President Putin's eye, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2505.08s)]
*  but I also knew that there was no way he was going in and he wasn't going to go in. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2508.52s)]
*  And then when I was out, bad things happened, bad things were said, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2513.08s)]
*  a lot of stupidity all around, and you end up with what you have. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2520.92s)]
*  Now you have all these bombed out cities. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2523.96s)]
*  They look like demolition sites with many people killed. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2525.7200000000003s)]
*  I think the thing that you'll see about Ukraine is that far more people have died [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2529.32s)]
*  than is being reported. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2534.6000000000004s)]
*  And I've seen that, but far, far more people have died. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2536.84s)]
*  When you look at a city that's become a demolition site, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2540.2000000000003s)]
*  where big buildings have been collapsed by missiles hitting them and everything else, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2543.4s)]
*  and they say one person was slightly injured. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2548.6800000000003s)]
*  No, no, many people were killed. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2552.28s)]
*  Those are big buildings. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2554.1200000000003s)]
*  I was surprised at how that was my business. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2555.32s)]
*  These are buildings that go two and three blocks long. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2558.3599999999997s)]
*  They're 20 stories high. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2560.6s)]
*  They're big, powerful buildings, and they were knocked down, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2562.2s)]
*  and there were a lot of people in those buildings that announced that two people were injured. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2564.68s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2569.3199999999997s)]
*  So I think you're going to find that there were many more people killed in Ukraine [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2570.6s)]
*  in the Ukraine War than anybody has any idea. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2574.04s)]
*  But if you look now, so many of the people being killed are soldiers [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2576.92s)]
*  just facing each other with guns, rifles, and drones, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2581.8799999999997s)]
*  the new form of warfare drones. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2585.48s)]
*  And it's a very sad thing to see. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2588.12s)]
*  And when you see pictures of the fields that I see, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2589.88s)]
*  nobody wants to see it. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2593.88s)]
*  You'll never be the same. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2595.08s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. President, on behalf of all the 3,000 participants here in Davos. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2598.52s)]
*  We really, really underline that joining us the third day in your presidency, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2606.52s)]

*  This is the first major international speech that he's made since being elected president. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2622.0400000000004s)]
*  Just a couple of the headlines that come out of this. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2627.88s)]
*  He talked a lot about reversing inflation and boosting fossil fuel production [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2630.1200000000003s)]
*  here in the United States. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2635.1600000000003s)]
*  And for the majority of the first part of his address, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2636.36s)]
*  he talked about some of the things that he's accomplished. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2639.4s)]
*  His words in the last few days or so calling it the revolution of common sense. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2641.96s)]
*  He was addressing a high inflation economy. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2647.7200000000003s)]
*  A couple of the other headlines, though, it's important to note that he [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2651.1600000000003s)]
*  his message to other countries was come make your product in the U.S. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2654.6s)]
*  And they're going to get a tax break. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2658.92s)]
*  If they don't make their product in the U.S., they will have to pay in the form of tariffs. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2660.76s)]
*  He also mentioned in his address that Saudi Arabia and OPEC [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2665.4s)]
*  should bring down the cost of oil. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2668.84s)]
*  And if they do that, he says that will end the war in Ukraine between Ukraine and Russia. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2670.28s)]
*  We're going to have much more on the president's address [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2675.7200000000003s)]
*  to the World Economic Forum when we come back. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GppN_Srnn0Y&t=2678.28s)]
