# Trump's birthright citizenship executive order in court
**CBS News:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ)
*  happening right now, and it is a battle to watch multiple states and some U. S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=0.0s)]
*  cities suing president of the United States of his executive order ending [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=6.0s)]
*  something called birthright citizenship. Their argument, a person born in the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=10.48s)]
*  United States is a citizen of the United States, and it's long been protected [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=14.6s)]
*  under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. So hearing just got [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=18.44s)]
*  underway moments ago in a Seattle federal courtroom challenging that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=22.22s)]
*  So we are watching what happens there, but to go deeper on what is happening in [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=26.8s)]
*  that courtroom and the issue at large. Let's go to immigration attorney Margaret [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=31.0s)]
*  Stock. Margaret, I'm also fascinated to get your perspective as a retired U. S [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=34.24s)]
*  Army Lieutenant Colonel. What do we expect from that hearing today? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=38.24s)]
*  Well, we should hear pretty quickly whether the executive order is gonna be [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  paused while the judge considers the legal issues underlying the arguments. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  So we should know that pretty quickly. So the arguments get made restraining [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=52.08s)]
*  orders. The arguments get made, and it's either pause or it's not. If it's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=57.08s)]
*  paused, you say restraining orders. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=61.44s)]
*  Yeah, they'll issue a temporary restraining order, and then eventually [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=64.24s)]
*  they may issue an injunction and a permanent injunction, and it's likely to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=67.52s)]
*  be a nationwide or universal injunction. You know, when you make an argument [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=70.8s)]
*  that's based on the contents of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, one [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=75.08s)]
*  would think that you have a pretty strong argument as somebody who argues [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=79.16s)]
*  these cases and looks at these cases. How are you gonna call this at this [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=83.28s)]
*  hour? I'm calling it for the plaintiffs. The executive order. First of all, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=86.44s)]
*  it's very badly drafted. It looks like somebody who wasn't an attorney or [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=92.32s)]
*  didn't know anything about constitutional law drafted it. It's very [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=96.28s)]
*  poorly drafted, and the president just doesn't have power to change the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=101.8s)]
*  Constitution or a constitutional amendment. He never had that power, and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=105.56s)]
*  the plaintiffs said it pretty well in the complaint. They lay that out. They [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  go, the president doesn't have the power to change the Constitution on his own. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=112.68s)]
*  He just can't do that. And this has been the law of the land. It's actually [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=115.64s)]
*  been the law of the land since the founding of our country, but it was put [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=119.0s)]
*  in writing in the Constitution in the 14th Amendment. So what would have to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=122.84s)]
*  change? What would have to happen to change the 14th Amendment? Because I [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=127.72s)]
*  can imagine if Donald Trump has a loss in court today, like you say, if those [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=131.2s)]
*  restraining orders happen, he's going to want to push against the powers that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=135.16s)]
*  are holding him back. Well, he's been claiming he's going to do this to the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=138.56s)]
*  people that support him, and so he has to feed them something to carry out his [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=143.16s)]
*  promise. But the executive order is not a serious order. It actually doesn't [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=147.84s)]
*  define who's a citizen or not in it. It just gives a couple of examples of [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=152.64s)]
*  people that he thinks aren't citizens. And if you go back and look at the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  history of this argument, basically, Donald Trump himself is not a citizen [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=160.32s)]
*  under the theory that the folks have of the 14th Amendment. So they're not [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=165.28s)]
*  serious about this because they'd be taking citizenship away from millions of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=168.88s)]
*  American citizens, including Marco Rubio and Donald Trump and Nikki Haley and a [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=172.68s)]
*  whole bunch of other people. So to me, it's what we used to call in the Army [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  a dog and pony show for people. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=181.6s)]
*  So you are retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel. And so because you also have [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=183.88s)]
*  that expertise, I want to ask you your reaction to the reporting. 1500 troops [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=187.92s)]
*  being sent to the southern border. It could expand to 10,000 troops as [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=192.6s)]
*  somebody who has sort of that dual perspective of an attorney, an [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=196.92s)]
*  immigration attorney and also with your history in the Army. And by the way, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=199.88s)]
*  thank you for your service. What are your thoughts about boosting those [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=203.27999999999997s)]
*  troops? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=205.88s)]
*  Well, it's gonna take a lot of training. People in the Army don't sign up to be [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=207.44s)]
*  border agents. They sign up to do things like be infantry or, you know, be a [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=210.67999999999998s)]
*  combat medic or things like that. And so they're just not trained on how to [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=215.32s)]
*  handle border issues. And it's gonna take a lot of training and a lot of [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  budget money. And Congress is gonna need to come up with the money to support [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=221.92s)]
*  this. And then we're gonna need just a huge amount of training for the troops. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  Margaret Stock, we appreciate the conversation once again for our viewers [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=229.0s)]
*  who may just be logging on. We are having this conversation while we await [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=232.12s)]
*  the results of multiple U.S. states, some U.S. cities telling Donald Trump [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=235.78s)]
*  see you in court. Well, that court hearing is happening right now in [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=240.18s)]
*  Seattle. We should hear what happens relative to that birthright citizenship [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=242.84s)]
*  executive order very soon. Margaret, thank you so much for the conversation. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=246.68s)]
*  We hope to have you back here. Thank you very much. Thanks for having me on the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=249.68s)]
*  show. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROjF6RSUUQ&t=251.4s)]
