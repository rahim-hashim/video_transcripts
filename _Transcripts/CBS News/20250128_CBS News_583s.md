# Kristi Noem joins immigration raids in New York
**CBS News:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I)
*  Hello, I'm Ed O'Keefe in Washington. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight on America Decides, a new edict from the White House, President Trump seeking to [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=2.0s)]
*  freeze trillions of dollars in federal aid. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=5.84s)]
*  And just in, a federal judge in Washington has issued what they call an administrative [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=8.44s)]
*  stay in that funding fight, pausing the funding freeze until at least Monday, February 3rd [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=12.64s)]
*  at 5 p.m., to allow for further litigation. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  The president had aimed to halt funding for foreign aid, funding for nongovernmental organizations, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=21.22s)]
*  diversity, equity and inclusion, or quote, woke gender ideology programs, and funding [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=27.28s)]
*  related to the so-called Green New Deal, which of course was never officially legislation [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  ever signed into law. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  The funding freeze among the first questions asked of the new White House press secretary, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=38.78s)]
*  Caroline Levitt, holding her first press briefing this afternoon. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=42.72s)]
*  It is the responsibility of this president and this administration to be good stewards [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=46.32s)]
*  of taxpayer dollars. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  The American people gave President Trump an overwhelming mandate on November 5th, and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=53.32s)]
*  he's just trying to ensure that the tax money going out the door in this very bankrupt city [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  actually aligns with the will and the priorities of the American people. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=62.4s)]
*  Immigration crackdown. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=68.36s)]
*  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem takes the helm today. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=69.36s)]
*  It comes just hours after she joins an immigration raid in New York City. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=71.6s)]
*  The operation, which agency officials say targeted murderers, kidnappers and other criminals. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=75.53999999999999s)]
*  Let's start tonight with Olivia Rinaldi and Major Garrett. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=82.19999999999999s)]
*  Major, of course, is our chief Washington correspondent, who spent most of today alongside [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  the Homeland Security Secretary in a city, we should point out, New York, that has been [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=89.96s)]
*  cooperating with federal officials. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=94.32s)]
*  Let's take a listen to part of Major's conversation with the Homeland Security Secretary. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=96.28s)]
*  Some might say isn't New York a sanctuary city, but you said the mayor's been cooperative. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=101.56s)]
*  The mayor's been fantastic. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=104.83999999999999s)]
*  In fact, I talked to him on the phone probably four or five times last night how one of these [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=105.83999999999999s)]
*  individuals are so dangerous that we needed the backup of the NYPD to be there in case [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=110.32s)]
*  things went south. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  So Major, what did you learn by seeing these operations and did you really have to wear [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=117.63999999999999s)]
*  a bulletproof vest? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  So tactical gear was provided to everyone and they were pretty insistent. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=122.91999999999999s)]
*  Matter of fact, it was not really negotiable. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=127.52s)]
*  We had to wear it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=129.7s)]
*  So to make one very important distinction, the New York City Police Department cooperated [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=131.12s)]
*  with one of the three immigration actions that we witnessed this morning, all pre-dawn. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=137.18s)]
*  It was one involving someone who had a criminal warrant and had a very lengthy set of charges. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=143.42000000000002s)]
*  New York City Police policy, through the mayor, Eric Adams, is when there is a criminal warrant, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=149.74s)]
*  they can and will assist if requested federal immigration officials, which is exactly what [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=155.94s)]
*  happened. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=163.42000000000002s)]
*  Two other immigration actions we witnessed did not involve New York City Police because [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=164.45999999999998s)]
*  there were no warrants involved and that is a delineation that's important to the City [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=169.66s)]
*  of New York. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=174.44s)]
*  It's important to other cities with so-called sanctuary city status, as New York has. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=175.44s)]
*  So that is the difference. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=181.01999999999998s)]
*  And the mayor did talk to Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security Secretary, four times on [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=183.06s)]
*  Sunday because the Homeland Security Secretary said, look, we would like New York City PD [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=188.89999999999998s)]
*  to be there as backup in case this thing gets out of hand. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=193.34s)]
*  Trust me, based on my observation, Ed, there were about 60 or so personnel involved in [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=197.82s)]
*  this first action against this criminal illegal immigrant. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=203.54s)]
*  There was a massive presence of tactically geared Homeland Security investigation personnel, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=209.3s)]
*  overwhelming show of force. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=216.58s)]
*  They broke into the apartment. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=219.62s)]
*  They arrested four. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=221.3s)]
*  Three children were also taken into custody, not because of their immigration status, but [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=222.54s)]
*  just to find out if they could receive some kind of care while the four adults were being [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=226.78s)]
*  detained and the one criminal immigrant sought was being set on a path to eventual deportation. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=231.26s)]
*  So massive show of force throughout and all of the episodes that we observed personally [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=239.66s)]
*  ended without incident or hassle. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=248.14s)]
*  That does seem like a lot for one guy. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=250.54s)]
*  It was a lot. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=252.78s)]
*  Is this the plan for every single arrest they're going to try to make across the country or [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=254.48s)]
*  are they just doing this because cameras also happen to be rolling? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=260.5s)]
*  Look, clearly there was interest in having cameras present. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=263.53999999999996s)]
*  There's no doubt about that. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=266.94s)]
*  There were other parts of this very large team, I would say 90 or so federal officials, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=268.36s)]
*  which included ICE, HSI, which is Homeland Security Investigations, DEA, ATF, and US [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=272.94s)]
*  Marshals all involved. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=278.98s)]
*  They were also fanning across the city. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=280.58s)]
*  Local media was tipped off to those, which indicates a high interest in having cameras [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=282.8s)]
*  present. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=287.26s)]
*  Some call that performative law enforcement. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=288.26s)]
*  Others call it a way of spreading the message, creating deterrence and a sense that this [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=290.46s)]
*  is going to be different than the Biden administration and the new policies are going to be imposed [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=294.38s)]
*  and enforced aggressively. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=299.74s)]
*  And clearly that's one of the messages they want to send. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=302.02s)]
*  I'm not an law enforcement expert. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=304.74s)]
*  I'm not going to tell you it was overkill. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=306.26s)]
*  I'm just telling you based on my observation, there was a tremendous show of force and [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=307.82s)]
*  it felt and it looked larger than required. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=313.34s)]
*  But again, those are tactical judgments I defer to the experts on. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=317.14s)]
*  And of course, let's remember this is a president who chose cabinet secretaries based on how [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=320.62s)]
*  telegenic they look, whether they can play the part in public and known clearly today. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=323.98s)]
*  Ball cap on tactical gear tweeting about it, talking to you, probably fulfilling the wishes [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=329.62s)]
*  and expectations of the president who wanted to see her do this. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=336.22s)]
*  Hang with us for a second, Major, because this other issue here today, freezing grants [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=339.22s)]
*  and loans is sweeping and has swept the country today with real confusion. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=342.92s)]
*  Olivia, who helps cover the White House with us, do we have any sense before this judge's [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=347.58s)]
*  order that just came in of who this could have potentially affected? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=352.58s)]
*  Well, that was the big question today, right? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=355.78s)]
*  We heard about this memo, but who actually was impacted in the confusion, not only trickled [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=357.68s)]
*  down from the federal government, but to state governments across the country. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=362.02s)]
*  People calling their constituents in Congress expressing mass concern about what they would [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=365.94s)]
*  have access to, what grants, loans, federal assistance. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=371.02s)]
*  Caroline Levitt in the press briefing today said that certain benefits like Social Security, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=374.34s)]
*  Medicaid, other grants and loans would not be impacted. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=380.06s)]
*  But what we saw was that Medicaid websites across the country were down. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=384.22s)]
*  They said this is not related. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=389.06s)]
*  They said, you know, could have been just a coincidence. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=390.94s)]
*  But in any case, it caused a lot of confusion, panic, worry among people. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=393.66s)]
*  We're already starting to see some action from Democratic AGs, but also nonprofit coalitions [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=398.06s)]
*  across the country asking what is going on, when this pause will be lifted, when they [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=403.56s)]
*  could have access to more of this federal funding. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=410.34000000000003s)]
*  I want you to listen to what Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had to say today about [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=413.3s)]
*  the real world effects of this memo. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=418.72s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=421.34000000000003s)]
*  It's a dagger at the heart of the average American family in red states, in blue states, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=423.21999999999997s)]
*  in cities, in suburbs, in rural areas. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=428.21999999999997s)]
*  It is just outrageous. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=433.09999999999997s)]
*  So how's the White House responding to all this confusion? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=436.7s)]
*  Well, a lot of questions in the press briefing today about this. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=439.09999999999997s)]
*  Caroline Levitt said she would provide a list of the organizations that are impacted. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=443.17999999999995s)]
*  What they're trying to stress from the White House is that this memo is not to impact [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=448.1s)]
*  those federal funds and assistance that people need that help them get by in their daily [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=452.70000000000005s)]
*  life on health care to food. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=457.18s)]
*  But what this does is impact those, quote, pet projects that Trump wants to make sure [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=459.06s)]
*  are in line with his priorities and not the priorities of people who are perhaps in the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=463.70000000000005s)]
*  federal government career service officials. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=467.98s)]
*  They're trying to make that distinction, going on cable channels and making this clear, but [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=470.40000000000003s)]
*  still a lot of confusion. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=475.82000000000005s)]
*  Now we have this judge's order that is pausing this until next Monday so people can file [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=476.98s)]
*  litigation against this move from Trump. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=481.86s)]
*  I suspect this is just one of many things we're going to be tracking in the coming weeks [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=484.46000000000004s)]

*  The Constitution is clear on this. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G3LsC_Hj9I&t=545.26s)]
