# What we know about the Treasury data accessed by DOGE
**CBS News:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE)
*  President Trump has placed the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOJ, in charge [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=0.0s)]
*  of cutting the size and spending of the federal government. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=5.8s)]
*  But the department's reach is prompting concerns over the access it has to some of the most [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=9.64s)]
*  confidential information for millions of Americans. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=16.16s)]
*  The actions that Musk and his IT goons have taken, they're illegal, very clearly illegal, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=20.76s)]
*  but so far unprosecuted actions have already compromised millions of Americans' privacy [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=28.48s)]
*  and data security. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=33.88s)]
*  And if you want to understand how nervous you should all be, think about how hard Donald [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  Trump worked to protect his tax returns from becoming public, even under a legitimate subpoena [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=39.92s)]
*  from the House of Representatives. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=44.64s)]
*  So what's DOJ doing with that data? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  He has been looking into this. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=53.36s)]
*  Major, good to see you. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=55.0s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=56.0s)]
*  You spoke with Natasha Sarin. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=57.16s)]
*  She is someone who worked at the Treasury Department under President Biden. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=59.52s)]
*  You asked her about the scope of the information that DOJ now has access to. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=64.34s)]
*  Let's listen to a little bit of that exchange and then talk about it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=69.88s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=72.68s)]
*  I file my taxes electronically. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=73.68s)]
*  I receive whatever refund I get electronically. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=76.48s)]
*  Does that put me inside this database, the bureau? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=80.08s)]
*  It sure does. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=82.64s)]
*  And your bank account information. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=83.64s)]
*  That's how you get your refund electronically. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=85.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=87.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=88.52s)]
*  So not just who I am, where I live. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=89.52s)]
*  How much you made, how much your refund is. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=92.72s)]
*  All of that is in there. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=94.84s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=96.56s)]
*  It is a vast ocean of data. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=97.56s)]
*  And the most private sensitive data about American citizens all sits in the Bureau of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=100.56s)]
*  Fiscal Service and the Treasury Payments Ecosystem. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=106.68s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=109.36s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=112.28s)]
*  And I think for people who are hearing this, the basic questions they probably have are [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=113.36s)]
*  how's this information going to be used and has it ever been accessed like this by an [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=120.72s)]
*  outside entity before? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=126.44s)]
*  Not to our knowledge. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=128.4s)]
*  Under no circumstances has an outside group of essentially IT consultants who speak first [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=129.64s)]
*  to Elon Musk, who then theoretically speaks to President Trump, have access to all this [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=136.32s)]
*  data. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=140.64s)]
*  No, it raises all sorts of terribly scary questions and some not so scary questions. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  But the terribly scary questions are could you get into this data and redirect a payment? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  Send it somewhere else? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=151.48s)]
*  In theory, yes. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=152.76s)]
*  Could you reach into someone's bank account? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=154.6s)]
*  In theory, yes. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=156.76s)]
*  Now those are the most catastrophic, scary scenarios. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=157.76s)]
*  There's no evidence of that right now. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=161.23999999999998s)]
*  The Treasury Secretary, Scott Besant, has said to many people who have inquired, these tech [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=162.72s)]
*  officials who answered Elon Musk have only currently read only access, meaning they can [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=170.08s)]
*  just scan the data. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  The important word there was currently. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=179.16000000000003s)]
*  Maybe a couple of days ago, they could get in there. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  And for what purpose? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=184.60000000000002s)]
*  Right, because there have been reports that they do have more than read only access. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  More than read only access. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  But here's something that, just take it out of those massively terrifying scenarios. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=191.72000000000003s)]
*  Just think about this. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=196.66000000000003s)]
*  Elon Musk personally has about $2.6 billion in federal contracts with his various companies. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=198.08s)]
*  He now, even on a read only mode, knows everything about every other federal contractor, some [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  of whom are competitors. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=211.28s)]
*  He knows every single thing about them, when they get paid, what they get paid. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=213.08s)]
*  And that's information that provides tremendous theoretical competitive advantage to one person [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=218.96s)]
*  in America, an unelected billionaire who happened to write a check roughly for $280 [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=224.36s)]
*  million to President Trump's reelection campaign. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  And this is what he's gotten for it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=232.08s)]
*  That is a kind of singular access to data that in the commercial world is almost priceless. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=233.96s)]
*  And when the White House press secretary was asked about this, she said, oh, well, if there [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=240.4s)]
*  is a conflict of interest for Elon Musk, he'll remove himself. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=244.9s)]
*  He will self-identify his own conflicts of interest and remove himself in those situations, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=249.92s)]
*  which is not how these things usually work. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=256.2s)]
*  It's not how these things typically work. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=258.0s)]
*  And think about it this way. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=259.8s)]
*  Let's say you're on a read only basis. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=261.2s)]
*  You have all this vast data in front of you, Nancy. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=263.4s)]
*  We've all heard the term, even I'm an IT dummy, and I've heard the term scrape. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=265.88s)]
*  Scrape the data. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=270.68s)]
*  Scrape the data. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=271.84s)]
*  Doge is shut down six months or a year from now. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=272.84s)]
*  You're still holding onto the data. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=275.24s)]
*  You still think that is valuable? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=276.32s)]
*  You don't think that has a commercial price that someone would pay a lot of money for? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=278.48s)]
*  Maybe you could parcel it off in bits and pieces and make money each and every one. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  No one knows. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=286.70000000000005s)]
*  All I'm saying is this kind of access and this kind of eyes on right now has zero transparency, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=287.70000000000005s)]
*  zero accountability, and no one in the Republican side really asking any questions. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=295.08000000000004s)]
*  And I think here's the political answer why. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  This is supposed to cut spending. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=303.20000000000005s)]
*  Maybe it will. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=305.36s)]
*  Maybe it won't. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=306.36s)]
*  That means they don't have to vote on it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=307.36s)]
*  That means they are not going to be politically held accountable. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=309.32s)]
*  They don't have to go through the messy legislative process you were just talking to Caitlin and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=311.52000000000004s)]
*  Ed about. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=315.8s)]
*  It's a simple, direct access to get something on the table that's a Trump agenda item that [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=316.84000000000003s)]
*  they don't have to mess with. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=322.2s)]
*  And they've been talking about making big cuts for years, if not decades. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=323.56s)]
*  They haven't been that successful. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=327.66s)]
*  So they may not like the means, but at least it's happening. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=329.16s)]
*  Here's the great irony. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=332.56s)]
*  If you want to cut spending, you don't do it through the Bureau of Fiscal Service. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=333.56s)]
*  You go to the agency and cut it through the agency, which in fact, some Treasury officials [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=336.96s)]
*  said you really need legally to do this. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=341.47999999999996s)]
*  And they're like, no, no, let's just try to cut it straight through this way. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=343.56s)]
*  It's not legal. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=347.32s)]
*  It will probably encounter legal stumbling blocks as they try to do this. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=348.32s)]
*  But it is a vast story with lots of different angles. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  And we still don't have very many answers. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, I know you'll stay on it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=359.59999999999997s)]
*  Major Garrett, thank you so much. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=361.47999999999996s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFgVWl3SPvE&t=363.71999999999997s)]
