# Rep. Suhas Subramanyam on efforts to reign in DOGE
**CBS News:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4)
*  Welcome back. Thanks for staying with us. Today we saw the human toll of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump administration's federal job cuts. This was the scene downtown Washington [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=4.2s)]
*  as emotional USAID employees were given, yes, 15 minutes only to retrieve their [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=9.4s)]
*  belongings and remove themselves from their headquarters after losing their [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  jobs. These kinds of layoffs are taking place across the country and in other [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=19.98s)]
*  parts of the world. I want to bring in Democratic Congressman Suhas [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=25.02s)]
*  Subramaniam who represents Virginia's 10th congressional district. He has [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=28.86s)]
*  introduced legislation calling for among other things more transparency from the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=33.34s)]
*  Department of Government Efficiency and I want everyone to understand the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=38.019999999999996s)]
*  congressman is en route to a town hall in his district on this topic, possibly [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=41.08s)]
*  others, and has pulled over to the side of the road so he can speak to us. So [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=45.26s)]
*  congressman, thanks for pulling over safely to the side of the road. What are [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=48.66s)]
*  you hearing so far from your constituents about this federal [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  workforce reduction? Yeah, you know, my district is about 40 minutes from [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=57.52s)]
*  Washington DC where a lot of the agencies are headquarters and we have [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=63.2s)]
*  headquarters of agencies in our district as well and I've heard a lot of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=67.0s)]
*  confusion, frustration, chaos, and most importantly just a lot of anger over how [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=70.84s)]
*  this is going down. It's one thing to make government better and more [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=77.4s)]
*  efficient, it's another thing to fire the very people who make government more [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=80.92s)]
*  efficient and serve the American people and this won't just hurt the federal [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=84.82s)]
*  workers or the contractors, this will hurt all Americans and will have, you [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=88.66s)]
*  know, irreversible damage to our country. What do you want from DOGE, the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=93.61999999999999s)]
*  Department of Government Efficiency, that you're so far not getting? Anything. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=98.46s)]
*  Answers, accountability, transparency, and really some sort of indication of what [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=103.8s)]
*  they're doing and why they're doing it. Now I think I understand it now that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  we've had about a month or two to see it in action. I think this is more about [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=113.7s)]
*  revenge over political opponents and ideology and control over the federal [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=117.98s)]
*  institutions. I think that's what this seems to be really about because if this [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=124.42s)]
*  is about cutting costs and making sure we're more efficient, you wouldn't be [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=128.18s)]
*  firing people at say the USDA that do make sure our crops are healthy, right? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=132.58s)]
*  Because even if you save a hundred thousand dollars on a salary now, you're [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=137.3s)]
*  going to have millions of dollars in damage later on. And there's just so many [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=140.86s)]
*  stories that I hear all over my district of federal workers who it's one thing, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=143.98000000000002s)]
*  you know, they are definitely concerned about their jobs, what's going to happen [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=149.3s)]
*  with their families, and how they're going to put food on the table, but [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=152.22000000000003s)]
*  they're also concerned about the work they were doing and how important it was [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=155.02s)]
*  and it's going to do damage to everyone, not just federal workers. And there have [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=157.62s)]
*  been, as you know, congressmen, some reassessments of these layoffs. Veterans [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=162.02s)]
*  have been called back after being fired. Certain essential workers that the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=168.86s)]
*  administration discovered they didn't want to fire have been called back to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=173.02s)]
*  work. Does that contribute from your interactions within your district to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=175.86s)]
*  this level of confusion and dismay? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=181.7s)]
*  Yes, but at the same time, I also see those as victories as the administration [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=186.38s)]
*  backtracking. Many of the stories that people shared with my office, we ended [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=191.74s)]
*  up bringing attention to them and putting pressure on the administration. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=196.14s)]
*  And, you know, they fell back. I think if the more people speak up, the more [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=199.98s)]
*  they're going to see some changes because people have a lot of power in this [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=205.45999999999998s)]
*  instance. I've encouraged people. We're having a town hall in about an hour, and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=209.82s)]
*  that's where I'm going to right now. And, you know, we had about 600 seats in [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=213.82s)]
*  the auditorium, 800 signed up, but we had to stop letting people sign up. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=218.57999999999998s)]
*  There's thousands more that I think could end up joining us online. And people [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=223.18s)]
*  are telling their stories and we're seeing change because they are speaking [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=227.06s)]
*  up. They're not letting this happen without a fight. And the more people [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=231.26000000000002s)]
*  fight, the more I think they'll see results. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=234.42000000000002s)]
*  Virginia's Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin has set up a website that [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=236.82000000000002s)]
*  advocates, it says, on behalf of federal workers who have been or will be laid [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=240.82000000000002s)]
*  off, it's sort of a resource available for these workers that the governor and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=245.82000000000002s)]
*  his staff have put forward. What's your reaction to that? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=250.42s)]
*  Yes, you know, we put a similar resource out. I think it's really rich that the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=254.5s)]
*  governor who's told these federal workers who are getting fired, instead of [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=258.41999999999996s)]
*  being their champion, to go find another job in the private sector. You know, I [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=261.82s)]
*  think he, what's the reality is he's running for president in 2028. And so, you [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=266.41999999999996s)]
*  know, he's trying to suck up to the current president and he doesn't have the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=271.18s)]
*  best interest of Virginians in heart because if he ran statewide in Virginia [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=275.14s)]
*  again, he would lose because of his actions right now. He's not doing things [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=278.98s)]
*  that are popular and he's not doing things that are best for Virginians. And [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=282.86s)]
*  so that's my reaction to that. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=286.38s)]
*  In the cloakroom, when you talk to House Republicans, if you have the chance to do [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=288.58000000000004s)]
*  so, what are you hearing about the concerns that you're experiencing in your [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=292.3s)]
*  district? Is there any crossover among Republicans? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=296.38s)]
*  You know, Republicans have been very silent. They've been very nervous. I [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=301.38s)]
*  think on the Democratic side, we've heard from constituents asking us to do [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=307.38s)]
*  more. You know, I think my constituents appreciate what all that I'm doing, but [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=311.18s)]
*  they want to know why Republicans are just letting this happen. And so I've [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=315.26s)]
*  always told people, yes, call my office. Yes, send us emails, but recall the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=319.78s)]
*  Republicans to come out to their town halls as well. Show up and fight in front [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=324.3s)]
*  of them too, because that could also make a change. In the end, they have a [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=329.65999999999997s)]
*  very thin margin in Congress. They have a thin margin in the U.S. Senate. And [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=333.06s)]
*  so, you know, we have to keep putting the pressure on them. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=337.18s)]
*  Congressman Suhas Subramaniam, thank you very much for your time, sir. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JvFoUFWXx4&t=340.14s)]
