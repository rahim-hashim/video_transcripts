# Thousands of USAID workers terminated by Trump administration
**CBS News:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E)
*  Hundreds of workers at the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=0.0s)]
*  are cleaning out their desks. The department was abruptly closed down today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=5.84s)]
*  Employees were assigned 15-minute windows throughout the day in order to collect their belongings. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Spring in CBS News White House reporter Erin Navarro for more on this. Erin, we've been talking [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=16.56s)]
*  about cuts at USAID since I feel like Inauguration almost. Bring us up to speed on what has happened [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=20.56s)]
*  to the organization and its workers and what's next. Lindsay, good to be with you. Some of the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=26.64s)]
*  most drastic cuts actually came recently. CBS News has learned that the State Department says [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=31.12s)]
*  they cut 9,100 foreign assistance grants across USAID and the State Department for a total of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=35.84s)]
*  $58.4 billion. And this means that there are now only 8 percent of USAID grants left. This comes [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=42.56s)]
*  days after all direct hire personnel at USAID were put on administrative leave. On Monday, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=50.8s)]
*  thousands of workers, along with 1,600 others, who were terminated outright. And you brought up [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  some of the images of the staffers coming in during their assigned windows to pick up the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=63.92s)]
*  personal items in what used to be the headquarters of USAID in downtown Washington, D.C. What I'm [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=67.92s)]
*  going to be watching out for now and what they have telegraphed is up next for them is how USAID [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=74.24s)]
*  personnel globally outside the U.S. and their families are brought back to America safely. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=79.28s)]
*  Obviously, some of this has been tied up in the courts as well, Aaron. We know the Supreme Court [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=86.88s)]
*  granted the Trump administration's emergency request to actually pause an order requiring [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  the administration to pay $2 billion in foreign aid by midnight. What is the significance of that? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=95.36s)]
*  And do we know what's next there? Yeah, the Supreme Court decision from Chief Justice Roberts [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=100.16s)]
*  pauses that deadline, gives the Supreme Court more time to do a full review of this case. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=105.28s)]
*  It's significant because the Trump administration had been keeping these foreign aid payments [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=111.12s)]
*  frozen despite that lower court order you mentioned weeks ago to have a February 13 deadline for up to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=115.92s)]
*  $2 billion worth of these foreign assistance to be released. The Trump administration seemed to reject [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=122.4s)]
*  that and it was seem to be leaning on the Supreme Court to give them more time. Roberts has given [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=129.28s)]
*  the plaintiffs contractors and those with grants from USAID until noon on Friday to respond. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=135.28s)]
*  We mentioned those tariffs. President Trump moving forward with tariffs on Canada and Mexico [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=142.72s)]
*  starting next week as well as an additional 10 percent tariff on China. What can we expect there [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=146.96s)]
*  and is there any indication that the presidents of Mexico or Canada could call the president again [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=151.68s)]
*  perhaps make some more promises or concessions to stave off those tariffs? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=157.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's good you brought that up because the fact is these tariffs were actually postponed. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  They were supposed to happen earlier this year but because both countries made changes to their [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  immigration and border policy, Trump and the administration put a 30-day pause. He has said [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  in the Oval Office right now with the Prime Minister that he believes neither of these [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=176.96s)]
*  countries are doing enough to stop the flow of fentanyl into the United States. Thus, he's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=180.96s)]
*  continuing and I guess resuming these tariffs he originally had. He also noted that additional [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=185.92s)]
*  tariff on China bringing that to 20 percent. He continues to blame China for the level of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=192.0s)]
*  fentanyl in the first place. Okay, Aaron Navarro, thank you. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OJ0nbYP9E&t=196.56s)]
