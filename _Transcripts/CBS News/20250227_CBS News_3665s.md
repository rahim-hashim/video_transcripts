# Trump, U.K.'s Keir Starmer meet on Ukraine, trade in high-stakes White House visit
**CBS News:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4)
*  Any moment now, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said to visit the White House for a high-stakes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=0.0s)]
*  sit down with President Donald Trump. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=5.28s)]
*  The two hold what we understand is going to be a closed-door lunch before facing reporters [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=7.04s)]
*  for a news conference a little later today. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=11.4s)]
*  This will be the UK leaders' first time sitting with the President at the White House, but [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=13.88s)]
*  it's really not their first face-to-face meeting. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=17.84s)]
*  Starmer and Trump held a two-hour dinner at Trump Tower in the Big Apple back in September. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=20.36s)]
*  At the time, Starmer's team described the President as a gracious host. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=25.62s)]
*  CBS News Senior Foreign Correspondent Elizabeth Palmer joins us now from London. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=30.020000000000003s)]
*  Elizabeth, we do know this. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=33.980000000000004s)]
*  We are both grown-ups. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=35.38s)]
*  These are not social occasions. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=36.46s)]
*  So it really begs the question, what does Mr. Starmer want? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=38.620000000000005s)]
*  What do you anticipate Mr. Trump wants? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=42.019999999999996s)]
*  Well, Mr. Starmer is going to be very keen not to antagonize the President. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=44.86s)]
*  The last thing he wants is for President Trump to suddenly think it would be a good [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=52.88s)]
*  idea to impose tariffs on British products or otherwise attack the trading relationship, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=56.72s)]
*  which is very important to the UK. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=62.68000000000001s)]
*  But he does have something serious he wants to talk about, and that's Ukraine. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=65.46000000000001s)]
*  In his public statements, he has disagreed with what President Trump has said on three [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=70.6s)]
*  main issues. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  First of all, Starmer says Putin started the war. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  There's only one aggressor here. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=79.12s)]
*  That's Russia. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=81.04s)]
*  Secondly, President Zelensky is not a dictator, but a democratically elected leader with legitimacy [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=82.2s)]
*  from voters. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=88.04s)]
*  And thirdly, Ukraine has to be at the table in any ceasefire or peace negotiations. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  We don't know if he's going to say any of these things today to President Trump, but [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=94.64s)]
*  apparently he is going to push for a U.S. military role in a postwar Ukraine, specifically [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=98.84s)]
*  what he's calling a security backstop. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  He was asked what that means. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=107.7s)]
*  He's refused to define it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=108.88000000000001s)]
*  But he is on record as saying the UK would send peacekeepers to Ukraine, likely other [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=111.78s)]
*  European countries would too. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=116.72s)]
*  So for example, he might push President Trump to commit resources to support such a mission [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=119.1s)]
*  with intelligence, maybe air power, something like that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=124.44s)]
*  As for what President Trump wants, maybe we'll have a better idea at the press conference. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=128.54s)]
*  At the moment, that's a bit of a bit of a mystery. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=133.58s)]
*  Well, and just to orient our viewers to what they're seeing, it looks like you and I may [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=137.82000000000002s)]
*  be live and streaming coast to coast and worldwide when this happens. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=141.62s)]
*  What you're seeing right there on your screen while we have this conversation are all of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  the flags coming out there. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=149.34s)]
*  We are anticipating the prime minister's car will circle there any moment and we will see [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=151.46s)]
*  what we've seen with other world leaders come in, get that handshake, that photo op. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=155.98000000000002s)]
*  So while we have this conversation, just wanted to let our viewers know what we're seeing [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=160.82000000000002s)]
*  right there. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=163.74s)]
*  Another question, how much of a surprise was Starmers announcement this week that Britain [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=165.18s)]
*  would cut its foreign aid budget in order to boost defense spending? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=168.98000000000002s)]
*  Because we know that is one thing that President Trump wants. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=172.54000000000002s)]
*  Look, it was and it wasn't a surprise. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=178.54000000000002s)]
*  After Vice President Vance's speech in Munich made it clear that the US was going to step [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=181.5s)]
*  back from that post-war role of guaranteeing Europe's security, all European governments [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=185.98000000000002s)]
*  and the UK have been scrambling to come up with plans to stand up a more robust military [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=193.01999999999998s)]
*  in Europe and it's going to cost money. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=198.26s)]
*  So Britons were expecting to see that bill anytime soon. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=200.9s)]
*  But the timing of the announcement this week has Starmers critics saying he's pandering [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=205.85999999999999s)]
*  to President Trump and that is likely to antagonize voters on this side of the Atlantic. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=211.1s)]
*  Well, we know you're out getting your coffee, your London fog, or maybe your PG tips and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=218.82s)]
*  seeing the headlines, seeing the papers on stands. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=222.7s)]
*  Overall, as somebody who is there, where that side of the story is playing out, what is [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=226.1s)]
*  the mood of the people there where you are reporting live from about this administration [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=231.1s)]
*  and about the conversations between this administration relative to all things Russia, all things France, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=237.01999999999998s)]
*  all things the UK? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=242.1s)]
*  Britons on the whole are not keen on President Trump and this administration. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=243.1s)]
*  They feel attacked by President Trump and I think they lament what looks to them to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=252.85999999999999s)]
*  be the end of rule of law in America or at least it being eroded. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=259.9s)]
*  So on the one hand there's disapproval but underneath there's a current of fear that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=265.38s)]
*  Britain and Europe will be targeted by the Trump administration. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=271.90000000000003s)]
*  That being said, there is a rising right wing in this country and they will be quite pleased [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=278.90000000000003s)]
*  to have some of the things, for example, their anti-immigrant agenda backed up, if you like, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=289.14s)]
*  by echoes on the other side of the Atlantic. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=296.34000000000003s)]
*  At the moment there in the minority, Keir Starmer is the Prime Minister. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=298.94s)]
*  He's from a left wing party and so you're seeing a country that voted left looking at [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=303.94s)]
*  its old neighbor and friend or friend and ally, the United States, going radically right [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=309.54s)]
*  and there's a lot of disquiet. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=315.34s)]
*  Okay, we're going to go live to a press conference now with Donald Trump. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=317.94s)]
*  He's meeting with the Prime Minister of the UK, Keir Starmer. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=322.94s)]
*  Let's go to that now. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=326.02s)]
*  And it is my pleasure to bring from His Majesty the King a letter. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=328.94s)]
*  He sends his best wishes and his regards, of course, but he also asked me to bear this [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=335.94s)]
*  letter and bring it to you. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=340.94s)]
*  So can I present a letter from the King to you? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=342.94s)]
*  Yes, thank you very much. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=345.94s)]
*  Am I supposed to read it right now? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=346.94s)]
*  Yeah, please do. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=348.94s)]
*  I will do. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=349.94s)]
*  I've got to tell him what your reaction is, so I need to know. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=350.94s)]
*  He is a great gentleman, a great, great gentleman. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=355.94s)]
*  Oh, that's, well, that is really nice. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=374.94s)]
*  I must make sure his signature is on that. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=379.94s)]
*  Otherwise, it's not quite as meaningful. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=383.94s)]
*  It is, and that's quite a signature, isn't it? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=388.94s)]
*  Beautiful. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=390.94s)]
*  He's a beautiful man, a wonderful man, and we appreciate it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=391.94s)]
*  I've known him, gotten to know him very well, actually, first term and now second term. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=395.94s)]
*  Perhaps you'd like to say what that very important paragraph. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=401.94s)]
*  Yes, so this is a letter from His Majesty the King. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=404.94s)]
*  It's an invitation for a second state visit. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=408.94s)]
*  This is really special. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=413.94s)]
*  This has never happened before. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=414.94s)]
*  This is unprecedented, and I think that just symbolizes the strength of the relationship between us. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=416.94s)]
*  So this is a very special letter. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=424.94s)]
*  I think the last state visit was a tremendous success. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=427.94s)]
*  It was. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=429.94s)]
*  His Majesty the King wants to make this even better than that. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=430.94s)]
*  So this is truly historic, an unprecedented second state visit. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=434.94s)]
*  That's a great honor. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=439.94s)]
*  He wants to talk that through with you. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=440.94s)]
*  And that says it Windsor. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=442.94s)]
*  That's really something. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=443.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=444.94s)]
*  What I haven't got yet is your answer. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=445.94s)]
*  The answer is yes. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=448.94s)]
*  On behalf of our wonderful First Lady, Milani and myself, the answer is yes. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=453.94s)]
*  And we look forward to being there and honoring the King and honoring really your country. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=458.94s)]
*  Your country is a fantastic country, and it'll be our honor to be there. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=464.94s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=469.94s)]
*  Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=470.94s)]
*  I shall happily take that back to His Majesty. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=471.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=474.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=475.94s)]
*  I'm going to keep that one. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=476.94s)]
*  You're going to keep that one. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=478.94s)]
*  Mr. President, President Trump, Andrew and Tristan Tate landed in Florida today on a private jet after being released from custody in Romania. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=479.94s)]
*  They are accused rapists, human traffickers, not thought of as good people in many circles. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=487.94s)]
*  Did your administration pressure the Romanian government to release them? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=496.94s)]
*  And if so, why? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=500.94s)]
*  I know nothing about that. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=501.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=503.94s)]
*  You're saying he's on a plane right now? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=504.94s)]
*  He's back. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=506.94s)]
*  They already did. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=507.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=508.94s)]
*  I just know nothing about it. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=509.94s)]
*  We'll check it out. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=510.94s)]
*  We'll let you know. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=511.94s)]
*  Obviously, this involves there's an English element here. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=513.94s)]
*  So obviously, it's important that justice is done and human trafficking is obviously, to my mind, a security risk. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=517.94s)]
*  And so I will catch up with the story in due course. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=524.94s)]
*  Are you aware of it? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=527.94s)]
*  Yes, Mr. President. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=528.94s)]
*  I didn't know anything about it. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=529.94s)]
*  Mr. President, on veterans, they've got 30% of the federal workforce. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=531.94s)]
*  Are you tracking how many veterans have been fired so far? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=536.94s)]
*  Yes, we are. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=540.94s)]
*  We are. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=541.94s)]
*  And we take good care of our veterans, and we're watching that very carefully. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=542.94s)]
*  And we hope it's going to be a smaller number as possible. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=546.94s)]
*  But we are having great success in slimming down our government. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=549.94s)]
*  It's been really very successful. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=553.94s)]
*  And some took payouts and buyouts, and others took other things. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=555.94s)]
*  And some people were finding out don't even exist. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=560.94s)]
*  We're finding that we have a lot of people that don't exist that people thought that did. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=562.94s)]
*  We will be making a statement on that, but we're taking care of our veterans. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=567.94s)]
*  We love our veterans. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=571.94s)]
*  We're going to take good care of them. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=572.94s)]
*  Mr. President, could you be persuaded as part of a peace settlement in the Ukraine to provide air cover, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=573.94s)]
*  a backstop security position to the contributions that Europe might make as well? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=583.94s)]
*  Well, so President Zelensky is coming to see me on Friday, Friday morning. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=587.94s)]
*  And we're going to be signing, really, a very important agreement for both sides, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=593.94s)]
*  because it's really going to get us into that country. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=597.94s)]
*  We'll be working there. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=600.94s)]
*  We'll have a lot of people working there. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=601.94s)]
*  And so, in that sense, it's very good. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=603.94s)]
*  It's a backstop, you could say. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=605.94s)]
*  I don't think anybody is going to play around if we're there with a lot of workers. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=607.94s)]
*  And having to do with rare earths and other things, which we need for our country. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=611.94s)]
*  And we appreciate it very much. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=617.94s)]
*  And I look forward to seeing him. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=618.94s)]
*  We'll be talking about it. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=620.94s)]
*  And we'll also be talking about that today with the Prime Minister. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=621.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, as you know, we've already indicated that we'll play our full part in making sure that any deal, if there is one. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=625.94s)]
*  And I hope there is. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=632.94s)]
*  And I think this is a historic moment to make sure it's a lasting deal. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=633.94s)]
*  And we're about to have a discussion about how we can make that work. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=636.94s)]
*  But I have to say this, as I said yesterday, you're talking about a peacekeeping force. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=640.94s)]
*  We have to make a deal first. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=645.94s)]
*  Right now, we don't have a deal. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=647.94s)]
*  We have Russia. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=649.94s)]
*  We have Ukraine. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=650.94s)]
*  I think we're very well advanced. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=651.94s)]
*  I think Russia has been acting very well. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=653.94s)]
*  We have representatives, Steve Witkoff and Scott and Marco and JD. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=657.94s)]
*  We're all involved, every one of us, and a lot more. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=662.94s)]
*  But I think we're very well advanced on a deal. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=666.94s)]
*  But we have not made a deal yet. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=669.94s)]
*  So I don't like to talk about peacekeeping until we have a deal. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=671.94s)]
*  I like to get things done. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=674.94s)]
*  I don't want to give it the bad luck sign. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=675.94s)]
*  We don't want to do that. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=678.94s)]
*  But we've had very good talks with Russia. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=679.94s)]
*  We've had very good talks, as you know, with Ukraine. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=681.94s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=683.94s)]
*  Mr. President, does the Prime Minister have to choose a closer relationship with the EU [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=684.94s)]
*  as he is seeking and a good trade relationship with you? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=687.94s)]
*  Which one would you go for? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=689.94s)]
*  Well, I think we have just a great relationship. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=691.94s)]
*  We actually had a good relationship before. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=693.94s)]
*  We've met a couple of times, and I'm very impressed with him. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=695.94s)]
*  I'm very impressed with his wife, I must say. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=698.94s)]
*  She's a beautiful, great woman. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=701.94s)]
*  And I said you were very good. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=704.94s)]
*  I said you're very lucky. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=707.94s)]
*  He's very lucky. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=709.94s)]
*  And, no, we've had a very good relationship. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=710.94s)]
*  He's worried about Britain potentially undoing some of the benefits of Brexit [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=713.94s)]
*  by seeking a closer tie with the EU, who you said was set up to screw the United States. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=716.94s)]
*  No, I don't worry about that. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=720.94s)]
*  I thought, you know, frankly, what they did was the right thing at the time. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=721.94s)]
*  And I think that'll probably prove out over the centuries. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=725.94s)]
*  You know, you have a long time to go. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=728.94s)]
*  But I think I predicted that was going to happen, and it did happen. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=730.94s)]
*  And it'll work itself out. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=735.94s)]
*  I think it's already worked itself out. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=737.94s)]
*  Mr. President, some asks from Chegos, Mr. President. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=739.94s)]
*  Keir Stonra has signed a deal to give away the Chegos Islands to Mauritius. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=742.94s)]
*  Will you approve that deal? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=746.94s)]
*  Well, we're going to have some discussions about that very soon. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=747.94s)]
*  And I have a feeling it's going to work out very well. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=750.94s)]
*  They're talking about a very long-term, powerful lease, a very strong lease. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=752.94s)]
*  About 140 years, actually. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=757.94s)]
*  That's a long time. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=759.94s)]
*  And I think we'll be inclined to go along with your country. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=761.94s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's sounding a little bit early. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=766.94s)]
*  We have to be given the details, but it doesn't sound bad. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=770.94s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=773.94s)]
*  Mr. President, you obviously can do business with our Prime Minister, Keir Stonra. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=774.94s)]
*  You said yesterday that the EU was constructed to screw the U.S. when it comes to trade. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=778.94s)]
*  What can our Prime Minister say to you to persuade you not to impose tariffs on the United Kingdom? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=785.94s)]
*  Yeah, did I use the word that you said? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=791.94s)]
*  That bad word? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=793.94s)]
*  I think so. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=794.94s)]
*  I saw it. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=795.94s)]
*  Well, I think that the EU — yeah, I've had problems with the EU because — and we're not talking about — [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=796.94s)]
*  we happen to have a great relationship with you, but we did have — and we do have problems with the EU because they've tariffed us. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=802.94s)]
*  They do it in the form of a VAT tax, which is about 20 percent. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=810.94s)]
*  And many other taxes. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=814.94s)]
*  They sue our companies. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=815.94s)]
*  They sued Apple. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=817.94s)]
*  It got $16 or $17 billion, which was, I think, totally a ridiculous decision. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=819.94s)]
*  And they're suing Google for a lot of money. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=827.94s)]
*  They're suing a lot of other companies. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=830.94s)]
*  And we don't like the way they're treating our people now. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=832.94s)]
*  We don't like the way they're treating our companies. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=836.94s)]
*  They sell us cars. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=838.94s)]
*  We don't sell them cars. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=840.94s)]
*  They don't take our cars. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=841.94s)]
*  They don't take much of our agriculture. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=842.94s)]
*  And we have a deficit with them of about $350 billion. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=844.94s)]
*  So I wouldn't say it's been such a great relationship, personally, but other people did because it's politically correct to say that it's been good. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=849.94s)]
*  But it hasn't been good. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=857.94s)]
*  And we're going to change that. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=858.94s)]
*  And we are going to have reciprocal tariffs. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=860.94s)]
*  We're not going to have tariff. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=862.94s)]
*  We're going to have reciprocal. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=863.94s)]
*  Whatever they charge us, we're going to charge them, which, for many years, foolishly — I would have done that. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=864.94s)]
*  But then all of a sudden we had COVID and we had other things to think about. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=868.94s)]
*  So it took me a little while to get that on. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=873.94s)]
*  But we had — in my first four years, we had the greatest economy in the history of — I think the world, but certainly in the history of our country. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=875.94s)]
*  I think we're going to have that again. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=884.94s)]
*  But the EU was very, very tough on us from the standpoint of trade. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=885.94s)]
*  Then you could take it a step further and go into NATO. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=890.94s)]
*  And that was a very tough situation for us. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=895.94s)]
*  I mean, that's been a very tough situation because we were paying a disproportionate share and it wasn't good. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=897.94s)]
*  So, as you know, they paid hundreds of billions of dollars after I got involved. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=905.94s)]
*  And they evened it out a little bit, but not very much. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=910.94s)]
*  And then if you look at the war, we're in for $300 billion plus, and they're in for $100 billion. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=913.94s)]
*  They get their money back. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=920.94s)]
*  And now we'll get our money back also. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=921.94s)]
*  But under Biden, you wouldn't have done that. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=924.94s)]
*  Biden did a terrible job, I have to say. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=926.94s)]
*  I hate to say that about somebody that sat here just before me, but he did a terrible, terrible job. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=928.94s)]
*  That war should have never happened — the war between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=935.94s)]
*  Frankly, October 7th should have never happened. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=939.94s)]
*  Israel — that should have never happened. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=942.94s)]
*  What happened there should have never — inflation should have never happened. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=944.94s)]
*  Afghanistan should have never happened the way they got out — not getting out, but the way they got out. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=947.94s)]
*  So — but I can say that as far as we're here for a different reason. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=953.94s)]
*  We're talking about a very different place. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=957.94s)]
*  And this is some place that I have investments there. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=959.94s)]
*  I own Turnberry. I own Aberdeen. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=963.94s)]
*  And I own a great place called Doonbeg in Ireland. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=966.94s)]
*  So, you know, I have a great warm spot for your country. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=970.94s)]
*  And our trade, obviously, is fair and balanced. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=975.94s)]
*  And in fact, you've got a bit of a surplus. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=978.94s)]
*  So we're in a different position there. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=980.94s)]
*  Obviously, we contributed hugely in relation to Ukraine. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=982.94s)]
*  And taken together with Europe, there's about 50 percent of what's not in. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=985.94s)]
*  It'll work. It'll work. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=988.94s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=989.94s)]
*  The Press. Thank you. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=992.94s)]
*  So does that mean there won't be any sanctions on the UK there? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=994.94s)]
*  Well, I have to take a look. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=997.94s)]
*  I mean, we're going to have a good discussion today. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=998.94s)]
*  And we have some very talented people on the other side. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1000.94s)]
*  And we have some people that probably aren't as talented to them, but they're pretty good. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1004.94s)]
*  Marco, what do you think? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1008.94s)]
*  Our people are pretty good. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1010.94s)]
*  And now we're going to have a good discussion, and we'll be talking about that. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1012.94s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1015.94s)]
*  Mr. Stahmer, the Prime Minister has said that he believes that Vladimir Putin would be at risk of invading Ukraine again without a sufficient backstop. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1017.94s)]
*  Do you think that Vladimir Putin would be likely to invade again in the event of a peace deal? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1025.94s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1029.94s)]
*  I think when we have a deal, it's going to be the deal. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1030.94s)]
*  I don't think if I didn't win the election, I don't think we'd be even talking to Putin right now or anybody else. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1033.94s)]
*  I think it would just, you know, I don't know if you're looking at the stats, but thousands of people are being killed a week, soldiers mostly, because the towns have been destroyed. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1039.94s)]
*  Thousands of soldiers. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1049.94s)]
*  This was a very bad week, by the way. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1052.94s)]
*  I get the stats. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1054.94s)]
*  And you're talking about human life. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1055.94s)]
*  Number one, I want to see that. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1057.94s)]
*  And it doesn't involve American soldiers, but it's Russian and Ukrainian soldiers. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1059.94s)]
*  And we are going to continue to follow the developments out of the White House now with President Trump meeting there with Keir Stahmer, that bilateral press conference there. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1065.94s)]
*  A couple of the highlights to remember that King Charles extended invitation to President Trump to visit him in the UK. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1073.94s)]
*  And this is, according to Prime Minister Stahmer, unprecedented. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1079.94s)]
*  And President Trump accepted that invitation. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1082.94s)]
*  Also, when asked about Andrew and Tristan Tate, the brothers just arriving in Florida from Romania, facing charges for rape and sex trafficking. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1085.94s)]
*  He said he knew nothing about it. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1092.94s)]
*  When asked about Ukraine, he said there is no talk about peacekeeping until there is a deal. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1094.94s)]
*  He's expected to meet with President Zelensky tomorrow at the White House. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1099.94s)]
*  Stay with us. You're watching us right here. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1104.94s)]
*  CBS News 24 seven. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1106.94s)]
*  We want to take you to the White House now where President Trump is holding a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Keir Stahmer. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1111.94s)]
*  The United Kingdom to the White House. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1116.94s)]
*  Prime Minister Stahmer, you've been terrific in our discussions. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1119.94s)]
*  You're a very tough negotiator, however. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1124.94s)]
*  I'm not sure I like that, but that's OK. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1126.94s)]
*  Very, very special person. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1129.94s)]
*  The Prime Minister and I have gotten off to an outstanding start. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1131.94s)]
*  The U.S. and UK have a special relationship. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1134.94s)]
*  Very special. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1138.94s)]
*  Really like no other passed down through the centuries. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1139.94s)]
*  And we're going to keep it that way. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1142.94s)]
*  We're going to keep it very strong as it is. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1145.94s)]
*  Very importantly, I was just notified by letter from King Charles that he's extended through the Prime Minister a historic second state visit to the United Kingdom. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1147.94s)]
*  And that's a great honor because it's never happened before. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1160.94s)]
*  One person has never been extended that honor. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1164.94s)]
*  And I really do call it an honor. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1168.94s)]
*  But it's not for me. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1170.94s)]
*  It's for our country. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1171.94s)]
*  It's respect for our country. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1172.94s)]
*  So I just want to thank you and I want to thank King Charles. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1174.94s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1178.94s)]
*  And we accept. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1179.94s)]
*  I don't know if the media is going to follow us. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1181.94s)]
*  I have a feeling they might. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1182.94s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1184.94s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1185.94s)]
*  I'm pleased to say that the bust of one of the Prime Minister's greatest predecessors, Winston Churchill, is now back in the rightful place in the Oval Office. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1186.94s)]
*  And we're very proud of it. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1198.94s)]
*  Our meeting today and the various breakout sessions we had were tremendously productive. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1200.94s)]
*  Most importantly, I provided the Prime Minister with an update on our efforts to end the bloody and horrible war in Ukraine with Russia, which would never have happened if I were president. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1206.94s)]
*  That was not going to happen. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1220.94s)]
*  I promise you that. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1221.94s)]
*  After three years of fallacious conflict, approximately one million Ukrainians and Russians have been senselessly killed. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1223.94s)]
*  But the number, I believe, is much higher than that. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1231.94s)]
*  Countless schools, hospitals, towns and beautiful ancient churches have been absolutely obliterated. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1234.94s)]
*  To begin the process of ending this spiral of death, I had historic back to back calls with President Putin. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1240.94s)]
*  Very successful calls, I might add. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1249.94s)]
*  And President Zelensky and my team also spoke with the Secretary General of NATO on numerous occasions. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1251.94s)]
*  And we're working very hard to get that war brought to an end. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1260.94s)]
*  I think we've made a lot of progress. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1263.94s)]
*  I think it's moving along pretty rapidly. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1265.94s)]
*  And I want to thank all of the people that are here that have been working on it. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1268.94s)]
*  And we'll let you know what happens. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1274.94s)]
*  It'll either be fairly soon or it won't be at all. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1278.94s)]
*  In addition, this week I met with President Macron of France, as you know, and held talks with members of the G7. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1281.94s)]
*  Tomorrow the progress toward peace will continue when President Zelensky visits the White House. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1289.94s)]
*  He'll be here tomorrow in the early part of the day and will be signing a historic agreement that will make the United States a major partner in developing Ukraine's minerals and rare earths. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1296.94s)]
*  And oil and gases. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1307.94s)]
*  And we have a great understanding. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1310.94s)]
*  I think it's going to be great for Ukraine. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1313.94s)]
*  We're going to be at the site. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1315.94s)]
*  And we'll be digging. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1317.94s)]
*  We'll be dig, dig, digging. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1320.94s)]
*  Dig, we must. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1322.94s)]
*  A big utility in New York, Conadus, and they used to have a sign, dig, we must. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1323.94s)]
*  And we will be digging. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1327.94s)]
*  But much of the European aid to Ukraine has been sent in the form of loans for which they expect to be paid back. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1329.94s)]
*  And we didn't have that honor under the Biden administration. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1337.94s)]
*  He sent money or just send it money after money after money and never had any any knowledge of ever seeing it back. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1341.94s)]
*  Maybe three hundred to three hundred and fifty billion dollars. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1350.94s)]
*  But under the breakthrough agreement, very unusual, which everyone said was difficult to get. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1354.94s)]
*  But it's really very good for Ukraine and very good for us. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1361.94s)]
*  The American taxpayers will now effectively be reimbursed for the money and hundreds of billions of dollars poured into helping Ukraine defend itself, which by and of itself is a very worthy thing to do. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1364.94s)]
*  We've paid far more than any other country. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1378.94s)]
*  And with most of our support, it's been paid in military, the finest weapons anywhere in the world. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1381.94s)]
*  This includes vast amounts of military hardware, ammunition and various other things that we now have to start rebuilding our own stockpiles. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1388.94s)]
*  Additionally, the minerals agreement will provide the basis for a more sustainable future relationship between the United States and Ukraine and the stimulate the long term prosperity that will help the Ukrainians rebuild their country. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1398.94s)]
*  It's been demolished and the ruined infrastructure, the infrastructure, as you know, is in very bad shape. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1414.94s)]
*  In just over one month, our administration has already achieved more progress toward peace than years in the other administration where they did nothing toward peace. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1423.94s)]
*  They didn't understand what was happening. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1433.94s)]
*  Our approach is basically common sense. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1436.94s)]
*  As I said, so many of the things that we do based on common sense. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1440.94s)]
*  If you want peace, you have to talk both sides. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1444.94s)]
*  As I discussed with Prime Minister Stammer, the next step we're making is toward a very achievable ceasefire. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1449.94s)]
*  We hope that that can happen quickly because thousands of young people in this case, we're not talking about Americans. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1457.94s)]
*  We're talking about Ukrainians and Russians are being killed every week. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1466.94s)]
*  Thousands. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1469.94s)]
*  And it's a rough battlefield. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1471.94s)]
*  It's a flat piece of land and the bullet only stops when it hits somebody. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1473.94s)]
*  And this week I saw the reports and it's, it's, I don't even want to say what they are, but thousands of people, young people, young vibrant people died. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1477.94s)]
*  And we want to stop that senseless, should have never happened. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1488.94s)]
*  This will lay the groundwork for a long term peace agreement that will return stability to Eastern Europe. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1493.94s)]
*  And hopefully ensure that such a terrible war will never happen on European soil or for that matter anywhere again. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1499.94s)]
*  It's a horrible thing that's going on. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1507.94s)]
*  The disaster in Ukraine shows exactly why it's so important for the United Kingdom and other NATO partners to make large investments in their defense capabilities. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1512.94s)]
*  In many cases, four percent or five percent of GDP would be appropriate. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1522.94s)]
*  I know that they're raising it. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1527.94s)]
*  I just read an article, a great article about the work you're doing in the UK as to the military. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1529.94s)]
*  You're raising it quite a bit, which is a great thing to do for your country. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1535.94s)]
*  It's a great thing to do. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1538.94s)]
*  It's sad that we need that, but probably need that. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1540.94s)]
*  So congratulations on that. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1542.94s)]
*  I know you got it through after years of chronic underfunding. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1544.94s)]
*  There's an urgent need to catch up for some countries. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1548.94s)]
*  I want to thank the prime minister once again for traveling here today, working together. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1552.94s)]
*  I believe that we'll once again demonstrate the power of our country's unique friendship. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1558.94s)]
*  This is indeed a unique friendship. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1564.94s)]
*  It's been many years and I think it's only gotten stronger and we will make sure that it stays that way. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1566.94s)]
*  We're going to have a great trade agreement one way or the other. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1574.94s)]
*  We're going to end up with a very good trade agreement for both countries. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1578.94s)]
*  And we're working on that as we speak. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1582.94s)]
*  I think we'll have the confines. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1584.94s)]
*  I think we'll have something maybe even in terms of possibilities agreed to very shortly. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1587.94s)]
*  JD's working on it, vice president, and Scott, and I'm just looking at this all from Mike. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1594.94s)]
*  You're going to work on it. Everyone's going to work on it. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1600.94s)]
*  We'll see if we can do something pretty quickly. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1602.94s)]
*  But we're going to make some great trade agreements with the UK and with the prime minister. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1605.94s)]
*  And it'll happen very quickly. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1609.94s)]
*  So I just want to thank you again and please thank King Charles for the invite. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1611.94s)]
*  And I look forward to you giving our acceptance on behalf of the United States of America. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1616.94s)]
*  Thank you very much, sir. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1621.94s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. President. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1629.94s)]
*  Thank you for your hospitality. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1631.94s)]
*  Thank you for your leadership. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1633.94s)]
*  This has been a very good and very productive visit. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1634.94s)]
*  And with your family roots in Scotland and your close bond with His Majesty the King, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1638.94s)]
*  it's good to know that the United Kingdom has a true friend in the Oval Office. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1644.94s)]
*  And it was so good to see the bust of Winston Churchill back in its rightful place just a moment ago. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1649.94s)]
*  But look, in a moment of real danger around the world, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1655.94s)]
*  the relationship, this relationship matters more than ever. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1658.94s)]
*  We remain each other's first partner in defence, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1662.94s)]
*  ready to come to the other's aid, to counter threats wherever and whenever they may arise. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1666.94s)]
*  No two militaries are more intertwined than ours. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1673.94s)]
*  No two countries have done more together to keep people safe. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1677.94s)]
*  And in a few weeks, we mark VE Day, the 80th anniversary of victory in Europe. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1681.94s)]
*  Britain and America fought side by side to make that happen. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1688.94s)]
*  One of the greatest moments in our history. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1692.94s)]
*  We stand side by side still today. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1695.94s)]
*  And we're focused now on bringing an enduring end to the barbaric war in Ukraine. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1699.94s)]
*  Mr. President, I welcome your deep and personal commitment to bring peace and to stop the killing. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1705.94s)]
*  You've created a moment of tremendous opportunity to reach a historic peace deal, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1712.94s)]
*  a deal that I think would be celebrated in Ukraine and around the world. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1718.94s)]
*  That is the prize. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1723.94s)]
*  But we have to get it right. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1726.94s)]
*  There's a famous slogan in the United Kingdom from after the Second World War. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1728.94s)]
*  That is that we have to win the peace. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1733.94s)]
*  And that's what we must do now. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1736.94s)]
*  Because it can't be peace that rewards the aggressor or that gives encouragement to regimes like Iran. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1739.94s)]
*  We agree history must be on the side of the peacemaker, not the invader. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1747.94s)]
*  So the stakes, they couldn't be higher. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1753.94s)]
*  And we're determined to work together to deliver a good deal. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1755.94s)]
*  We discussed a plan today to reach a peace that is tough and fair, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1760.94s)]
*  that Ukraine will help shape that's backed by strength to stop Putin coming back for more. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1765.94s)]
*  I'm working closely with other European leaders on this. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1771.94s)]
*  And I'm clear that the UK is ready to put boots on the ground and planes in the air to support a deal, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1774.94s)]
*  working together with our allies, because that is the only way that peace will last. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1781.94s)]
*  Mr. President, in this new era, you're also right that Europe must step up. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1788.94s)]
*  And let me tell you now, I see the growing threats we face. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1794.94s)]
*  And so the UK is all in. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1798.94s)]
*  This year, we'll be giving more military aid to Ukraine than ever. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1802.94s)]
*  And just this week, I've set out how we're shouldering more of the security burden. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1805.94s)]
*  We're already one of the biggest spenders in NATO. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1811.94s)]
*  And now we're going much further, delivering Britain's biggest sustained increase in defense spending since the Cold War. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1814.94s)]
*  This isn't just talk, it's action. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1822.94s)]
*  We're balancing the transatlantic alliance, making us all stronger and standing up for our shared values and shared security, as Britain always has. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1825.94s)]
*  Mr. President, it's no secret we're from different political traditions, but there's a lot that we have in common. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1837.94s)]
*  And we believe it's not taking part that counts, what counts is winning. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1846.94s)]
*  If you don't win, you don't deliver. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1852.94s)]
*  And we're determined to deliver for the working people of Britain and America, who want and deserve to see their lives improve. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1855.94s)]
*  So we're both in a hurry to get things done. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1864.94s)]
*  And that's what the UK and US do when we work together. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1867.94s)]
*  We win and we get things done. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1872.94s)]
*  So we'll do what it takes to keep our people safe. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1875.94s)]
*  We'll also work together to deliver some big economic wins that can benefit us both. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1878.94s)]
*  We have a one point five trillion dollar invested in each other's economies, creating over two point five million jobs across both economies. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1884.94s)]
*  Our trading relationship is not just strong, it's fair, balanced and reciprocal. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1893.94s)]
*  We're leaders together in so many areas, ranked one and two in the world as investment destinations, one and two for universities, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1900.94s)]
*  one and two for Nobel prizes, one and two in golf as well, by the way. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1909.94s)]
*  And we're the only two Western countries with trillion dollar tech sectors, leaders in AI. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1916.94s)]
*  And look, we take a similar approach on this issue. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1922.94s)]
*  Instead of over regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities that they offer. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1926.94s)]
*  So we've decided today to go further, to begin work on a new economic deal with advanced technology at its core. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1932.94s)]
*  Look, our two nations together shaped the great technological innovations of the last century. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1941.94s)]
*  We have a chance now to do the same for the 21st century. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1948.94s)]
*  I mean, artificial intelligence could cure cancer. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1953.94s)]
*  That could be a moonshot for our age. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1957.94s)]
*  And that's how we'll keep delivering for our people. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1960.94s)]
*  There are so many opportunities. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1963.94s)]
*  Keep our nations strong and fulfill the promise of greatness that has always defined this relationship. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1965.94s)]
*  Finally, to undermine, to underline the importance of this bond. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1973.94s)]
*  It was my privilege and honor to bring a letter with me today from His Majesty the King, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1979.94s)]
*  not only sending his best wishes, but also inviting the president and the first lady to make a state visit to the United Kingdom. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1987.94s)]
*  An unprecedented second state visit. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1995.94s)]
*  This has never happened before. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=1999.94s)]
*  It's so incredible. It will be historic. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2001.94s)]
*  And I'm delighted that I can go back to His Majesty the King and tell him that President Trump has accepted the invitation. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2004.94s)]
*  So thank you. Our teams will now work together to set a date. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2011.94s)]
*  And we look forward to welcome you in the United Kingdom. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2014.94s)]
*  Thank you once again. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2017.94s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2018.94s)]
*  What a beautiful accent. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2019.94s)]
*  I would have been president 20 years ago if I had that accent. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2022.94s)]
*  Okay. Let's see here. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2031.94s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2034.94s)]
*  Earlier today, you told me that you believe that foreign countries pay tariffs, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2038.94s)]
*  but Americans who are concerned about higher prices believe, as most people do, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2045.94s)]
*  that they're paid by consumers and importers when they import things into this country. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2051.94s)]
*  Can you explain how you came to this belief that foreign governments are paying tariffs? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2056.94s)]
*  And for the prime minister, did you discuss with President Trump his repeated statements of desire to annex Canada? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2063.94s)]
*  And has the King expressed any concern over the president's apparent desire to remove one of his realms from his control? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2072.94s)]
*  So I'll go ahead. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2085.94s)]
*  The first part, the tariffs are necessary because we've been treated very unfairly by many, many countries, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2087.94s)]
*  including our friends, friend and foe. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2093.94s)]
*  But we've been treated very unfairly in trade at levels that nobody's really ever seen before, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2096.94s)]
*  and especially under the Biden administration. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2103.94s)]
*  They really took advantage of the United States. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2105.94s)]
*  I put massive tariffs on China during my four years. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2108.94s)]
*  We had the best economy in the history of our country, probably the best economy, maybe the best economy in the history of the world. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2112.94s)]
*  And I had I used tariffs to even things up. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2119.94s)]
*  And in particular with China, we took in hundreds of billions of dollars and we had no inflation. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2124.94s)]
*  And it's a myth. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2129.94s)]
*  It's a myth that's put out there by foreign countries that really don't like paying tariffs and especially to even up. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2131.94s)]
*  So we've been treated badly by a lot. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2139.94s)]
*  We're using tariffs. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2141.94s)]
*  And I find and you just have to look at the numbers, but I find that it's not about inflation. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2142.94s)]
*  It's about fairness and the inflation for us has not existed. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2148.94s)]
*  And I don't think it's going to exist. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2153.94s)]
*  We're going to bring our car industry back. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2154.94s)]
*  We're going to bring our chips back. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2156.94s)]
*  We're going to bring so many things back to our country, including pharmaceuticals and drugs. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2157.94s)]
*  And the thing that's going to get us there is tariffs. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2163.94s)]
*  And I say often it's my favorite word in the dictionary, but I always preface that by saying now because I got into a lot of trouble with the fake news where they say that's not good. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2166.94s)]
*  So I say God, love, family, wife. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2177.94s)]
*  They're all my favorite words, but tariff is about number four or five on the list. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2181.94s)]
*  But I will tell you, it's going to make our country rich and it's going to stop us from being a laughing stock all over the world. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2185.94s)]
*  Because we have been taken advantage of like no country has ever been taken advantage of. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2193.94s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2198.94s)]
*  And look, we had a really good discussion, a productive discussion, a good discussion as a result of which our teams are not going to be working together on an economic deal. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2199.94s)]
*  Our team is going to be working together on security in Ukraine. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2209.94s)]
*  You mentioned Canada. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2213.94s)]
*  I think you're trying to find a divide between us that doesn't exist. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2214.94s)]
*  We're the closest of nations and we had very good discussions today, but we did. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2218.94s)]
*  That's enough. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2223.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2224.94s)]
*  Please go ahead. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2226.94s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2228.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2229.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2230.94s)]
*  Hi, Natasha Clark from LBC. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2231.94s)]
*  Mr. President, you've said you're working on a new trade deal with Britain, which we of course welcome. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2234.94s)]
*  President Obama once said Britain was at the back of the queue for that trade deal. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2238.94s)]
*  Where are we now? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2241.94s)]
*  When do you think we'll go? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2242.94s)]
*  We're going to see that. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2243.94s)]
*  And Prime Minister, the BBC has today admitted serious flaws over the recent Gaza coverage suggestions of payments made to people linked to Hamas. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2244.94s)]
*  Does the BBC BBC still have your trust? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2252.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2254.94s)]
*  Well, they didn't do well with President Obama. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2255.94s)]
*  He'd never got a lot of things done and he didn't get a trade deal done. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2258.94s)]
*  That was of any importance or magnitude. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2263.94s)]
*  We have we've had great discussions on trade and I think we're going to have a deal done rather quickly, as quickly as it can be done. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2265.94s)]
*  We're going to have something I think rather quickly. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2271.94s)]
*  We expect to do that. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2274.94s)]
*  OK, please. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2276.94s)]
*  On the BBC. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2277.94s)]
*  Look, I've been concerned about the program in question. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2278.94s)]
*  The Secretary of State had a meeting with the BBC. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2282.94s)]
*  I think it was yesterday. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2285.94s)]
*  Could have been the day before. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2286.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2287.94s)]
*  Jeff, go ahead. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2288.94s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2291.94s)]
*  Pardon me. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2293.94s)]
*  Mr. President, do you support Article 5 of the NATO Treaty? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2294.94s)]
*  And are you concerned that it might be triggered if European peacekeeping forces end up in Ukraine? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2298.94s)]
*  I support it. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2303.94s)]
*  I don't think we're going to have any reason for it. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2304.94s)]
*  I think we're going to have a very successful piece and I think it's going to be a long lasting piece. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2306.94s)]
*  And I think it's going to happen hopefully quickly. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2312.94s)]
*  If it doesn't happen quickly, it may not happen at all. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2316.94s)]
*  And we want it for two reasons. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2319.94s)]
*  Number one, I want to see on a humane basis. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2322.94s)]
*  I want to see soldiers stop getting shot because largely it's soldiers. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2326.94s)]
*  Towns have been obliterated, but it's largely that. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2331.94s)]
*  And I don't want to pay billions and billions and billions of dollars, nor does the Prime Minister or anybody else on a senseless war that should have never happened. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2334.94s)]
*  And we're going to get it taken care of. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2343.94s)]
*  But I think it's going to be a piece that's going to be long lasting. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2345.94s)]
*  Do you have a question for the Prime Minister? [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2348.94s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2352.94s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, you were asking the president today about a backstop for Europe if the peacekeeping force ends up in Ukraine. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2353.94s)]
*  Did you feel like you got a satisfying answer for yourself and for Europe? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2360.94s)]
*  And Mr. President, if you want to comment on that as well, please do. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2365.94s)]
*  I thought we had a very productive discussion, obviously, as the president says, the deal has to come first. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2368.94s)]
*  But yes, our teams are going to be talking about how we make sure that deal sticks is lasting and enforced. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2376.94s)]
*  So our teams will be talking about that. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2386.94s)]
*  OK, please, blue. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2388.94s)]
*  Mr. President, some experts think it could take more than a decade to mine the precious minerals from Ukraine. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2393.94s)]
*  How much of the US expect to receive and when do you expect to see that come to fruition? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2399.94s)]
*  Well, we're never going to know that answer. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2405.94s)]
*  But by our being in Ukraine and doing the exploration and also the digging and taking the rare earth, which we need in our country very badly, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2407.94s)]
*  we'll be doing a substantial amount of work, probably about at least what we have in there. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2419.94s)]
*  And we hope to be able to do that. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2426.94s)]
*  You never know when it comes to that. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2429.94s)]
*  You know, you dig and maybe things aren't there like you think they're there. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2431.94s)]
*  We're spending a lot of time there. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2434.94s)]
*  It'll be great for Ukraine. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2435.94s)]
*  It's like a huge economic development project. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2436.94s)]
*  So it'll be good for both countries. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2439.94s)]
*  OK, please. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2441.94s)]
*  Prime Minister, excuse me, Prime Minister, you've talked about putting British soldiers boots on the ground in Ukraine in the event that President Trump succeeds with his peace deal. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2447.94s)]
*  But can you do that without a firm assurance that America will have our back in the form of some kind of security guarantee? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2460.94s)]
*  Were Putin to breach that agreement? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2469.94s)]
*  And, Mr. President, tomorrow you're seeing President Zelensky to sign this deal on minerals and energy that could be hugely important to the United States. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2472.94s)]
*  Will you take the opportunity to apologize to him for calling him a dictator while praising Vladimir Putin, who is a dictator? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2486.94s)]
*  Well, Robert, let me start by saying I've been really clear today and previously that I think that European countries, including the United Kingdom, need to step up in our own defense and security. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2497.94s)]
*  We've been doing that in recent days. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2510.94s)]
*  You saw the announcement we made on spending just the other day. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2511.94s)]
*  In addition to that, I've made it clear that the United Kingdom will play its full part in ensuring that if there's a deal and we hope there is a deal in Ukraine, that that is a lasting deal that sticks. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2515.94s)]
*  And we're obviously working with other European countries on that, France and NATO in particular. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2528.94s)]
*  But I've got I think I'm hosting 18 countries on Sunday to further our discussions. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2534.94s)]
*  You heard from the president this morning that, you know, as historically has always been the case, we have each other's backs. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2540.94s)]
*  And today we've been talking about the deal, how that will be a lasting deal. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2548.94s)]
*  And coming out of this, our teams will now be talking in detail about that. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2556.94s)]
*  And I think we're going to have a very good meeting tomorrow, 11 o'clock. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2561.94s)]
*  And I think we're going to have a very good meeting tomorrow morning. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2565.94s)]
*  We're going to get along really well. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2568.94s)]
*  Okay. We have a lot of respect. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2570.94s)]
*  I have a lot of respect for them. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2571.94s)]
*  We've given them a lot of equipment and a lot of money, but they have fought very bravely, no matter how you figure it. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2574.94s)]
*  They have really fought. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2580.94s)]
*  Somebody has to use that equipment and they have been very brave in that sense. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2581.94s)]
*  Yeah, please. Good. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2586.94s)]
*  And the fire deal is nearing an end this Saturday. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2589.94s)]
*  And there's been some worry that phase two might never get there. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2594.94s)]
*  Do you believe that phase two of the ceasefire in Gaza will come to fruition? [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2597.94s)]
*  And have you spoken to Netanyahu about it? [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2601.94s)]
*  And for the prime minister, this peacekeeping deal has been pushed forward by the UK and France as well. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2603.94s)]
*  Have you been in discussions with any other European countries to join this initiative? [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2609.94s)]
*  And are you expecting Commonwealth countries to also join the efforts? [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2614.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2617.94s)]
*  So we're working very hard in the Middle East and Gaza and all of the problems. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2618.94s)]
*  And it's been going on for years and years and centuries and centuries. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2622.94s)]
*  It's a tough neighborhood, but it could be a very beautiful neighborhood. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2627.94s)]
*  And I think we're going to come up with some pretty good solutions. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2631.94s)]
*  But phase one is almost complete. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2634.94s)]
*  We've had some people that have been very seriously injured, very seriously hurt, both physically and mentally. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2640.94s)]
*  They've come out of there very, very, some of them in very, very bad shape. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2647.94s)]
*  It's shocking. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2652.94s)]
*  Many young people, young people aren't in bad shape. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2654.94s)]
*  Young people are strong, healthy. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2658.94s)]
*  They don't die. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2660.94s)]
*  People have come out dead, young people and old people. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2661.94s)]
*  It's a rough situation, but I think we're going to make it much better. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2665.94s)]
*  And I think that we've had a huge impact on that since we've been in just the four weeks. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2669.94s)]
*  I think we've had a huge impact on Gaza, the Middle East, and we have some pretty good talks going on concerning lots of other people that are going to make it better. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2673.94s)]
*  So we'll see what happens. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2682.94s)]
*  Nobody really knows, but we'll see what happens. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2684.94s)]
*  But I think we've had a very positive impact. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2686.94s)]
*  Prime Minister. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2688.94s)]
*  On the question of the European countries, yes, I've spoken to a number of countries, particularly in the last few weeks. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2689.94s)]
*  We had a meeting in Paris last week. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2698.94s)]
*  I've got a meeting on Sunday with 18 countries to further our discussions. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2701.94s)]
*  Obviously, we've been talking quite intensely to our French colleagues and to NATO, but to other countries as well. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2706.94s)]
*  Because, as I say, I think it's important for European countries, including the United Kingdom, to step up and do more in the defence and security of Europe and our continent in the United Kingdom [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2716.94s)]
*  and we'll do so. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2730.94s)]
*  Well, we're talking to a number of other countries. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2731.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2734.94s)]
*  Yes, in the red, please. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2735.94s)]
*  Pink red, flaming red. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2736.94s)]
*  Is it me or her? [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2739.94s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2740.94s)]
*  OK, thank you, Mr. President. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2741.94s)]
*  A question on Ukraine. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2742.94s)]
*  Number one is, if you're not considering the security guarantees, are you open to other forms of, for example, intelligence cooperation with Ukraine? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2744.94s)]
*  And Mr. Prime Minister, President Trump has proposed a plan for Gaza. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2756.94s)]
*  Does this fit into the two-state solution that the UK held for a long time? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2760.94s)]
*  Do you see it fit into your general Middle Eastern strategy? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2766.94s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2770.94s)]
*  Yeah, thank you very much. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2771.94s)]
*  We're open to many things. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2772.94s)]
*  But before I even think about that, that's almost pleasant to think about because that would mean that peace has been arrived at. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2773.94s)]
*  We have to arrive at that peace. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2781.94s)]
*  And, you know, you went three and a half years with an administration that never even really had a meeting. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2782.94s)]
*  They didn't have a meeting on peace. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2789.94s)]
*  And there was no prospect of peace. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2791.94s)]
*  I think, frankly, Russia wanted to go through the whole long deal. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2794.94s)]
*  I don't think they do anymore. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2799.94s)]
*  I don't think they do. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2800.94s)]
*  We had a very big impact on that whole situation. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2801.94s)]
*  But I don't like talking about phase two until I get phase one. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2805.94s)]
*  Phase one is after make peace. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2810.94s)]
*  And we have to get Russia to agree. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2812.94s)]
*  We have to get Ukraine to agree. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2814.94s)]
*  And I think we will. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2816.94s)]
*  I think we've come a long way. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2818.94s)]
*  I believe we're going to get it done. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2820.94s)]
*  I wouldn't say that if I didn't think so. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2822.94s)]
*  And I think it will be very important, very historic. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2825.94s)]
*  And we're going to save a lot of lives. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2828.94s)]
*  On the question of Gaza, the last few weeks of the ceasefire have been very impactful. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2833.94s)]
*  And for me, there are two images that I remember more than any other. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2841.94s)]
*  The first is Emily Demare, who is British, being reunited with her mother. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2845.94s)]
*  You may remember she had her fingers missing after what she endured. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2851.94s)]
*  That was an incredible moment. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2857.94s)]
*  I had spent a lot of time with her mother while she was held captive. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2858.94s)]
*  And her mother went through absolute torture. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2863.94s)]
*  The other image was thousands of Palestinians marching through rubble, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2866.94s)]
*  trying to return to their communities and their homes. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2870.94s)]
*  So we have to do everything we can to ensure that the ceasefire continues, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2873.94s)]
*  so that more hostages can be returned, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2878.94s)]
*  so that aid can be brought in that's desperately needed. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2881.94s)]
*  And we need to allow Palestinians to return and to rebuild their lives. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2885.94s)]
*  And we must all support them in doing that. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2890.94s)]
*  And yes, I believe that the two-state solution is ultimately the only way [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2892.94s)]
*  for a lasting peace in the region. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2897.94s)]
*  And think of that. She came home with her fingers and part of her hand blown off. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2901.94s)]
*  That's terrible. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2906.94s)]
*  How bad does it get? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2908.94s)]
*  How bad does it get? [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2910.94s)]
*  And we had others that came home in much worse shape than that. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2911.94s)]
*  It's a terrible situation. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2916.94s)]
*  Please, yes. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2918.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2924.94s)]
*  Mr. President, did our Prime Minister persuade you not to put tariffs on the UK? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2925.94s)]
*  And if I may, Prime Minister, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2930.94s)]
*  do you think that Vladimir Putin is a man who will keep his word? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2932.94s)]
*  He tried. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2937.94s)]
*  He was working hard, I'll tell you that. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2941.94s)]
*  He yearned whatever the hell they pay him over there. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2943.94s)]
*  But he tried. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2947.94s)]
*  I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2949.94s)]
*  I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2954.94s)]
*  where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2958.94s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2962.94s)]
*  He yearned whatever they pay him here and today. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2964.94s)]
*  He was working hard at lunch. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2967.94s)]
*  And I'm very receptive to it. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2969.94s)]
*  I think we, in all fairness, in all seriousness, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2971.94s)]
*  I think we have a very good chance at arriving at a very good deal. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2974.94s)]
*  JD and Scott and Howard, all the people are working on it. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2977.94s)]
*  And I think we have a good chance at arriving at a deal that could be terrific, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2982.94s)]
*  really terrific for both countries. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2987.94s)]
*  Okay. Thank you. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2989.94s)]
*  On the second part of the question, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2990.94s)]
*  I think my views on Putin are pretty well rehearsed and pretty well known. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2992.94s)]
*  And my concern is that if there's a deal, and I hope there is a deal, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=2997.94s)]
*  that it must be a lasting deal, that it's not a temporary measure. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3002.94s)]
*  And that is why I think it's really important that Putin knows that this deal, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3006.94s)]
*  a historic deal, which I very much hope comes about, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3013.94s)]
*  is there, is there, and it's a lasting deal. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3016.94s)]
*  And that we're able to deal with any inclination he has to go again or go further. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3019.94s)]
*  I think we'll have two deals. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3025.94s)]
*  I think we'll have a deal on ending the war. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3027.94s)]
*  And I think we're going to end up with a great trade deal with you. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3029.94s)]
*  And it's an honor to be with you. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3032.94s)]
*  And I want to thank everybody very much. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3034.94s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3036.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3037.94s)]
*  President Amitos, where are you? [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3038.94s)]
*  Thank you very much. Thank you. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3041.94s)]
*  Mr. President, I want to thank you. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3043.94s)]
*  We have been watching President Trump speak alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3047.94s)]
*  at a White House news conference today. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3051.94s)]
*  The two talking about the closeness of the relationship. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3054.94s)]
*  In fact, Prime Minister Starmer saying, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3058.94s)]
*  in a moment of real danger, this relationship remains more important now than ever. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3060.94s)]
*  The Prime Minister also said the UK is ready to put boots on the ground [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3065.94s)]
*  and planes in the air to support a deal in regards to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3069.94s)]
*  The Prime Minister telling President Trump in front of the press, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3075.94s)]
*  you're also right that Europe must step up. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3079.94s)]
*  Of course, we know the UK is announcing that they will increase their defense spending [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3082.94s)]
*  percentage of their GDP over the next few years [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3086.94s)]
*  and actually decrease foreign aid in order to do that. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3090.94s)]
*  We also know that the Prime Minister said the US and British teams are working on an economic deal. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3093.94s)]
*  The president just said that he thinks that perhaps tariffs wouldn't be necessary [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3100.94s)]
*  because of the deal. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3106.94s)]
*  Of course, right now, the president is mulling tariffs from the European Union [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3107.94s)]
*  from all imports coming from there. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3111.94s)]
*  And also, they're working on a Ukrainian security deal. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3114.94s)]
*  No details on that yet. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3117.94s)]
*  And then the prime minister, as it relates to the Middle East, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3119.94s)]
*  said a two-state solution is the only way for lasting peace in the region. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3122.94s)]
*  They both took questions from the press. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3127.94s)]
*  Our own Nancy Cordes is inside, so we are just waiting for her to get ready, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3130.94s)]
*  and we'll be able to ask her a few questions. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3133.94s)]
*  She actually spoke to the president earlier in the Oval Office as well. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3135.94s)]
*  The president was asked in response to something that he has said, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3139.94s)]
*  which is that foreign governments pay tariffs, which is not true. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3143.94s)]
*  It is essentially a tax on imports that either the company either absorbs [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3147.94s)]
*  or charges over to the consumer. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3154.94s)]
*  So he was asked why you think the foreign governments are the ones to pay tariffs. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3157.94s)]
*  The president said his response to that was that tariffs are necessary [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3163.94s)]
*  because we've been treated very unfairly in trade. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3166.94s)]
*  He said we're going to bring the car industry back. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3169.94s)]
*  We're going to make our country rich. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3171.94s)]
*  He did not exactly address that particular question. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3172.94s)]
*  Another reporter asked Prime Minister Starmer about this idea of the U.S. annexing Canada. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3175.94s)]
*  Of course, which Canada and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3181.94s)]
*  has been very much forcefully against. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3185.94s)]
*  A reporter asked Prime Minister Starmer about that prospect and his views on that, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3187.94s)]
*  and the prime minister responded that he thought that the reporter was trying to find a divide [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3192.94s)]
*  in a relationship that doesn't exist between him and Trump. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3195.94s)]
*  President Trump was asked in terms of this mineral resource deal, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3201.94s)]
*  some experts saying that it could take a decade to mine those resources from Ukraine [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3207.94s)]
*  and asking how that would work in a time frame. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3212.94s)]
*  President Trump's saying we'll never know, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3214.94s)]
*  but he suggested that apparently Americans would be the ones doing the digging. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3217.94s)]
*  Is my interpretation of that? [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3221.94s)]
*  We'll have to ask Nancy if that was her interpretation as well. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3222.94s)]
*  But said you dig and maybe things are there, maybe things aren't there. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3225.94s)]
*  Of course, this comes ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3228.94s)]
*  visiting the White House tomorrow. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3233.94s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News Chief White House correspondent Nancy Kordes. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3234.94s)]
*  Nancy, I've sort of been talking about some of the news that I heard from today's meeting. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3237.94s)]
*  What did you gather today? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3241.94s)]
*  I think what was most notable both here in this press conference, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3243.94s)]
*  but also earlier in the Oval Office, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3247.94s)]
*  is that the president appears to have had some kind of change of heart just in the past 24 hours [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3249.94s)]
*  when it comes to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3255.94s)]
*  Earlier today, he was asked if he still thinks that Zelensky is a dictator [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3259.94s)]
*  and he expressed surprise. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3264.94s)]
*  Oh, did I say that? [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3265.94s)]
*  I don't think I said that. Next question. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3267.94s)]
*  And then again here in the press conference, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3269.94s)]
*  he was asked if he still believes that Zelensky is a dictator [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3272.94s)]
*  and he took the opportunity to praise Zelensky, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3276.94s)]
*  said he has done an incredible job, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3279.94s)]
*  he praised the Ukrainian people, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3283.94s)]
*  and he said that they deserve to live in peace. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3285.94s)]
*  So it was a very different tone from the president. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3288.94s)]
*  It's not clear exactly why we are hearing this shift in tone from him. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3291.94s)]
*  It could be that he's been working more closely with the Ukrainians over the past week, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3295.94s)]
*  trying to finalize this minerals deal, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3300.94s)]
*  and perhaps that has made him more partial to the Ukrainian president, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3302.94s)]
*  but it is really noticeable the change in tone we're hearing from him [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3310.94s)]
*  when it comes to Zelensky. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3314.94s)]
*  Before we get to more of your exchange with the president in the Oval Office, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3316.94s)]
*  what is your characterization of the relationship between these two? [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3319.94s)]
*  Because I noticed that the prime minister was similar to President Macron [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3322.94s)]
*  in praising Trump and essentially saying, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3326.94s)]
*  you know, you're the only one who can get these sides to the table, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3328.94s)]
*  talking about Ukraine and Russia, [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3331.94s)]
*  also striking a very different tone from, for example, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3333.94s)]
*  Germany saying we're going to have to be prepared to go this alone [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3336.94s)]
*  as the U.S. changes its foreign policy. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3339.94s)]
*  Prime Minister Starmer saying that our relationship is more important than ever [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3342.94s)]
*  and we're more intertwined than ever. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3347.94s)]
*  What's their relationship right now? [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3348.94s)]
*  Right. I think these two had a lot of praise for one another. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3350.94s)]
*  Starmer, like Macron before him, knows that in general with this president, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3354.94s)]
*  you get more bees with honey, and that flattery is always a good way to go. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3359.94s)]
*  He mentioned more than once that President Trump was being issued [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3364.94s)]
*  this special invitation to come back to the U.K. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3369.94s)]
*  and he noted how unusual and unprecedented that is, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3373.94s)]
*  making clear that he views President Trump as a very important partner and ally. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3377.94s)]
*  And there was a moment of levity here in the press conference [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3383.94s)]
*  when the president and the prime minister were asked [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3388.94s)]
*  whether Starmer had been able to convince President Trump [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3392.94s)]
*  not to impose tariffs on the U.K., [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3396.94s)]
*  even as the president has been saying he's going to be imposing tariffs [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3399.94s)]
*  on most countries around the world, friend or foe. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3402.94s)]
*  And the president said, well, he tried really hard over lunch [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3405.94s)]
*  and he certainly earned whatever he's making today [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3409.94s)]
*  because he really made a strong case, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3412.94s)]
*  and President Trump actually said he's open to that case. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3413.94s)]
*  So it did seem that the two had a productive and friendly conversation [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3417.94s)]
*  here at the White House today. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3423.94s)]
*  Now you mentioned a lighter moment, a lot of laughter after that. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3424.94s)]
*  He tried remark. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3426.94s)]
*  Nancy, I've teased this twice now. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3427.94s)]
*  You were inside the Oval Office when President Trump sat down with the prime minister. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3429.94s)]
*  You asked President Trump about his efforts to protect veterans [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3432.94s)]
*  amid all these doge cuts, Department of Government Efficiency. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3436.94s)]
*  Let's play that exchange. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3439.94s)]
*  Mr. President, veterans make up 30 percent of the federal workforce. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3441.94s)]
*  Are you tracking how many veterans have been fired so far? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3446.94s)]
*  Yes, we are. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3450.94s)]
*  Do you want doge to avoid letting them go? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3451.94s)]
*  And we take good care of our veterans, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3453.94s)]
*  so we're watching that very carefully, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3454.94s)]
*  and we hope it's going to be as small a number as possible. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3456.94s)]
*  But we are having great success in slimming down our government. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3459.94s)]
*  It's been really very successful. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3463.94s)]
*  And some took payouts and buyouts, and others took other things. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3465.94s)]
*  And some people we're finding out don't even exist. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3470.94s)]
*  We're finding that we have a lot of people that don't exist [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3473.94s)]
*  that people thought that did. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3475.94s)]
*  We will be making a statement on that, but we're taking care of our veterans. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3477.94s)]
*  We love our veterans. We're going to take good care of them. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3481.94s)]
*  So, Nancy, it seems to be two conflicting ideas. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3483.94s)]
*  Hopefully it's as small as possible, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3486.94s)]
*  but we're very successful in slimming down the government workforce. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3488.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3490.94s)]
*  Right, and the reason I ask that question is because Democrats are now estimating [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3491.94s)]
*  that 6,000 veterans so far have lost their jobs as a result of these doge cuts, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3495.94s)]
*  because veterans make up such a large percentage of the federal workforce. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3501.94s)]
*  And part of the challenge has been that, as you know, [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3506.94s)]
*  they've been going after probationary workers first, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3510.94s)]
*  workers who don't have full civil service protections [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3513.94s)]
*  because in many cases they've only been on the job for a year or two. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3516.94s)]
*  Well, that is an area in particular where veterans are concentrated [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3520.94s)]
*  because while they have served their country in uniform for many years, [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3524.94s)]
*  they may be new to the federal workforce in a civilian capacity. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3529.94s)]
*  And so they have been caught up in these cuts. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3533.94s)]
*  And when I asked the president about that, he said, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3537.94s)]
*  well, we're going to try to make sure it's as few veterans as possible. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3540.94s)]
*  But we haven't gotten any indication that that is a special and specific effort [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3543.94s)]
*  that is underway by doge, by these agencies to prevent veterans from losing their jobs. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3548.94s)]
*  Nancy, before we brought you in, I was talking about an exchange [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3553.94s)]
*  between a reporter and President Trump about the Ukrainian mineral deal. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3556.94s)]
*  We know that Ukrainian President Zelensky is expected at the White House tomorrow. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3560.94s)]
*  A framework on that deal has been agreed upon. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3563.94s)]
*  It could be signed tomorrow. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3565.94s)]
*  And the reporter was saying some experts say it could take a decade [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3567.94s)]
*  to mine these resources from Ukraine. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3570.94s)]
*  The president seemed to suggest that it would be Americans [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3572.94s)]
*  who would be digging this up in Ukraine [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3575.94s)]
*  and that we never really know what you're going to get. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3577.94s)]
*  Is that your understanding also of the president's response? [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3579.94s)]
*  And did we know that prior to today? [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3581.94s)]
*  So, you know, a lot of the details about this deal are shifting [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3584.94s)]
*  and coming out piecemeal. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3589.94s)]
*  It's not surprising that the president, who often approaches these kinds of negotiations [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3591.94s)]
*  with the mindset of a real estate builder and investor, [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3597.94s)]
*  might want Americans to actually be involved on the ground [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3600.94s)]
*  seeking out some of these rare earth minerals. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3605.94s)]
*  So that would not be surprising if that is, in fact, a part of the deal. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3610.94s)]
*  Interesting that there was a suggestion that this might not benefit Ukrainians [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3614.94s)]
*  or Americans right away because it takes such a long time [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3620.94s)]
*  to locate and get to the minerals. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3623.94s)]
*  Another interesting thing that the president said was that this could kind of be, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3625.94s)]
*  you know, like an economic benefit for Ukraine itself, having Americans there, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3628.94s)]
*  that, you know, that there would be, you know, more people spending money in Ukraine [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3635.94s)]
*  and that would help Ukraine. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3639.94s)]
*  Well, that's kind of the idea behind a lot of USAID projects as well around the world, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3640.94s)]
*  that Americans come in, they spend money there, they spend money on projects, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3645.94s)]
*  and it helps the local or governmental, local economy or the country's economy. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3649.94s)]
*  And we know that USAID has been all but wiped out by this administration. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3656.94s)]
*  Nancy Cordes, thank you. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3661.94s)]
*  You're welcome. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Mhj4H3fC4&t=3663.94s)]
