# McConnell becomes lone Republican to vote against RFK Jr.'s confirmation
**CBS News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0)
*  President Trump's cabinet expanded today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=0.0s)]
*  The Senate confirmed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Health and Human Services Secretary in [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=2.44s)]
*  a 52-to-48 vote. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=6.12s)]
*  Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee also advanced the nomination of Cash Patel [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=7.8s)]
*  as FBI Director. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=11.36s)]
*  It now heads to the Senate floor for a full chamber vote in the coming days. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=12.36s)]
*  Nicole Killian on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=15.68s)]
*  Nicole, great to see you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=17.8s)]
*  Let's start with RFK Jr. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=19.48s)]
*  Senator McConnell of Kentucky, the former leader, the only Republican to vote against [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=21.32s)]
*  this confirmation. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=25.0s)]
*  What does that reveal about the cohesion in the GOP around RFK, who is seen as widely [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=26.96s)]
*  controversial? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  Well, certainly, Leader McConnell, the former leader, has made clear that he does not always [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=32.88s)]
*  follow the grain, and he has opposed several of the president's nominees, whether that [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  is RFK Jr., just the other day, Tulsi Gabbard, and of course, Pete Hegseth, for Defense Secretary. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=46.5s)]
*  In terms of his opposition today for RFK Jr., basically, he kind of warned as much at the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=54.12s)]
*  time of RFK Jr.'s nomination, explaining that he was a polio survivor, and he really kind [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=59.64s)]
*  of took issue with trying to put these disproven theories out into the atmosphere. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=65.92s)]
*  So in a statement today, he said that, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=70.92s)]
*  I will not condone the re-litigation of proven cures, and neither will millions of Americans. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=72.52s)]
*  So that's in part why he did not support Kennedy's nomination, but obviously it wasn't enough [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=77.92s)]
*  to stop Kennedy from being confirmed today. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=83.64s)]
*  Education Secretary nominee Linda McMahon, Nicole, appeared on Capitol Hill today for [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=86.92s)]
*  her confirmation hearing. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=92.64s)]
*  Let's listen to an exchange she had regarding the potential shuttering of the Department [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=94.2s)]
*  of Education. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=98.28s)]
*  Yes or no, do you agree that since the Department was created by Congress, it would need an [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=99.28s)]
*  act of Congress to actually close the Department of Education? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=105.68s)]
*  And certainly President Trump understands that we'll be working with Congress. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  We'd like to do this right. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=113.12s)]
*  We'd like to make sure that we are presenting a plan that I think our senators could get [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=115.0s)]
*  on board with and our Congress could get on board with that would have a better functioning [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  Department of Education, but certainly does require congressional action. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=125.44000000000001s)]
*  Nicole, President Trump has said he wants the Department to be closed, quote, immediately. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=131.28s)]
*  So how significant is it that his pick to leave the Department believes he would need [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=136.2s)]
*  congressional approval to do so? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=140.01999999999998s)]
*  Well, look, even though Linda McMahon was very measured in her testimony today, for [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  instance, she made clear that education would not be defunded, that really this was about [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=147.0s)]
*  trying to make the Department of Education more efficient. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=153.12s)]
*  At the same time, she did suggest that it was possible that some functions of the Department [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=156.44s)]
*  of Education could be outboarded to other federal agencies, for instance, like HHS in [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=162.28s)]
*  terms of dealing with children who may have special needs or disabilities. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=167.84s)]
*  That being said, I caught up earlier today with former Education Secretary Arne Duncan [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=172.44s)]
*  and asked him whether or not after McMahon's testimony today, if he feels that the Department [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=177.68s)]
*  of Education is more or less at risk. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=183.6s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=186.48s)]
*  The Department of Education is at extraordinary risk, but even more importantly, public education [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=188.04s)]
*  is America is under assault. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=193.28s)]
*  And I desperately hope Linda McMahon comes with a pure heart and comes to help create [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=195.95999999999998s)]
*  opportunity and to help kids. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=202.56s)]
*  We have a crisis education in our country now, a reading crisis. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=205.2s)]
*  There's not a single thing that President Trump has said that would help a single child [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=209.28s)]
*  learn to read or learn to read faster. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=214.24s)]
*  And so this is all about dismantling public education. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=217.0s)]
*  And he also expressed a lot of concern if the department were dismantled in any way [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=222.64s)]
*  or if some of those services and funding were outboarded. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=227.96s)]
*  What impact that could have downstream? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=231.56s)]
*  Obviously, he's also a former superintendent of Chicago Public Schools. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=234.04s)]
*  And so he talked about some of those real world impacts, whether that is on Pell grants in [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=237.68s)]
*  terms of higher education, whether that is, again, helping students with special needs, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=242.44s)]
*  low income students. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  So he said he's very concerned about the state of education. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=248.32000000000002s)]
*  I also asked him if he felt Linda McMahon was qualified for this position. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=251.88s)]
*  And while he didn't say one way or the other, he did say that he thought that the president [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=255.52s)]
*  could have picked other people who were less qualified and not up to the task. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=260.44s)]
*  So, again, as you heard him there say, he doesn't necessarily know her heart, but he [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=265.84s)]
*  certainly believes in preserving the department if at all possible. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=271.08s)]
*  Nicole, as you know, Democratic Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota announced she will not [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=276.68s)]
*  run for reelection next year. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=281.88s)]
*  What's the mood on Capitol Hill about this? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=284.4s)]
*  Is this make the Minnesota Senate race competitive in twenty twenty six and who might [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=286.28s)]
*  jump in? Yeah, I think we're already off to the races with that one. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=291.2s)]
*  Bob, because, you know, we saw a number of senators come out with statements today [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=295.56s)]
*  from her fellow senator, Amy Klobuchar, praising the work of Tina Smith to leader [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=301.56s)]
*  Chuck Schumer, who also praised Tina Smith as a remarkable senator, but said he believes [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=307.76s)]
*  that they will keep the seat of blue shortly thereafter. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=313.0s)]
*  However, we saw the NRC put out a statement, of course, Tim Scott now leading the NRC [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=316.56s)]
*  saying that we believe Minnesota is in play. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=322.48s)]
*  So, again, we're already off to the races, even hours into this announcement. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=325.16s)]
*  But certainly there is a possibility of, you know, a short list already that's starting [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=331.68s)]
*  to circulate, whether that is someone like the former vice presidential candidate, Tim [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  Walls, who said he may be exploring another run for governor, but also may be open to [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=344.52s)]
*  considering the Senate seat. So we'll have to see kind of what other names may emerge [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=349.2s)]
*  in the future. Governor Walls may be in the Senate. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=352.88s)]
*  We'll have to see. Nicole Killian, thank you. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiKvDdScW0&t=355.91999999999996s)]
