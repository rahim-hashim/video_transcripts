# Trump expected to sign about 200 executive orders after being sworn in
**CBS News:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg)
*  President-elect Donald Trump is expected to sign more than 200 executive actions today, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=0.0s)]
*  a huge wave of policy proposals on everything from immigration to DEI to establishing an [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=7.08s)]
*  agency for government efficiency. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  We're going to go through all of that. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=17.0s)]
*  Let's first bring in senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe on Capitol [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=18.32s)]
*  Hill. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=23.0s)]
*  And so, Ed, what can we expect today? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=24.0s)]
*  Nora, good to be with you. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=25.8s)]
*  Happy Inauguration Day from Capitol Hill. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  In this hour, Trump aides in waiting have been briefing reporters on some of the details [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=29.56s)]
*  of those executive orders you mentioned that he's going to sign. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=34.24s)]
*  There are at least 10 regarding the issue that has defined his political career more [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=37.32s)]
*  than any other, immigration and border security. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=41.74s)]
*  Ten of them, one aide says, to rectify, as they put it, the situation at the U.S.-Mexico [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=44.68s)]
*  border. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=50.32s)]
*  First of all, the president will declare a national emergency along the U.S.-Mexico border. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=51.32s)]
*  That gives him immediate powers as commander-in-chief to begin deploying the military and other [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=55.96s)]
*  security assets to that region and to begin refocusing several federal agencies on the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  issue. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=65.28s)]
*  He's going to clarify the military's role, they tell us, in protecting the, quote, territorial [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=66.28s)]
*  integrity of the United States. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=70.28s)]
*  They're going to end a handful of different immigration-related policies from the Biden [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  era, catch and release. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=77.04s)]
*  They're going to reinstate the remain-in-Mexico plan that has migrants wait over there as [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=78.04s)]
*  they seek asylum. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=82.44s)]
*  And they're going to restore construction of the border wall, particularly in parts [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=84.16000000000001s)]
*  of Arizona and Texas that we've seen that were literally, construction was suspended [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=87.84s)]
*  almost four years ago this week, and now it will resume. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=92.16000000000001s)]
*  He's going to suspend refugee resettlement for at least four months. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=95.44000000000001s)]
*  So that affects a handful of different countries around the world with various issues where [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=98.36000000000001s)]
*  refugees have been trying to get into the United States. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  He's going to end asylum and close the border to illegals via proclamation, they say, create [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=106.48s)]
*  an immediate removal process without the possibility of asylum for many of those. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=110.88s)]
*  Quote, we are going to then end birthright citizenship. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=114.83999999999999s)]
*  Remember, that's in the Constitution. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  It's also opposed, ending it, by about seven in 10 Americans, according to the CBS News [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=120.56s)]
*  poll that came out yesterday. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  They're going to try to enhance the vetting and screening of what they call illegal aliens, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  and they're going to rescind, quote, open border policies of the Biden administration [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=130.76s)]
*  and try to bolster customs and border protection, immigration and customs enforcement, restore [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=134.35999999999999s)]
*  the death penalty for any undocumented immigrant who kills a law enforcement officer and encourage [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=139.08s)]
*  states to do so as well. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=145.4s)]
*  Most urgently, we're waiting to see where immigration and customs enforcement might [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  begin carrying out removal programs in cities to try to target undocumented immigrants who [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=151.68s)]
*  may have criminal records or be considered threats to national security and get them [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=157.28s)]
*  back to their home countries. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=161.08s)]
*  There have been a handful of discussions with Latin American countries about establishing [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=162.36s)]
*  quick partnerships that allow those immigrants to be sent back, and we expect many major [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=166.74s)]
*  American cities. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=170.86s)]
*  We heard over the weekend Chicago would be one, but there will be others. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=171.86s)]
*  And when it comes to classifying drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, another [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=175.46s)]
*  thing he's expected to do, watch for Mexico's reaction. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=179.52s)]
*  They're not going to be happy about this because it'll perceive them as harboring terrorists, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=182.94s)]
*  and a big part of their society, of course, is controlled by drug cartels. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=187.98000000000002s)]
*  So it creates immediate problems here in the Western Hemisphere as he starts to dramatically [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=191.56s)]
*  reshape immigration policy. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=195.58s)]
*  Nora. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrTARGckhg&t=196.82s)]
