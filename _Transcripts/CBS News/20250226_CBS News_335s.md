# Vatican update on Pope Francis' health slightly improving
**CBS News:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48)
*  Alright, update now on Pope Francis, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=0.0s)]
*  who has been hospitalized for [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=2.12s)]
*  13 days now for pneumonia. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=3.84s)]
*  The Vatican Press Office just put [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=5.72s)]
*  out a bulletin minutes ago saying [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=7.88s)]
*  his condition has improved slightly [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=10.16s)]
*  from critical. It says his slight [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=12.16s)]
*  kidney failure has resolved and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=14.48s)]
*  blood tests are showing improvement. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  He is continuing oxygen therapy and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=18.32s)]
*  his prognosis has improved slightly. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=20.48s)]
*  We're told he devoted his [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=22.56s)]
*  afternoon to work activities. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=24.32s)]
*  Now we have been seeing over the past [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=25.76s)]
*  few days people gather to pray for [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=28.4s)]
*  the Pope around the world. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=30.479999999999997s)]
*  A special service was held today [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=32.199999999999996s)]
*  inside the Chapel of the hospital [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=34.0s)]
*  today where the Pope has been staying [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=36.0s)]
*  and people been gathering in [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=38.2s)]
*  Vatican City nightly. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=40.0s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=41.0s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=43.0s)]
*  Chris Livesey, who is live now from Rome. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=44.2s)]
*  Chris, what can you tell us about [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=47.28s)]
*  the Pope's condition now? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=48.64s)]
*  Well, as you said, there's some slight [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=53.92s)]
*  improvement now not to overstate it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=56.68s)]
*  He is still sick with not just [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=59.040000000000006s)]
*  pneumonia but double pneumonia. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=61.28s)]
*  And we had that scare over the weekend [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=63.24s)]
*  when they told us that he had to get high [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  flow oxygen. He's still getting that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=67.12s)]
*  high flow oxygen, but they're able to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=69.84s)]
*  moderate the amount of oxygen that he gets. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=71.56s)]
*  There's no more mention of blood [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=74.04s)]
*  transfusions, no more mention of pain. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=75.64s)]
*  Those were some of the other alarming [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=77.84s)]
*  details that came out over the weekend [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=79.84s)]
*  that got all of us so ready to report [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=81.76s)]
*  on what might happen next with [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=85.12s)]
*  Pope Francis's health. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=86.64s)]
*  But right now we're getting a different [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=87.76s)]
*  picture, one that comes with slight [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  improvement. As you also mentioned, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  he's resuming some of his work activities. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=94.04s)]
*  So it's kind of like business as usual. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=97.0s)]
*  This is the Pope's fourth time that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=99.72s)]
*  he's stayed at the hospital since he [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=102.2s)]
*  became Pope, fourth time also just since [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  2021. So just in the last four years, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=107.28s)]
*  he's been kind of a regular at the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=109.48s)]
*  hospital. And in each of those visits, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  he's been able to carry out his work [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=113.64s)]
*  duties. And this is just showing that, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=115.52s)]
*  you know, the Catholic Church is still [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=117.76s)]
*  being run by Pope Francis despite being [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=120.16s)]
*  sent to the hospital for double pneumonia. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  He's also able to get up out of bed. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=125.76s)]
*  He's able to eat food regularly, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=127.44s)]
*  so not through a feeding tube, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=129.32s)]
*  not intravenously. So things are looking [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  slightly better, key words slightly from [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=133.4s)]
*  this latest report from the Vatican. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=136.32s)]
*  That is good news. And Chris, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=138.2s)]
*  Nora O'Donnell actually sat down with [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=139.8s)]
*  Pope Francis in May of 2024, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=141.28s)]
*  and that interview is circulating again [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=143.92s)]
*  online right now. That's because Nora [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=145.92s)]
*  asked if the Pope, if he would ever [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=148.12s)]
*  consider resigning. Take a listen to that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=150.64s)]
*  So you have no plans to resign? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=153.16s)]
*  Or retire? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=156.84s)]
*  I know you don't like this question. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=159.16s)]
*  Not at all. Ask all you want. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=163.88s)]
*  It has never occurred to me. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=166.52s)]
*  Maybe if the day comes when my health [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=168.36s)]
*  can go no further, perhaps because [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=170.16s)]
*  the only infirmity I have is my knee, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=172.6s)]
*  and that is getting much better, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=175.12s)]
*  but it never occurred to me. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=177.0s)]
*  Now it's worth remembering that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  Pope Francis took office in 2013 [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=181.8s)]
*  when Pope Benedict became the first [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=183.88s)]
*  pope to actually resign from office [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=185.76s)]
*  in 600 years. He chose to step down [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=187.64s)]
*  the age of 85 and died almost a decade later. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=190.64s)]
*  Now Benedict's resignation actually [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=193.8s)]
*  sparked up debate about creating new rules [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=195.28s)]
*  for future popes that might follow [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=197.72s)]
*  in his footsteps and resign if [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=199.76s)]
*  they can't continue their duties. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=202.2s)]
*  So going back to Pope Francis, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=203.56s)]
*  what are the next steps for the Vatican [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=205.28s)]
*  if Pope Francis is unable to perform his duties? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=207.04s)]
*  Is there any protocol in place? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=210.16s)]
*  Are discussions being made behind closed doors? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=211.84s)]
*  Well, effectively, if Pope Francis [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=217.84s)]
*  is incapable of carrying out his papal duties, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=220.23999999999998s)]
*  then you have administrators here at the Vatican [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=223.64s)]
*  who can carry them out. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  It's presumed that they're already carrying [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=229.68s)]
*  some of them out for him while he's in the hospital. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=231.8s)]
*  You have the Secretary of State, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  and you have the Chamberlain, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=237.68s)]
*  the first two that come to mind [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=239.28s)]
*  that would carry out those duties. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  It's something to seriously consider. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=244.0s)]
*  Pope Francis himself has talked about [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=246.44s)]
*  possibly resigning, not just in that interview [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=248.68s)]
*  with Nora O'Donnell, but I've heard him [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=251.0s)]
*  talk about it on the papal plane, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=252.96s)]
*  but he's never said that it's something [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=254.68s)]
*  he really seriously considers. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=256.56s)]
*  But of course, he also talked about [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=259.15999999999997s)]
*  having drafted a resignation letter [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=261.12s)]
*  shortly after he became Pope [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=263.08s)]
*  in the event that he becomes incapacitated. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=265.0s)]
*  But he's made a distinction between himself [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=267.76s)]
*  and Pope Benedict who resigned. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  He certainly respected Pope Benedict, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=271.96s)]
*  that decision that led to Pope Francis' own papacy, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=274.08s)]
*  but every chance he's had to indicate [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=277.08s)]
*  the decision he would make given a similar circumstance, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=279.28s)]
*  he's made it clear that he wouldn't be as quick [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=282.64s)]
*  to resign. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  That said, this is a very special year right now. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=286.68s)]
*  It's a holy year. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=289.16s)]
*  It's the year of Jubilee. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=290.08s)]
*  There are a lot of events on his calendar. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=291.32s)]
*  You have tens of millions of people [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=293.88s)]
*  coming from all corners of the globe, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=295.96000000000004s)]
*  and not just to see Rome during the holy year, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=298.76s)]
*  but to see Pope Francis himself [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=300.88s)]
*  supposed to make dozens of public appearances. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  And if he can't make those appearances, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=305.96000000000004s)]
*  many Vatican experts have been saying quite vocally [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wF5mhHt48&t=308.44s)]
