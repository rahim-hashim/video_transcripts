*  During his opening comments ranking Democratic member Jack Reid addressed the reports and accusations against Trump's pick [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=38.88s)]
*  Indeed the totality of your own writings and alleged conduct would disqualify any [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=45.84s)]
*  Servicemember from holding any leadership position in the military much less being confirmed as the Secretary of Defense [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=51.24s)]
*  Hegseth has also faced criticism for failing to meet with Democratic senators prior to today's hearing that came up a lot today [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=58.4s)]
*  Trump's Defense Secretary pick says he will bring back the quote warrior ethos to the Defense Department [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=64.28s)]

*  The demonstrators were quickly removed from the room shortly after Trump's pick for the top defense official [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=82.0s)]
*  Addressed critics concerns about his qualifications for the position [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=86.84s)]
*  It is true and has been acknowledged that I don't have a similar biography to defense secretaries of the last 30 years [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=91.16000000000001s)]
*  But as President Trump also told me we've repeatedly placed people atop the Pentagon with supposedly the right credentials [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=97.56s)]
*  whether they are retired generals academics or defense contractor executives and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=105.04s)]
*  Where has it gotten us? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=110.4s)]
*  He believes and I humbly agree [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=113.08000000000001s)]
*  That it's time to give someone with dust on his boots the helm a [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=115.64s)]
*  change agent someone with no vested interest in certain companies or specific programs or approved narratives [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=120.0s)]
*  CBS News political reporter Torian small is with us now from Capitol Hill [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=128.6s)]
*  So there were several contentious moments during today's hearing most of those contentious moments were were partisan [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=132.04s)]
*  We heard them from Democrats. What moment stood out to you the most? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=137.56s)]
*  Well, Lindsay, I think just about every interaction [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=141.16s)]
*  Hexeth hat with female senators were noteworthy [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  I will say though they were a bit more heated coming from Democratic senators than there were Republican senators [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=147.88s)]
*  I was especially watching senator Joni. I was the Republican of Iowa to see how exactly she would approach this confirmation hearing [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=154.89999999999998s)]
*  She's been pretty non-committal leading up to today's event and she said [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=162.85999999999999s)]
*  She had previously expressed some concerns about the allegations about his treatment of women that he has categorically [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=167.84s)]
*  Denied though. We saw the more fiery [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=175.52s)]
*  Accusations lobbed right back at him from Senator [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=179.56s)]
*  Kirsten Gillibrand of New York saying his words on women in combat were in her mind deplorable [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=183.44s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts also doubling down on that [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=190.96s)]
*  She pointed out that he made this comments just 30 something days ago on a podcast that he believed [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  Women should not be a part of a combat roles in the military [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=200.56s)]
*  She pressed him on why he has now pivoted and said in her words [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  I hope you understand that many women in the military believe that if you convert in 32 days after 32 days when you are confirmed [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=209.12s)]
*  You can reverse right back [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=216.24s)]
*  You had mentioned the exchange between Senator Ernst and Hexeth [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  But there wasn't anything particular in that exchange that I thought this could be damaging for Hexeth [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=222.72s)]
*  In fact, she alluded to several previous conversations with Hexeth and it sort of sounded like maybe her concerns were assuaged a bit by those meetings [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  Is there right now any concern that he might not have the votes after today? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=234.4s)]
*  Well that exchange could be pretty instructive as to how the rest of this process can go for him [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  It's clear that Democrats are pretty upset by how fast this process is moving [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=244.34s)]
*  Several Democrats protested the fact that they didn't get a second round of questioning [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=249.56s)]
*  For him in this hearing but when it comes to Ernst, like I said before she was pretty non-committal [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=254.88000000000002s)]
*  She had some pause about the allegations against him when it comes to women [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  She focused instead on some of the things she agreed with in her [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=264.0s)]
*  Crossfire or a grilling of Hexeth in this hearing. She said that she agreed with him when it comes to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=268.68s)]
*  auditing the department and she said based on the several sit-down [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  Conversations she's had with him in private that they seem to be eye to eye on that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=279.48s)]
*  She did give him an opportunity to respond to some of those allegations [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=283.04s)]
*  But by comparison she definitely although she said she did not pull her punches in private [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  She definitely did not operate with such fiery [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  Motive behind it that we've seen but from some of these few other women on the panel here [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=297.20000000000005s)]
*  What is next for Hexeth and what is next on Capitol Hill as these confirmation proceedings continue [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=302.08s)]
*  Well, we're told that he's set to still meet with other members of the Senate throughout the rest of his tenure before a [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=308.08s)]
*  confirmation vote is set to happen [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=316.2s)]
*  Other Trump nominees will also have to endure this process. We know that Pam Bondi Christine Noem [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=318.44s)]
*  I believe John Ratcliffe Sean Duffy are all set to have confirmation hearings on the hill this week as well [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=324.56s)]
*  So it's gonna be a very busy time for many Trump picks looking to get their stamps of approval from members of Senate [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=330.96s)]
*  But Hexeth by far is one of the more embattled and controversial picks [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=338.84s)]
*  It's unclear whether or not he has the numbers [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  But we know that Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins two Republicans who have also been pretty non-committal have yet to say whether or where they will [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=345.71999999999997s)]
*  Vote once the time comes they said they were waiting for this hearing to happen for them to form their judgment [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  So we're going we're going to be hounding them for an answer before that vote happens to see where the votes may lay [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=360.56s)]
*  Torian small. Thank you [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rm1J8V8X7Y&t=367.32s)]
