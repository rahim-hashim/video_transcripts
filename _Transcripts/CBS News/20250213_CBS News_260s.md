# Purge of government employees underway at FBI and other agencies
**CBS News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4)
*  Now, as we focus on Cash Patella's confirmation process, I want to bring in CBS News Department [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=0.0s)]
*  Justice correspondent Scott McFarlane to talk a little bit more about this. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=4.16s)]
*  So, Scott, what are you hearing from your sources about these firings at the FBI? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=7.08s)]
*  SCOTT MCFARLANE, CBS NEWS DEPARTMENT JOURNALIST, CBS NEWS DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, CASH PATELLAS [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=11.120000000000001s)]

*  CURRESPONDENT, SCOTT MCFARLANE, CBS NEWS DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, CASH PATELLAS CONFIRMATION PROCESS [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  CURESPONDENT, CBS NEWS DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, CASH PATELLAS CONFIRMATION PROCESS [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  already been this list compiled of FBI agents and employees who were part of the January [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=15.12s)]
*  6 investigation. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=21.119999999999997s)]
*  That's about 5,000 people, any number of whom are concerned they're about to get fired simply [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=22.24s)]
*  for touching that case. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=27.96s)]
*  But there's now an expanding concern. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=30.18s)]
*  There's been already in the past 24 hours this move against other agency federal workers [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=33.12s)]
*  who are what they call probationary, new to the job, without the full protections of a [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=37.64s)]
*  longtime civil servant. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=42.48s)]
*  There's a lot of FBI agents who fit that category too, potentially more than 1,000 FBI agents [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=44.4s)]
*  who the federal government considers probationary, new, without full protections. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=50.08s)]
*  An association representing FBI employees issued a warning last night saying if you [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  move against all of those workers, you could lose another 1,000 FBI agents, which would [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  gut some of the critical task forces and missions inside the FBI. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=65.98s)]
*  It could be child predator task forces, terrorism task forces, violent crime task forces, and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=71.28s)]
*  a significant loss of institutional memory and an awful lot of time would be needed, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=78.36s)]
*  Vlad, to find, recruit, train, background check, replacement FBI agents. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=83.8s)]
*  So that's making Americans less safe. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=90.64s)]
*  And as you know, Scott, oftentimes with these FBI agents and with the department, the Federal [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=92.56s)]
*  Bureau of Investigation, we don't hear about the wins. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=97.86s)]
*  We only hear about the failures, which are, thank God, few and far between. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=101.1s)]
*  But this signals that we may see a bit more of those in the years ahead. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=104.46s)]
*  Let me ask you about this bizarre press conference that the attorney general, Pam Bondi, held [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=109.17999999999999s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=112.86s)]
*  The Department of Justice, as you know, announced that it's suing New York State over its immigration [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=113.86s)]
*  policies. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=117.94s)]
*  But the way that the attorney general led that press conference by announcing that she [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=118.94s)]
*  had filed charges against individuals in New York State led a lot of people, including [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=124.25999999999999s)]
*  myself, not being a lawyer to wonder if she was filing criminal charges against people [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=129.34s)]
*  like Letitia James. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=133.58s)]
*  And instead, we find out that she's just suing them and she actually hasn't filed anything. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=134.58s)]
*  What more can you tell us? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=138.54s)]
*  It was an untraditional news conference. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=139.9s)]
*  I was in the room at the Department of Justice. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=142.28s)]
*  There was a gasp among those in the audience on press row when she initially indicated [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=144.22s)]
*  there'd be criminal charges against the governor and other key players in New York State. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=150.66s)]
*  And she immediately clarified that this is a civil lawsuit. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=155.46s)]
*  The likes of which there are thousands and tens of thousands across the country, including [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=158.94s)]
*  in New York each year. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=162.38s)]
*  They also did not have a copy of the lawsuit to share during this press conference. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=164.98000000000002s)]
*  That's untraditional, but it also sowed some confusion about what exactly is being alleged [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=170.72s)]
*  here and what type of damages is the U.S. Department of Justice seeking. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=174.9s)]
*  Some of that's going to be clarified at a federal courthouse in Albany, the state capital [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=179.38s)]
*  where the state government is headquartered, as the Department of Justice tries to make [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=183.70000000000002s)]
*  an argument here that the state of New York is not cracking down hard enough on undocumented [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=187.78s)]
*  immigrants. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=193.38s)]
*  If this lawsuit goes anywhere is a different story, but a political message has been sent. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=194.9s)]
*  The first message by this attorney general at that podium in this administration. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=198.82s)]
*  So just Scott, so I understand there's nothing there's no paperwork yet. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=204.54s)]
*  Nothing has actually been filed. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=209.06s)]
*  This is an intention to sue or or they have already filed a paperwork that suggests that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=210.22s)]
*  they are suing the governor and others, but but they're not filing any criminal charges. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=215.06s)]
*  This is what's different, Vlad. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=220.58s)]
*  This suit was not ready when it was announced. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=221.74s)]
*  That's uncommon among federal prosecutors. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=224.54s)]
*  It was made available late last night to some reporters, CBS News included. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=227.4s)]
*  We expected to hit the public docket today in Albany, but this will take weeks and months, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=232.14000000000001s)]
*  maybe years to litigate and adjudicate. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=236.98000000000002s)]
*  There's no criminal component to this case. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=239.54s)]
*  When the press conference began with an allusion to criminal charges, it was a misspeaking [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=242.88s)]
*  or a miscommunication by the attorney general. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=248.57999999999998s)]
*  All right, Scott McFarland, always grateful for you, my friend, for providing that clarity [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=250.94s)]
*  that I and I guess a lot of other people sorely need. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=255.57999999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Scott. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=258.26s)]
*  Thanks, Vlad. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY7xYjk3x4&t=259.26s)]
