# Trump takes credit for Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal
**CBS News:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI)
*  CBS News political reporter Aaron Navarro joins us now from West Palm Beach. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=0.0s)]
*  Aaron, let's go back to our other big story of the day. President-elect Trump [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=4.32s)]
*  taking credit for the ceasefire deal that was just announced out of the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=7.92s)]
*  Middle East. Help us understand what his role was in making this happen. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=12.0s)]
*  Yeah, in Trump's Truth Social Post where he said this would not have happened [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=18.48s)]
*  had he not won this past November, he credits his envoy to the Middle East, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=22.72s)]
*  Steve Witkoff, a prominent American investor who had been working with Biden officials in the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=28.279999999999998s)]
*  Middle East to get this deal done. Witkoff had met with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  in recent weeks and even Qatar's Prime Minister noted that the collaboration between Trump's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  transition team and President Biden's advisors and officials out there in the Middle East showed [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=46.36s)]
*  that America had unified message and support for a ceasefire deal. But Trump also in his [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Truth Social Post saying that he, Israel and allies will quote, make sure Gaza never again [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=57.56s)]
*  becomes a terrorist safe haven, saying he would use this moment to build on the Abraham Accords [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=63.64s)]
*  passed in his first term. But certainly implementing the ceasefire deal, getting to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=69.56s)]
*  a permanent ceasefire deal is now on the desk of the incoming president. And we understand that as [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=74.28s)]
*  Mr. Trump jumps back into the White House next week, he's prepared to issue more than 100 [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=81.48s)]
*  executive orders on his first day. What do we know about that? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=87.08s)]
*  Yeah, just let's look at precedent really quick. Day one of his first term in 2017, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  55 executive orders, 221 executive orders in total during that first term. And from what we've seen [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=97.24s)]
*  in reports and heard from allies, he's now trying to do 100 in his first day with a big focus on [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=104.36s)]
*  immigration at the southern border. Things like reinstituting Title 42, the COVID era [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=110.36s)]
*  rule when it comes to immigration at southern border that blocked migrants from applying for [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=117.72s)]
*  asylum. But we'll see if things like his mass deportation plan will be borne out in these [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=122.6s)]
*  executive orders. We know that there have been governors looking to challenge that from the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=128.68s)]
*  other side of the aisle. And it raises potential legal issues that may not be so simply solved, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=133.16s)]
*  or at least impacted by one executive order. And in our last few seconds with you, Aaron, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=139.48s)]
*  who will and won't be at Trump's inauguration? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  Carrie Underwood, Lee Greenwood, some of the musical names that will be there along with Elon [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=148.44s)]
*  Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. One person that will not be there, she was not at Jimmy Carter's funeral, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=152.6s)]
*  is former first lady Michelle Obama, who said after she attended Trump's first inauguration [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=160.04s)]
*  in 2017 that she was not in a good mood and decried the lack of diversity on that stage. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=165.48s)]
*  She will not be in attendance at Trump's inauguration on Monday, but former President [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=171.72s)]
*  Barack Obama, he will be there. Aaron Navarro with the latest for us at a West Palm Beach. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=175.95999999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Aaron. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv9LChc60aI&t=180.67999999999998s)]
