# Trump to focus on tariffs and economy in address to Congress
**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80)
*  Hello everyone, I'm Major Garen in Washington. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to our special coverage of President Trump's address to Congress. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=2.0s)]
*  In just four hours, the President will speak to both chambers, the House and the Senate, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  invited guests, and quite obviously, a curious global audience. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=9.68s)]
*  In this speech, he will describe his vision for America's future. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=14.52s)]
*  There'll be economics in there, immigration, international policy, probably a lot more. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=17.88s)]
*  Worth reminding ourselves that just six weeks ago, Mr. Trump became only the second president [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=23.28s)]
*  in this nation's history to be sworn in for a second non-consecutive term, the other being [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  Democrat Grover Cleveland. And it has been, within the Trump White House, a very busy six weeks. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=33.84s)]
*  Already, we have seen dramatic cuts within the size of the federal workforce, set in motion [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=40.56s)]
*  by Elon Musk and done so with the acceptance and vocal encouragement of the President. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=46.64s)]
*  There have been a great number of executive orders, more than 70 in fact, and at least for [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  the moment, an order by the President to pause military aid to Ukraine. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=56.96s)]
*  And just last night, at about midnight, here on the East Coast, sweeping tariffs went into effect [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=63.28s)]
*  against America's three largest trading partners, Canada, Mexico, and China. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=68.08s)]
*  For their part, Canada and China have already launched retaliatory tariffs. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=73.68s)]
*  The Mexican government has vowed to respond within the week. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=77.84s)]
*  These actions have, at least for the moment, plunged the United States into what can only [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=81.36s)]
*  be described as a full-blown trade war. The stock market went down today as investors [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=86.08s)]
*  try to figure out just how long this trade conflict will continue. President Trump said [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=92.08s)]
*  these tariffs are necessary to level the economic playing field internationally and here at home. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=97.2s)]
*  And he also hopes it will encourage Canada, Mexico, and principally China [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=102.96s)]
*  to stop the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States. I want to start our special coverage [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=107.12s)]
*  with CBS News congressional correspondent, Kaitlyn Huey Burns, on Capitol Hill, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  and CBS News senior White House correspondent, Weijia Jiang, at the White House. Weijia, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  let me play for you in the audience something that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=121.28s)]
*  in remarks after the tariffs went into effect against Canada and Mexico. Let's get that on the, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=125.92s)]
*  let's listen to that. Now it's not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal, but Donald, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=134.16s)]
*  they point out that even though you're a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  Weijia, the reaction at the White House to the to the tariffs and how they will [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=149.36s)]
*  factor in if at all in tonight's address. Well, I just got out of some source meetings here at the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=153.36s)]
*  White House, Major, and the president is expected to devote a significant portion of his speech [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=160.32s)]
*  tonight on the economy and he will talk about tariffs. Of course, he made this decision [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=166.56s)]
*  yesterday on the eve of this massive speech. It's not an accident because he wanted to have [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=172.88s)]
*  key deliverables to show that he is doing things to impact the U.S. economy. Now, whether that is [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=178.48s)]
*  positive or negative, that is not for us to decide, but you can see how the market is reacting. You [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=185.6s)]
*  can see in various studies on consumer confidence that it is having an impact on spending already [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=192.24s)]
*  and on how people perceive the economy. But the president insists that this is necessary [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=199.52s)]
*  because he says this is not just about tariffs. It's about using it as a tool to force our [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  neighbors, Canada and Mexico, to do more on the fentanyl crisis, to stop the flow of that illegal [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=211.84s)]
*  drug into the U.S. But Major, it's important to note, and it's something that Trudeau himself [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=218.16s)]
*  pointed out, that the amount of fentanyl that comes from our northern border is less than half [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=222.64s)]
*  of percent of all the fentanyl that comes through into the United States. So he is asking why Canada [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=228.72s)]
*  is still being punished in this way. Now, what's interesting, Major, is that Trudeau went on to say [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=236.32s)]
*  that there will be retaliatory tariffs on American exports, and the president posted on Truth Social [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  that if that happens, he's just going to raise the amount of tariffs on Canadian imports. So for you [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=250.24s)]
*  to say that this is pretty much an all-out trade war, Major, is absolutely correct. How that's going [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=256.32s)]
*  to have an impact on the economy, it already is, but the longer-term impact we'll have to see. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=261.36s)]
*  The prime minister said those tariffs on U.S. imports to Canada will be on $150 billion of those, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=267.12s)]
*  $30 billion upfront, and then on $125 billion over time. So it is not a full-blown application of all [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=273.92s)]
*  available tariffs, 25 percent on everything, but 25 percent on $30 billion upfront, and maybe as [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  many as $150 billion over time. Caitlin Huey-Burns on Capitol Hill, to the degree you found out today, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  what has been the reaction among Republicans and Democrats? Well, Major, the president likes to say [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=293.36s)]
*  his favorite word in the dictionary is tariff. He said that over and over on the campaign trail. He [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=300.24s)]
*  said that while he has been president, I can say that that is not the favorite word of most [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=305.92s)]
*  Republicans up here on Capitol Hill, and they're kind of in this difficult position of not wanting [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=310.88s)]
*  to separate themselves from the president very vocally, but they are starting to raise concerns [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=317.28s)]
*  about the impact that this could have on their constituents. We're particularly hearing concerns [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  from Republicans from big farming states, from big manufacturing states, kind of starting to raise [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=328.96s)]
*  their hand and say, look, I'm a little bit concerned about the impact on prices this will have [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  on consumers in my area or on industry in my area. We heard from Senate Majority Leader John [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=339.44s)]
*  Thune today saying, you know, it's no secret that I do not exactly share the sentiment of Trump when [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=346.24s)]
*  it comes to tariffs. However, they are giving him the latitude to use this as a negotiating tactic, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  and that kind of speaks to the overall theme we've seen from Republicans on Capitol Hill [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=360.8s)]
*  throughout this young presidency so far, is that they have disagreements with the president, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=365.36s)]
*  but they don't really vocalize them in kind of on hair on fire types of ways because they're also [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=371.04s)]
*  they also know that their base of supporters are very in line with the president and what he wants [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=376.72s)]
*  to do. So they're giving him time, leeway, and some deference on this, even though it's not really [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=382.16s)]
*  a traditionally conservative standpoint. We reach back to you at the White House, some developments [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=388.40000000000003s)]
*  on the Ukraine front today, and clearly that will be part of the president's speech tonight as well. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  Major, I will get to that in a second, but the beauty of live television and breaking news is [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=397.36s)]
*  that you never know when it's going to come. And we just learned that the president's commerce [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=404.08000000000004s)]
*  secretary, Howard Lutnick, said that as soon as tomorrow there could be announcement that the U.S. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=408.24s)]
*  is going to reduce the amount, the percentage of tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Of course, it's at 25% [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=414.56s)]
*  now. We don't know what it will be reduced to. We know that he said it's not going to be paused [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=421.91999999999996s)]
*  or eliminated, but we do expect that number to go down. We also know that one thing Trump pays a lot [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=427.28s)]
*  of attention to is the stock market. And so this has to be, at least in part, a reaction to those [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=432.64s)]
*  tumbling numbers. Yes, as far as Ukraine and foreign policy goes, that is another big portion [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=439.35999999999996s)]
*  of what the president is supposed to talk about tonight. And when I say he wanted to have something [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=446.8s)]
*  to be able to present the American people, that is the pause of Ukrainian aid by the U.S. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=451.92s)]
*  As the administration says in their words, contemplates to make sure that any money that [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=458.56s)]
*  goes out is going to go toward a solution. Of course, President Trump has been pushing for a [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=463.68s)]
*  quick ceasefire, and that's not exactly what Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=468.72s)]
*  agreed to. But I will say Zelensky issued a lengthy statement. He stopped short of apologizing, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=474.64s)]
*  but agreed it was time to get things back on track, Major. And it might also augur well for [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=480.0s)]
*  the signing of that thing last Friday that was supposed to be signed at the White House, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=486.32s)]
*  a minerals deal between the United States and Ukraine. We'll keep very close attention to that. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=491.28s)]
*  That's why we said at the top of the show, investors were curious just how long this trade war [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=495.68s)]
*  would last. It sounds like there's already some reassessment from the commerce secretary [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=500.16s)]
*  and the administration. Major Jang at the White House, Caitlin Huey-Burns on Capitol Hill, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=504.40000000000003s)]
*  thank you very much. I want to bring in our political reporter panel, Jasmine Wright and [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=508.32000000000005s)]
*  Daniella Diaz. Jasmine is a politics reporter for Notis, and Daniella is a congressional reporter [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=512.24s)]
*  for Notis. Remember, Notis News of the U.S. So, Jasmine, great to see you. What do you expect [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=517.52s)]
*  in the speech tonight? Well, you know, we had a report out today that no matter what the substance [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=523.36s)]
*  is, obviously it's about America renewal. The White House says President Trump is going to talk [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=528.72s)]
*  about what he believes are his accomplishments in just these 30 plus days, also kind of level set [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=534.08s)]
*  what the country has gone through the last four years and how he views the way forward to change [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=540.48s)]
*  it to really bring forth his America first agenda. But I think what might be the most interesting part [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=546.0s)]
*  of it is not just what he says, but how he says it. If you remember, Major, when Trump entered [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=551.2s)]
*  the White House in 2017, he gave his first joint address to Congress. He really was taking kind of [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=557.2s)]
*  a more solemn tone, trying to reintroduce himself to America and say basically to Republicans and [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=562.6400000000001s)]
*  Democrats, let's put away the trivial fights. This time around, that is not the Trump that we're [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=568.4000000000001s)]
*  going to see. We're going to see what one source told me was an impassioned Trump, one that's not [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=573.12s)]
*  using flowery language, but is talking directly to the Republican Congress and to the American [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=578.32s)]
*  people, basically showing that he is the president and it is his country under his rule and they [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=583.2s)]
*  basically should acquiesce to what he wants to do. And the things he is aggressively trying to [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=588.8000000000001s)]
*  set in motion and why. Danielle, you had some interesting reporting about advice given from [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=592.24s)]
*  senior House Republican leaders to the rank and file House Republicans about how they should [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=598.4000000000001s)]
*  possibly avoid town halls because in some instances they become a little unruly. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=603.5200000000001s)]
*  Danielle That's exactly right, Major. It was really interesting to hear from these Republicans [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=608.56s)]
*  during that closed door meeting that took place this morning off campus. It was a political meeting [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=614.2399999999999s)]
*  where Richard Hudson, who of course is the NRCC chair, the campaign arm for House Republicans, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=619.5999999999999s)]
*  was telling rank and file to not host in-person town halls because as we've seen in the last two [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=624.64s)]
*  weeks, a lot of these town halls have had disgruntled constituents who have been speaking [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=631.04s)]
*  out against a lot of these cuts that we're seeing coming from Elon Musk, the Trump advisor and [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=636.24s)]
*  billionaire who is part of Doge and making cuts to the federal government. They've been speaking [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=641.2s)]
*  out and they also say that instead maybe they should be holding tele-town halls or Facebook [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=645.84s)]
*  Lives to avoid a lot of the conflict. Now, of course, Republicans pointing to all of these [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=652.0s)]
*  constituents being angry activists from Indivisible, from Move On, Trump of course [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=657.76s)]
*  posting on Truth Social that they're actually paid activists. That is of course is not clear, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=664.48s)]
*  but it is an interesting move from leadership to advise Republicans not to have more viral moments [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=670.72s)]
*  that are creating of course negative attention for Republicans as they're trying to push their agenda. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=676.5600000000001s)]
*  Mike And Danielle, as I understand it, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=681.04s)]
*  Elon Musk and House Republicans are going to meet tomorrow evening to hash out some of these matters. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=683.2s)]
*  Danielle That's exactly right. We are aware that the [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=689.12s)]
*  ultra conservative caucus, freedom caucus members are going to go to the White House and meet [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=692.64s)]
*  with Donald Trump. Now, the biggest thing happening right now on the this during the [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=697.6800000000001s)]
*  State of the Union or excuse me, joint address is technically not a State of the Union, but [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=702.32s)]
*  Trump's joint address to the Congress is that there's a upcoming government funding deadline [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=705.9200000000001s)]
*  that they need to address that they still don't have a plan for. And that is, of course, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=711.6s)]
*  on March 14th, government funding is going to run out major and they're trying to figure out how to [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=716.88s)]
*  get conservatives on board with a continuing resolution or some sort of stopgap measure to [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=720.8000000000001s)]
*  fund the government at its current levels so they can continue working on appropriations, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=726.72s)]
*  bills and cutting government funding. So there will be meetings where Donald Trump is going to [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=730.4000000000001s)]
*  really try to advise rank and file members, conservatives in the conference to go along [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=734.8000000000001s)]
*  with his plan for a CR so that they can work on their priorities. But of course, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=740.48s)]
*  important to remember, a lot of them are going to be here tonight, including Elon Musk, who is [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=745.6s)]
*  expected to be in the chamber for the first time with this Republican trifecta. You know, they have [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=749.36s)]
*  the majority in the House and the Senate, so you can really feel the energy here. I'm just outside [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=754.8000000000001s)]
*  the House chamber. So even ahead of tomorrow's meeting, we'll be seeing a little bit of that [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=759.0400000000001s)]
*  tonight. Major Jasmine, to Danielle's point, this is now a speech in part to shift to the legislative [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=763.0400000000001s)]
*  part of the mechanics because executive orders have effect. They're meaningful. There have been [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=769.52s)]
*  a lot of them. Trump will speak to all of that. He's got to turn in a legislative direction to [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=774.56s)]
*  get the other things on his agenda moving forward. Yeah, I mean, it's incredible, Major. If you think [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=779.1999999999999s)]
*  about the fact that so far in office, I mean, he's been in office for five weeks, I think. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=783.5999999999999s)]
*  He's already signed over 75 executive orders, eclipsing both his record when he first started [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=788.3199999999999s)]
*  in office, Joe Biden's record when he first started in office, really kind of pushing [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=794.3199999999999s)]
*  the limits in some respects on where or how much presidential power he can use. But you're right, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=799.36s)]
*  it does have to shift into that legislative area. He has often talked about wanting Congress to pass [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=805.28s)]
*  one beautiful big bill that has all of his, what he wants to do with his America First agenda, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=810.88s)]
*  from border security to extending those tax cuts to making sure that some of, you know, trying to [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=817.04s)]
*  keep okay Medicare and Social Security, but still pushing some of the things that he wants to see [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=824.72s)]
*  done. But of course, this Congress is really fractured within the Republican Party, and Democrats [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=829.4399999999999s)]
*  have basically said that they do not want to help Trump in any manner so far. And so they're really [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=835.04s)]
*  going to have to lean on all sides of their Republican Party to try to get something passed. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=840.0s)]
*  And I think it's going to be really, really difficult for them, even though they've kind of [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=846.0s)]
*  passed the first step, which is putting forth that framework through the House. Jasmine Wright, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=849.4399999999999s)]
*  Danielle Diaz. Thank you very much. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZurFhnwFQ80&t=853.52s)]
