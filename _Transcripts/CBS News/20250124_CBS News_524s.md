# Anthony Scaramucci discusses Trump's cryptocurrency push
**CBS News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg)
*  Welcome back to American Decides. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=0.0s)]
*  Anthony Scaramucci was once inside the Trump inner circle, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=1.56s)]
*  then he was on the outside, and basically since then, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=4.36s)]
*  kind of a critic, an observer, but mostly involved [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=7.04s)]
*  in all the financing and questions and regulations [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  surrounding cryptocurrency. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=14.56s)]
*  Let's bring in Anthony Scaramucci, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=17.32s)]
*  who served ever so briefly [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=18.8s)]
*  as White House Communications Director [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=20.78s)]
*  during the first Trump presidency. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=22.52s)]
*  His new book, The Little Book of Bitcoin, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=24.32s)]
*  comes out next month. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=27.12s)]
*  Anthony, great to see you. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=28.68s)]
*  He comes to us via Zoom from Manhasset, New York. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=29.6s)]
*  Do me a glossary check, Anthony. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=33.92s)]
*  Bitcoin, stablecoin, memecoin, tokens, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=37.64s)]
*  are they all the same thing? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=40.44s)]
*  No, and so what Bitcoin really is, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=43.36s)]
*  and without giving up too much detail [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=46.56s)]
*  on television to bore people, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=48.6s)]
*  but it's become a durable, stable, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=50.0s)]
*  long-term store of value. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=54.6s)]
*  And I say stable because it's never been hacked, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=56.68s)]
*  it's sort of impregnable, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=59.8s)]
*  and it's scarce and it's immutable. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  It's volatile though, and it goes up and down [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=63.84s)]
*  as the society is adopting Bitcoin. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=66.92s)]
*  We've experienced high volatility in Bitcoin, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=70.2s)]
*  but it's the best performing asset over the last 10 years. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=72.84s)]
*  And so if you read something like Neil Ferguson's book, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=75.88s)]
*  The Ascent of Money, it checks all of the boxes [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=78.52s)]
*  of what human beings like in their money [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=81.68s)]
*  in terms of using it as a technology [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  to trade goods and services with each other. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=86.68s)]
*  A memecoin is really just a gambling token. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=89.36s)]
*  It has a blockchain technology to it, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  and you can transfer it back and forth to each other, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=95.88000000000001s)]
*  but it really doesn't have that much value, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=99.48s)]
*  and it hasn't really been adapted [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=101.2s)]
*  by the mainstream financial institutions. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  And you mentioned some other things. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=106.56s)]
*  Those are also security-like instruments [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=107.84s)]
*  in the world of technology, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=111.4s)]
*  but nothing is as durable or as sustainable as Bitcoin. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=113.44s)]
*  And President Trump, right before Inauguration Day, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=118.2s)]
*  created his own memecoin. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=121.08s)]
*  What is your reaction to that? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=123.16s)]
*  Well, you know, listen, I would ask people [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  to read the Wall Street Journal's editorial yesterday [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=128.96s)]
*  just describing the great conflict of interest [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=131.8s)]
*  that that represents. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=135.72s)]
*  And so Mr. Trump is basically setting up a gambling token [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=136.64s)]
*  48 hours before he becomes the most powerful person [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=140.16s)]
*  in the world. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=144.0s)]
*  And so that token rose in value. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=144.84s)]
*  When down in value, people are trading that token [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=147.04s)]
*  around the world. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=149.88s)]
*  And I think its fully diluted market capitalization [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=151.28s)]
*  is about 35 billion. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=154.08s)]
*  Mr. Trump controls 80% of that coin. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=156.28s)]
*  So there's a notional value there of $24 billion. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  Of course, he's locked into the coin for three years. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  But, you know, listen, this is not something [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=165.76s)]
*  that I think any of us like [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=168.68s)]
*  because it's a direct conflict of interest [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=170.36s)]
*  of what he's doing. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=172.68s)]
*  And it will create a central clearing station [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  as the Wall Street Journal points out. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=176.24s)]
*  You could end up in a situation [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=179.68s)]
*  where somebody could pay him to do things for them [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=181.08s)]
*  through that token. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=183.96s)]
*  Now I'm not suggesting anybody's doing that, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=184.8s)]
*  but it's just the appearance of that impropriety [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=187.32s)]
*  I think weakens the presidency. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=190.32s)]
*  And it also puts his commissioner to be [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=191.88s)]
*  or nominated commissioner Atkins at risk now [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=194.84s)]
*  when he's testifying because they'll be saying to him, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=199.44s)]
*  he's generally been a pro crypto person. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=201.68s)]
*  As you know, I'm a pro crypto person, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=203.48s)]
*  but he'll be saying, well, aren't you just acting [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=206.2s)]
*  in the personal interest of the president of the United States [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=208.16s)]
*  instead of the interest of the country? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=211.2s)]
*  So I wish he didn't do that, but you know, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=212.8s)]
*  with Donald Trump, you get the entire buffet table [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=215.72s)]
*  of Trump, you get some of the griff [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=218.12s)]
*  with some of the good business policies [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=220.12s)]
*  and it's disappointing to see. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=222.52s)]
*  But go to the Wall Street Journal. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=223.96s)]
*  They blister President Trump with an analysis [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=226.2s)]
*  of what he did and how bad it actually is. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=229.6s)]
*  Anthony, on November 5th, the market trading value [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=231.88s)]
*  of Bitcoin was $68,317. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=235.12s)]
*  As we speak, it is 106,269. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=237.88s)]
*  What does that tell us? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=241.28s)]
*  Well, it tells you that those, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=243.96s)]
*  well tells you I should probably buy a Christmas gift [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=245.32s)]
*  from Donald Trump actually, that's an aside, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=247.28s)]
*  but what it tells you in real time is that those prices [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=249.2s)]
*  were probably suppressed during the Biden administration. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=252.88s)]
*  You know, the administration had a very [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=256.36s)]
*  anti-crypto policies in place. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  A lot of them were arbitrary and capricious [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=261.76s)]
*  and don't go by me, those are actually court cases [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=264.24s)]
*  that were won by the crypto industry. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=267.24s)]
*  And so I think the normalization of regulation [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=270.24s)]
*  that's gonna happen in the Trump administration [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=275.08s)]
*  is unleashed this price discovery. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=277.08s)]
*  And so I like to tell people that those prices [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=279.08s)]
*  would have been the 2022 prices had Gary Gensler [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=283.47999999999996s)]
*  had just followed the administrative law [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=286.68s)]
*  and processed and approved the Bitcoin Cash ETF [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=289.47999999999996s)]
*  way back in 2022, but he decided not to do that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=292.76s)]
*  He got brutalized in court, lost several cases, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=296.36s)]
*  was forced to put the Bitcoin ETF on the ledger. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=300.24s)]
*  The best, most successful ETF launch in history major [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=303.44s)]
*  back in January of last year. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=307.4s)]
*  And so these prices for Bitcoiners like me, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=309.0s)]
*  people that really study this market, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=312.16s)]
*  they're fairly valued prices. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=313.76000000000005s)]
*  And we predict that Bitcoin will probably end the year [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=316.56s)]
*  closer to 200,000 and not anywhere near the prices [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  that it's trading at right now. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=325.68s)]
*  Anthony, what did it mean within this larger conversation [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=327.68s)]
*  and the people who love and trade in digital currencies [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=331.24s)]
*  for president Trump to pardon Russ Ulbricht this week? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=335.0s)]
*  So the original people sort of that OG, like they say, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=338.52s)]
*  the original group of people that were early stage [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=343.96s)]
*  Bitcoiners were thrilled with that decision. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=346.8s)]
*  Mr. Ulbricht, if you will, got life imprisonment [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=349.24s)]
*  with no opportunity to parole. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=353.96s)]
*  And he was a little bit of a nerdy guy [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=356.36s)]
*  that created this thing called the Silk Road. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=358.64s)]
*  The Silk Road sort of exploded and got used for [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=361.76s)]
*  all different types of nefarious things, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=365.72s)]
*  including money laundering and arms sales and et cetera. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=368.64s)]
*  Drug transactions. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=371.64s)]
*  Yeah, exactly, drug transactions. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=373.6s)]
*  He got prosecuted for the creation of this thing. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=375.32s)]
*  Big mistake on his part. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=379.68s)]
*  A lot of people in the cryptocurrency industry felt [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=381.6s)]
*  that he was over prosecuted, if you will, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=384.24s)]
*  or that sentence of a lifetime imprisonment [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=386.52s)]
*  for a 29 year old was unjust. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=388.92s)]
*  Mr. Trump heard their pleas and he pardoned them [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=392.12s)]
*  in the first week of his second term of his presidency. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=395.48s)]
*  So I'm not as close to that situation [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=398.64000000000004s)]
*  as some of the OG people are. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=402.12s)]
*  I got to Bitcoin in 2020. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=403.72s)]
*  Ross and the other guys got there in 2009, 10. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=408.36s)]
*  So I'm not as familiar with the facts yet, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=412.24s)]
*  but I can tell you that there's Bitcoiners, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=414.64000000000004s)]
*  the original Bitcoiners are very pleased [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=416.64000000000004s)]
*  with that decision by Donald Trump to pardon him. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=418.48s)]
*  Anthony, you know President Trump somewhat well. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=421.52000000000004s)]
*  You know those in his inner circle. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=424.36s)]
*  What, from your vantage point, is the sell by date [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=425.8s)]
*  of the Elon Musk, Donald Trump relationship? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=428.92s)]
*  Well, listen, the president is telling people [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=434.0s)]
*  that he's being patient with Elon [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=437.52s)]
*  and that he thinks Elon will grow tired [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=439.12s)]
*  and less interested in what's going on. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=440.76s)]
*  Of course, now that the president is actually president, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=442.96s)]
*  he's inside the White House [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=446.56s)]
*  and there's a little bit harder access points [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=448.6s)]
*  to a president of the United States [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=451.2s)]
*  than to a president-elect. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=452.92s)]
*  But I guess the real issue, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=454.56s)]
*  and journalists like yourself should be asking this, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=455.64s)]
*  Elon is badged to go in and out of the White House. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=458.08s)]
*  And so he has access and there is talk about him [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=460.6s)]
*  eventually getting an office [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=463.48s)]
*  in the old executive office building. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=464.64s)]
*  And if so, if that's the case, God bless. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=467.0s)]
*  He's a very talented and capable person. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=468.76s)]
*  But I guess the open question would be, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=471.04s)]
*  can you be badged to go into the White House, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=473.15999999999997s)]
*  sit in those policy meetings, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=474.96s)]
*  and also run SpaceX and Tesla and things like X, if you will, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=477.04s)]
*  and so many other companies [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=482.03999999999996s)]
*  that he's brilliantly managed to run, operate, and control. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=483.36s)]
*  So the operating question is, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=487.15999999999997s)]
*  are we going to allow business leaders into the White House [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=490.08s)]
*  and have a dual role like that? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=493.28s)]
*  It sounds like there's a conflict of interest. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=495.96s)]
*  There's probably ethical rules or ethical standards [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=497.96s)]
*  inside of Washington that would probably prevent that. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=501.48s)]
*  And so all I would say to Mr. Musko, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=504.36s)]
*  I think he's a very talented person, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=505.96s)]
*  it could be very helpful [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=508.0s)]
*  in making the government more efficient, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=509.0s)]
*  is to shed his other roles [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=511.28s)]
*  and focus on the role that he's seeking in public service. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=513.64s)]
*  I think it'd be very difficult to group both those roles. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=516.3199999999999s)]
*  Anthony Scaramucci, always a pleasure, sir. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=519.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=521.1999999999999s)]
*  Hey, good to be on with you. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=522.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&t=522.88s)]
