# TikTok creator reacts to Supreme Court ruling upholding law that could ban app
**CBS News:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY)
*  We now want to speak with someone who says they are a victim of this decision. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=0.0s)]
*  Content creator Colin Jones is a business owner bracing for the impact. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=3.0s)]
*  You're the founder and CEO of a Jet charter company, Amalfi Jets. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=7.76s)]
*  I've seen your stuff trending, Colin. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=12.8s)]
*  So help me understand how this decision impacts you and your company. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=15.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day, TikTok's been a fantastic platform. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=22.12s)]
*  I mean, we have 1.9 million followers across it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=25.2s)]
*  So at the end of the day, it's disappointing and it's a big bummer to see it go. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=28.36s)]
*  But at the end of the day, great content does great on all platforms. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=31.68s)]
*  So whether that's on TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Axe, LinkedIn, whatever it is, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=34.76s)]
*  I mean, we look forward to hopefully seeing our 1.9 million followers kind of transition over those platforms as well. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=39.12s)]
*  So what do you plan to do? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=44.959999999999994s)]
*  You know, from what I've, you know, for viewers that don't know, this is based on what I've seen. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=48.599999999999994s)]
*  You record some of your customers' conversations. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=53.32s)]
*  They're calling about how to take private jets and private aircraft and that the behavior is quite outrageous in many cases. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=56.24s)]
*  And that's what gets you engagement. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  But help me understand how TikTok helped you show a different side of your business or even your own comedic side and how you now plan to leverage that elsewhere. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=64.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day, the private aviation industry is very antiquated. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=73.8s)]
*  So being able to kind of give everyone like a under the hood look has been really rewarding. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  And I mean, at the end of the day, yeah, we've got plenty of great new customers from TikTok. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=81.16s)]
*  But at the end of the day, we encourage them to continue following along on our content on the other platforms, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=84.92s)]
*  whether it be even on the AmalfiJets app or our upcoming podcast. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=89.92s)]
*  And again, at the end of the day, like we want people to keep hearing our story, we want to keep putting out great content, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=93.68s)]
*  we want to keep showing the kind of under the look insight into the industry. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=98.6s)]
*  So whether that's on TikTok, Instagram, Facebook or anything else, I mean, we look forward to seeing these people as well. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=102.64s)]
*  You sound like you're taking the news pretty well. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  It probably has a lot to do with your constant customer service role in helping people. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=111.6s)]
*  But there is a difference as far as accessibility and reach and algorithms, even if you go completely to Instagram or even try YouTube, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=116.91999999999999s)]
*  which has its own algorithm. There are challenges ahead for you still, right? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=125.8s)]
*  Correct. Yeah, I mean, the algorithm on the other platforms is definitely not the same as TikTok. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=130.44s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I think this encourages content creators to like to diversify. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=134.56s)]
*  At the end of the day, like if TikTok were to be banned, well, that's a huge bummer. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=138.6s)]
*  Great content can do well on other platforms as well. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=141.6s)]
*  So I think encouraging your loyal fan base to keep following along on other platforms and just to kind of diversify across the board. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=144.24s)]
*  But while it will be disappointing, I mean, obviously it's not a kind of endgame type of situation. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=151.4s)]
*  But I mean, I think this shows the resilience of content creators and of businesses alike. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=157.04s)]
*  And then if you think about just in our own lifetimes, there are people that remember MySpace, there are people that remember Vine. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=162.36s)]
*  These were the top social media platforms for their moment. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=167.6s)]
*  Since you're taking this so well, advice would you give to the TikTokers freaking out right now? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=171.16s)]
*  And I've seen them cry on the app in anticipation of this ruling. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=177.08s)]
*  So what do you say to those people who are really feeling quite emotionally vulnerable? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=181.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, again, I feel for them. We feel for them. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=186.4s)]
*  I know it's obviously going to affect everyone in a completely different way. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=188.52s)]
*  But at the end of the day, if you have great content, great content can perform on other platforms. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=191.16s)]
*  I loved Vine as a kid and I love TikTok. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=195.4s)]
*  So being able to transition into other platforms and keep following along with people you like is really important. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  People get attached to individuals, you know, kind of the authenticity that you provide on these platforms. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  So whether that's on TikTok or on Instagram, I mean, again, like people become attached to that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=208.4s)]
*  And I think they'll kind of follow that wherever that is. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=212.84s)]
*  So I would encourage these content creators to not be discouraged, keep making your content and encourage your followers to find you on the other platforms as well. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=215.52s)]
*  Really useful advice. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=222.8s)]
*  Colin, thanks so much for your time. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=224.44s)]
*  I can't wait until I make enough money to give you a phone call. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=225.88s)]
*  If and when I do, don't record it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=229.28s)]
*  Colin, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=231.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdKNLX3qxFY&t=233.56s)]
