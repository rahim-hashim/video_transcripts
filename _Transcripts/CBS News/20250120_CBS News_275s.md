# Trump signs executive orders after inauguration
**CBS News:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q)
*  Let's go now to President Donald Trump and the five binders that are there and listen in. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=0.0s)]
*  The next one will be 47 sub cabinet level appointments. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=30.0s)]
*  You can hear the president there getting instruction about what he's signing. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=41.0s)]
*  There were 22 cabinet appointments there. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=44.88s)]
*  This is the 47 sub cabinet appointments. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  And you can see the Sharpie is back and what looks like the EKG signature of Donald Trump. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=53.36s)]
*  31 acting designations and appointments. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=60.36s)]
*  31 acting designations and appointments. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=65.36s)]
*  We have 15 commission chairmen and acting chairmen appointments. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=69.36s)]
*  15 chairmen and acting chairmen appointments. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=84.36s)]
*  You have to find out whether one of them is for the Pentagon and the acting secretary of defense. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=92.36s)]
*  These would work with FCC, those nominations. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=98.36s)]
*  Lastly, we have a proclamation ordering that all future inauguration days, including this inauguration day, that flags shall be flown at full blast. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=106.36s)]
*  I was at Jimmy Carter's memorial service. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=122.36s)]
*  I think he'd appreciate the fact that the day you inaugurate a president, the flag should be flying at full blast. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=126.36s)]
*  I think they go back down tomorrow. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=132.36s)]
*  Good acoustics. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=142.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=144.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=145.36s)]
*  We go to the vice president. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=146.36s)]
*  There you hear Senator Klobuchar trying to move it along, saying it's time to get in line and keep everything on schedule. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=151.36s)]
*  Handing out the Sharpies as commemorative pens to everyone. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=158.36s)]
*  Beautiful custom. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=164.36s)]
*  It goes back as long as I can. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=167.36s)]
*  Before that, it was a stagecoach. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=169.36s)]
*  It was beautiful. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=172.36s)]
*  Do you have any reaction to the part of this president Biden did at the last minute? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=177.36s)]
*  I'm not going to discuss it now. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=182.36s)]
*  I think it was unfortunate that he did that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=184.36s)]
*  We won't discuss it now. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=187.36s)]
*  There's plenty of time to discuss. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=188.36s)]
*  And there you see President Trump declining to comment further on the fact that President Biden pardoned members of his own family other than saying it was unfortunate. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=200.36s)]
*  And then moving toward. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=212.36s)]
*  I think he's just getting a briefing on what exactly he's saying. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=217.36s)]
*  But so what that means essentially is we're going to be seeing the executive orders, I think, signed at Capital One Arena in front of his supporters and the estimated 20,000 people that have packed in there. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=220.36s)]
*  And I am told that the interim secretary of defense has been named. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=237.36s)]
*  They will perform the duties of secretary of defense until Hegseth is confirmed or someone is confirmed as the Pentagon chief. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=242.36s)]
*  It's a man by the name of Robert Salas. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=252.36s)]
*  He's currently the deputy director for the Washington headquarters service. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=254.36s)]
*  I mean, that is unfamiliar to me, but there is someone in that position at this hour and back now to Statuary Hall where everyone is seated and waiting for the president to join them. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=259.36s)]
*  And Senator Biden. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjvBoD1Wr3Q&t=272.36s)]
