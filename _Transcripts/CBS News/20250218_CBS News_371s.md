# Former Los Angeles mayoral candidate Rick Caruso on rebuilding after wildfires
**CBS News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8)
*  Welcome back. Thanks for staying with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=0.0s)]
*  As Los Angeles, and this is the only way to describe it, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=2.0s)]
*  grapples on many different levels. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=4.0s)]
*  The after effects, the devastation of last month's wildfires, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=6.0s)]
*  the city, of course, is beginning the process to rebuild. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=9.0s)]
*  You recall, 29 people were killed, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=13.0s)]
*  more than 16,000 structures destroyed, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=15.0s)]
*  and what could very well be the costliest natural disaster in American history. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=17.0s)]
*  In this regard, I spoke with developer Rick Caruso, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=23.0s)]
*  who has created a non-profit to help rebuild the city, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=25.0s)]
*  or at least expedite that process, and asked him off the top [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=28.0s)]
*  what right now is working and what isn't. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=31.0s)]
*  Let me take discourage first, if you don't mind, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=34.0s)]
*  because we're sitting here going into the sixth week after the fire, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=37.0s)]
*  and quite frankly, I don't think there's enough happening. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=41.0s)]
*  And I think I share the frustration of so many people that have lost their homes [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=44.0s)]
*  and lost their businesses and lost their livelihood [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=48.0s)]
*  that they don't see more happening. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=52.0s)]
*  So we need to pick up the pace of action in getting things cleaned up [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=54.0s)]
*  and starting to work towards getting people back in their homes. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=58.0s)]
*  What makes me optimistic is so many people have leaned in. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=61.0s)]
*  Just in announcing this non-profit, we've got some of the best, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=65.0s)]
*  the smartest people in Los Angeles and around the country [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=69.0s)]
*  that are giving their time and their talent with one goal in mind, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=73.0s)]
*  the speed and safety of getting these communities rebuilt [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=77.0s)]
*  in Altadena and in the Palisades. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=80.0s)]
*  So I'm heartened by that, and I think we're going to have some great success. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=83.0s)]
*  It's going to take some time, but we're going to bend the curve [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=87.0s)]
*  and tighten the time frame so people get back to their homes. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=90.0s)]
*  You mentioned the speed, Rick, and it's not fast enough. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=93.0s)]
*  Steven Soboroff, who is the appointed chief recovery officer [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=97.0s)]
*  for the City of Los Angeles, has said rebuilding should be able to begin [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=101.0s)]
*  in 12 to 18 months. Is that a timetable you're satisfied with? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=105.0s)]
*  I think it could be tighter than that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=109.0s)]
*  12 months is maybe realistic, 18 months is not realistic, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=111.0s)]
*  but the way they're starting right now, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=115.0s)]
*  we're not getting a lot of cleanup going on. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=117.0s)]
*  And so there's so much that needs to get done here, right? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=120.0s)]
*  You've got to change the infrastructure in these communities. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=124.0s)]
*  You've got to redo power lines. They need to be put underground. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=127.0s)]
*  You've got to redo water mains, redo streets. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=130.0s)]
*  You are rebuilding two and a half times the size of Manhattan [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=133.0s)]
*  to put it in scale. And so things have to run on parallel tracks. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=138.0s)]
*  And it really, private enterprise, like Steadfast LA, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=143.0s)]
*  that's brought in great private enterprise, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=147.0s)]
*  has to form a public-private partnership with the city, the state, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=150.0s)]
*  the county, and the federal government, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=153.0s)]
*  because if we leave it to government officials alone [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=155.0s)]
*  or those who represent government officials, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=158.0s)]
*  it's just going to take too long. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=160.0s)]
*  So we need the ingenuity, we need the entrepreneurship, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=162.0s)]
*  and frankly, we need this relentless follow-up every single day [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=166.0s)]
*  to make sure a lot of work is getting done [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=170.0s)]
*  and getting done in the right way, getting done efficiently. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=172.0s)]
*  And, Rick, those who might have seen headlines [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=174.0s)]
*  might have come across something from Governor Newsom [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=177.0s)]
*  cutting regulations, easing permits. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=179.0s)]
*  Is that happening at the city level? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=183.0s)]
*  Is it happening at the county level, to your satisfaction? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=185.0s)]
*  Are there things being missed in the regulatory climate? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=187.0s)]
*  I think all of that is good. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=191.0s)]
*  I think the governor's doing some good things. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=193.0s)]
*  The state and the county, the city are doing some good things. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=195.0s)]
*  But here's where private enterprise comes in. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=198.0s)]
*  It's not only about waiving certain things. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=201.0s)]
*  It's about how do you expedite. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=203.0s)]
*  So you need to get your plans approved. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=205.0s)]
*  We're working with Amazon. We're going to be announcing this soon. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=208.0s)]
*  But one of the things we're looking at doing is creating an AI model [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=211.0s)]
*  that reviews people's plans so your plan check happens in a matter of hours [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=214.0s)]
*  and maybe days versus weeks and months. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=220.0s)]
*  Those are the kind of things that we need to integrate right away [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=223.0s)]
*  that will allow construction to start sooner. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=226.0s)]
*  So it's not only waiving things. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=229.0s)]
*  It's how do you move things forward in a more efficient, faster way [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=231.0s)]
*  with all this great technology we have in the United States. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=234.0s)]
*  Let's take advantage of it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=237.0s)]
*  Rick, I know you've shied away from politics, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=239.0s)]
*  but you did run against Mayor Bass in 2022. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=241.0s)]
*  This also seems like a time for some tough love, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=243.0s)]
*  some tough assessments about mistakes made before the fires [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=246.0s)]
*  and an immediate aftermath of them ravaging those two neighborhoods. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=249.0s)]
*  I'd like your thoughts on that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=253.0s)]
*  I think we have a lot of tough questions that should be asked and answered, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=255.0s)]
*  and they should be now. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=259.0s)]
*  In typical career politician form, we're hearing, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=261.0s)]
*  well, we have time to figure things out and look back [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=265.0s)]
*  and figure out why things went so wrong. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=269.0s)]
*  We need to understand that now so it doesn't happen again. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=272.0s)]
*  And more and more that's coming out, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=275.0s)]
*  there was massive failures of leadership both at the elected level [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=277.0s)]
*  and the appointed level that really caused people lives, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=281.0s)]
*  their homes, and their livelihood. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=285.0s)]
*  And I still say, as I said on the first night that this happened, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=287.0s)]
*  most of this, if not completely prevented, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=291.0s)]
*  could have certainly been avoided for the most part. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=294.0s)]
*  And that is playing out to be true as we learn more about what happened [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=296.0s)]
*  in Los Angeles, sadly enough. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=300.0s)]
*  Rick, density and home building is going to be a big part of this. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=303.0s)]
*  It has been said you are opposed to any rebuilding [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=307.0s)]
*  that adds density in terms of low-income housing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=310.0s)]
*  There are those within the city who want more low-income housing, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=313.0s)]
*  and of course you know there's a statewide mandate [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=317.0s)]
*  to increase the availability of low-income housing. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=319.0s)]
*  Specifically, where do you stand on that issue? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=322.0s)]
*  Well, I'm an advocate for low-income housing, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=325.0s)]
*  and we're building low-income housing as a private company. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=327.0s)]
*  So we're big advocates. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=330.0s)]
*  What I've said is now is not the time to mandate it [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=331.0s)]
*  on the backs of people who have lost their homes [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=334.0s)]
*  and lost their communities. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=337.0s)]
*  Instead of mandating it, what I've said to the local officials, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=339.0s)]
*  put together an incentive and say if you build low-income housing, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=342.0s)]
*  you get a density bonus. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=346.0s)]
*  But if you mandate it, I think you create more problems, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=349.0s)]
*  and you're also going to have a community very upset [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=352.0s)]
*  because it's going to slow down the rebuilding process. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=356.0s)]
*  So let's give incentives for people to do the right thing, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=359.0s)]
*  and I think everybody wins in that case. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=362.0s)]
*  Rick Caruso, my interest in this story will not wane. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=365.0s)]
*  We will talk again, sir. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=367.0s)]
*  Thank you very much for your time. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=368.0s)]
*  Thank you, Major. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP5bphMGs-8&t=370.0s)]
