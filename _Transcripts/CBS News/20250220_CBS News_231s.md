# Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says FAA cuts won't affect flight safety
**CBS News:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU)
*  Welcome back. On his first full day as Transportation Secretary, Sean Duffy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=0.0s)]
*  faced the deadliest US aviation accident in more than 20 years. The mid-air [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=5.42s)]
*  collision of a commercial jet and a Army Blackhawk helicopter over Reagan [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=10.02s)]
*  National Airport here in Washington killed 67 people. And just this week, a [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  flight crash-landed in Toronto. All 80 passengers, we are happy to say, survived. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=18.76s)]
*  Our Chris Van Cleave spoke with the Transportation Secretary about these [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=24.72s)]
*  incidents as well as recent layoffs at the Federal Aviation Administration. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=28.66s)]
*  Does it make sense to make cuts at a safety agency that has so much on its [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=34.22s)]
*  plate? So first off, this is a Canadian crash, right? American airline. But let me [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=39.74s)]
*  just put it into context. But there have been five incidents in the last three [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=48.260000000000005s)]
*  weeks. So again, so let's be clear. There's a safety organization, but all the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=51.019999999999996s)]
*  critical safety positions like air traffic controllers and inspectors, all [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=55.82s)]
*  of those positions have been protected. No one's been fired. Actually, we're [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=59.5s)]
*  hiring into those spaces. Not cutting, hiring. Will there be future rounds of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=62.94s)]
*  cuts? There could be. I'm not sure at the FAA, but I think across government. The [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=67.94s)]
*  president's made it clear he wants a more efficient government, a smaller [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=74.7s)]
*  government, a more responsive government. So we'll see how that impacts DOT and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=78.1s)]
*  FAA specifically. Does that make it harder to hire some of those safety [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=83.58s)]
*  critical positions? No. Listen, people want to work. Some people are mission [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=86.94s)]
*  driven, right? So we're a safety organization, as you mentioned. People [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=90.7s)]
*  want to work in this building, in the towers across the country. They have to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=93.82s)]
*  get trained up. But no, I think there's a real drive to be part of the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=97.82s)]
*  mission. This again, going back to safety. I think DOT had a lot of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  priorities that wasn't safety. We're bringing it back to safety. And I think [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=106.02s)]
*  people are motivated by that and want to come in and be part of the movement. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=111.38s)]
*  How do you avoid the potential conflicts of interest with Elon Musk, given that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=114.97999999999999s)]
*  SpaceX is regulated by the FAA? He's been critical of the FAA. And his [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=119.61999999999999s)]
*  companies are a big user of FAA controlled airspace. Yeah. So I was very [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=126.06s)]
*  conscious of anyone who comes in. I don't want to see conflicts of interest. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=129.98s)]
*  So he was talking to air traffic controllers, didn't plug into the system, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=133.78s)]
*  but looked at the terminals that they use, the technology that they use, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=137.78s)]
*  asked them, had a back and forth about what works well for you, what doesn't [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=142.94s)]
*  work well. And they spoke freely about these are the problems that we have. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=147.34s)]
*  And so it was nothing about the way that SpaceX uses the airspace. It was about [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=150.78s)]
*  how do controllers do their job? What kind of technology do they have? And so, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=156.98s)]
*  again, not plugging in, not deciding policy at the FAA. It's again, how can we [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=162.38s)]
*  improve the technology around the stations that you use to control the airspace? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=168.22s)]
*  Is there any indication that you've seen so far that DEI practices factored into [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=172.98s)]
*  this accident? In which one? The DC one, but in any... [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=180.22s)]
*  Again, I'll be specific on things that I want to talk about. I don't want to... [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=186.06s)]
*  There's some spaces I don't want to go into, but I'll just tell you that the one [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=194.1s)]
*  DEI office that DOT had was at FAA. That's now gone. There was a lot of practices [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=197.38s)]
*  that were in place. There was focus on language at the FAA. We had to change the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=205.02s)]
*  phrase cockpit to flight deck. They changed notice to airman to notice to air mission. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=209.22s)]
*  Focusing on language as opposed to focusing on safety goes to show you that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=217.22s)]
*  people didn't understand the mission, that we keep people safe here. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=222.82s)]
*  Our Chris Van Cleave with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffey. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxB5WBCItFU&t=227.94s)]
