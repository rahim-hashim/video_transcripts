# Trump's new shocking comments on Gaza, Russia releases American, more | CBS News 24/7
**CBS News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo)
*  When we have it, you see it. That is the purpose of our streaming show here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=0.0s)]
*  Moments ago, our cameras getting an inside look into that highly anticipated [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=4.2s)]
*  sit down with President Donald Trump and the king of Jordan. Let's listen [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=8.96s)]
*  much. It's an honor to have King Abdullah with us. He's been a friend of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=14.4s)]
*  mine for a long time, actually long before even my first term. And we [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  we've had a great relationship. He's a great gentleman, a great leader, uh, and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=23.32s)]
*  does a fantastic job in his country is his son. We're lucky enough to have his [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=28.8s)]
*  handsome son with us today. So it's good to see you again. We, uh, we've had [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=33.24s)]
*  some quick discussions just now, and we're gonna have some longer discussions [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=39.44s)]
*  after this. And the relationship with Jordan has been very strong, has been [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=42.88s)]
*  with me and I really has been with the country. But I think I've been closer [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=49.3s)]
*  than other presidents to Jordan and what Jordan represents. And it's an [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=53.72s)]
*  honor to have you and your son with us today. And if you'd like to say a few [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=58.32s)]
*  words and thank you very much, thank you very much for having us. And so short [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=62.88s)]
*  after your recognition, I think just as a testament to what you said is a [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=67.32s)]
*  special relationship between our two countries and the person relationship [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=71.22s)]
*  of friendship and trust between the two of us. Mr President, I truly believe [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=75.2s)]
*  that with all the challenges that we have in the Middle East that I finally [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=80.52s)]
*  see somebody that could take us across the finish line to bring stability, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=83.56s)]
*  peace and prosperity to all of us in the region. And it is, I think, our [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=87.84s)]
*  collective responsibility in the Middle East to continue to work with you to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=92.44s)]
*  support you to achieve those lofty goals. So I'm very delighted to be here. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=96.28s)]
*  And as you said, sir, we've got some very interesting discussions. Very [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=99.92s)]
*  good. Very good. Thank you very much. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=102.88s)]
*  Um, many people in the region, especially Jordan, are worried about [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=105.88s)]
*  the annexation of the West Bank. Will you give the His Majesty the King [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=109.44s)]
*  guarantee that you won't allow Israel to annex the West Bank? And how are you [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=113.0s)]
*  I think it's gonna work out very well. That's not really what we're talking [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=117.52s)]
*  about today. I think that's something that's gonna work out automatically, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=120.6s)]
*  and it's in good shape. And we discuss it. Other people have discussed it [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=124.72s)]
*  with us and with me. That's gonna work out. West Bank is gonna work out very [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=130.2s)]
*  well. Why should the king take in the Palestinian people? He's made clear he [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=134.16s)]
*  doesn't want to. Well, I don't know, but he may have just something to say [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=138.2s)]
*  because we discussed just briefly. Uh, I think maybe you want to say it now or [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=141.24s)]
*  well, Mr President, I think we have to keep in mind that there is a plan from [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=147.0s)]
*  Egypt and the Arab countries. We're being invited by Mohammed bin Salman to [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  discussions in Riyadh. I think the point is, is how do we make this work [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=157.0s)]
*  in a way that is good for everybody? Obviously, we have to look at the best [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=160.64s)]
*  interests of of the United States of the people in region, especially to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=165.48s)]
*  my people of Jordan. And we're going to have some interesting discussions [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=169.16s)]
*  today. I think one of the things that we can do right away is take 2000 [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=172.36s)]
*  Children that are either cancer Children or in very ill state to Jordan [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=177.98000000000002s)]
*  as quickly as possible. Um, and then wait for, I think the Egyptians to [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  present their plan on how we can work with the president to work on because [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=187.68s)]
*  of challenges. So you're going to tell me, Excuse me, wait, please. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=192.16000000000003s)]
*  Uh, I didn't know that what you just said 2000 Children with cancer or other [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=197.32s)]
*  problems. And, uh, that's really a beautiful gesture. That's really good. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=202.92s)]
*  And we appreciate it. And we'll be working on the rest with, uh, with [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=208.32s)]
*  Egypt. I think you're gonna see some great progress. I think with Jordan, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=213.64s)]
*  you're gonna see some great progress. Three of us will have some others [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=217.6s)]
*  helping, and we're gonna have some others that are very high level [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=221.01999999999998s)]
*  helping, and the whole thing will come. It's not a complex thing to do. And [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=224.16s)]
*  with the United States being in control of that piece of land, the fairly [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  large piece of land, you're gonna have stability in the Middle East for the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  first time. And the Palestinians or the people that live now in Gaza will be [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  living beautifully in another location. They're gonna be living safely. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=242.04s)]
*  They're not gonna be killed, murdered and having to leave every 10 years [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=245.44s)]
*  because I've been watching this for so many years. It's nothing but trouble. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=249.72s)]
*  Everyone's being killed and being robbed. It's like living in hell, and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=254.88s)]
*  they're gonna end up having a great home, great families that don't have [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=260.8s)]
*  to get mugged and killed and beaten up and harassed by Hamas and everybody [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  else. And I know we'll be able to work something. And what you just [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=271.12s)]
*  said about the 2000 is fantastic. It's so beautiful. It's music to my ears. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=276.96s)]
*  But we're gonna be able to work something. And I know we'll be able to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=282.48s)]
*  work something also with, I believe, not 100% but 99% we're gonna work [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=285.0s)]
*  out something with Egypt. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=292.84s)]
*  How is the US going to own Gaza? Your White House has made clear taxpayer [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=298.8s)]
*  dollars won't be used for this. So what money are you going to use to buy Gaza? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=302.92s)]
*  We're not gonna buy anything. We're gonna have it. We're gonna keep it, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=306.8s)]
*  and we're gonna make sure that there's gonna be peace and there's not gonna be [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=309.8s)]
*  any problem and nobody's gonna question it. And we're going to run it very [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=313.48s)]
*  properly. And eventually we'll have economic development at a very large [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=318.8s)]
*  scale, maybe the largest scale on that site. And we'll have lots of good [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=322.92s)]
*  things built there, including hotels and office buildings and housing and [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=327.36s)]
*  other things. And we'll make that site into what it should be. And the people [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=331.56s)]
*  from Gaza who wouldn't be able to be there for years because you're talking [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=336.0s)]
*  about just to get it and prepare it and to take care of all of the problems [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=339.44s)]
*  that currently it has, as you know, tunnels and people are in those tunnels [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=344.36s)]
*  and you have some good people and some bad people and you may have hostages [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=349.0s)]
*  right now. You know, you have the hostages possibly there. They don't [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=354.12s)]
*  know where they are. And you know, I have a Saturday deadline and I don't [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=357.6s)]
*  think they're gonna make the deadline personally. I think they they want to [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=361.88s)]
*  play tough guy, but we'll see how tough they are. But it's it's gonna be a [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  wonderful thing. It's gonna be wonderful for the Middle East. I think it'll turn [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=370.8s)]
*  the Middle East. I think you're gonna have peace in the Middle East. You're [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=373.76s)]
*  gonna eventually have peace in the Middle East. Couldn't this deadline [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=376.48s)]
*  risk undermining the talks that you're having with the king today? Risk the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=382.24s)]
*  kind of wider piece that you're trying to? Because that's not we're not talking [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=386.92s)]
*  about a big situation. We're talking about something that can go very [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=390.64s)]
*  quickly. We're talking about it's gonna go quickly. It's not gonna take a long [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=393.68s)]
*  time. Okay, that's not gonna take a long time. You know, bullies, you know, the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=397.40000000000003s)]
*  bully is right. You know, the bully I've always and I found it throughout my [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=401.64s)]
*  life. A bully is the weakest person and their bullies. Hamas is bullies. The [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=406.16s)]
*  weakest people are bullies. You know that, right? All right, go ahead. You [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=412.64s)]
*  were saying that Palestinians will live somewhere else safe. Um, where exactly [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=416.78000000000003s)]
*  do you want them to live? Well, it's not where I want them to live. It's gonna be [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=421.76000000000005s)]
*  where we ultimately choose as a group. And I believe we'll have a parcel of [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=425.8s)]
*  land in Jordan. I believe we'll have a parcel of land in Egypt. We may have [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=431.12s)]
*  someplace else. But I think when we finish our talks, we'll have a place [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=436.84000000000003s)]
*  where they're gonna live very happily and very safely. And you know, don't [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=441.32000000000005s)]
*  forget, they only want to be on the Gaza Strip because they don't know [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=445.6s)]
*  anything else. They never had an alternative and they don't want to be [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=450.20000000000005s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip, but they have no choice. They have to be and they're [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=453.52000000000004s)]
*  being killed there at levels that nobody's ever seen. No, no place in the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=457.36s)]
*  world is like as as dangerous as the Gaza Strip. They don't want to be there. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=460.88000000000005s)]
*  They have no alternative when they have an alternative. Not one person will [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=465.34000000000003s)]
*  want to stay where they are. Nobody wants to stay there. They're living in [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=469.06s)]
*  hell. It's a it's a death trap. Mr President, how do you know that the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=472.52000000000004s)]
*  Palestinians don't want to leave their land? Some people say this is ethnic [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=477.6s)]
*  cleansing. You won't be able to force them to leave their land. We're moving [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=481.52000000000004s)]
*  into a beautiful location where they have new homes where they can live [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=485.48s)]
*  safely with their doctors and medical and all of those things. And I think [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=490.96000000000004s)]
*  it's gonna be great. Yeah. Any questions? King of Dilla, what do you think about [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=496.18s)]
*  the U. S. Taking over the concert? Do you want to see the U. S. Own the Gaza [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=499.32000000000005s)]
*  Strip? Well, I think as I said earlier, the president is looking at each [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=502.92s)]
*  of coming to present their plan. As I said, we will be in Saudi Arabia to [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=507.52s)]
*  discuss how we can work with the president and with the United States. So [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=511.91999999999996s)]
*  I think let's wait until the Egyptians could come and present to the president [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=516.42s)]
*  and not get ahead of ourselves. And is there a partial planning Jordan that [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=520.48s)]
*  you're willing to have? Well, I think what we said, I have to look at the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=523.4399999999999s)]
*  best interests of my country. I think the president is very happy that we do [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=527.0799999999999s)]
*  this thing with 2000 Children as quickly as possible. And again, I believe that [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=531.12s)]
*  the president is looking forward to getting a group of us Arabs here to [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=535.92s)]
*  discuss the overall plan. And last question. The 2000 Children. Are those [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=539.68s)]
*  from the Gaza Strip? Absolutely. From the Gaza Strip. You want to change your [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=544.4399999999999s)]
*  mind? That's from the Gaza Strip. The 2000. Are you willing to change your [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=547.76s)]
*  mind if you hear the Egyptian and the Arab plan end of the month? If they [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=551.88s)]
*  present you something different, are you over? I think we sort of have gone [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=556.16s)]
*  down the line. We know pretty much what is going to be presented, and I think [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=560.8s)]
*  it's gonna be something that's gonna be magnificent for the Palestinians. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=566.0799999999999s)]
*  They're gonna they're gonna be in love with it. I did very well with real [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=569.3199999999999s)]
*  estate. I can tell you about real estate. They're gonna be in love with it. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=573.3399999999999s)]
*  But Mr President doesn't concern you that that moving 2 million people from [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=576.3599999999999s)]
*  from there. A very small number of people relative to other things that [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=581.16s)]
*  have taken place over the decades and centuries. It's a very small number of [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=585.0799999999999s)]
*  people, and they're living a terrible life. Look at look at the way they're [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=589.4s)]
*  living now. Nobody's nobody's living like that in the entire world. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=594.52s)]
*  They're living under buildings that are mostly fallen down and will continue to [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=600.28s)]
*  fall down, and they're living under people are being killed every day. The [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=603.9599999999999s)]
*  conditions are horrible. There are no conditions anywhere in the world that [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=608.12s)]
*  are worse than the Gaza Strip right now. But don't you have? You can't [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=612.3199999999999s)]
*  You said all hell will break out if all the hostages are not released on [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=615.88s)]
*  Saturday. What did you mean by that? And are you encouraging Netanyahu to walk [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=620.2s)]
*  away from this deal? Have you talked about this? So I've looked at what at [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=623.76s)]
*  the condition of people coming out of the hostage situation, and it's [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=628.12s)]
*  horrible. I looked at the before and after yesterday. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=633.1600000000001s)]
*  Three young men. One one is dead. Now, as you know, the older gentleman who died, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=638.24s)]
*  which everybody said he was alive and well, he's he's dead. But the three [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=644.0s)]
*  young men and I looked at them from a short while ago and I looked at him now. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=648.4s)]
*  They're emaciated. They look like holocaust survivors. They looked, uh, I [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=653.04s)]
*  mean, they'll get better, but they, uh, they're in rough shape. They were [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=659.56s)]
*  treated really badly, and we've heard things from them since. And I think the [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=663.92s)]
*  reason that Hamas is playing so cute is because they probably they saw the [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=669.06s)]
*  reaction to these three people that came out and the other was up. The one [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=676.14s)]
*  young lady and her hand blown off practically, and they were not in great [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=679.9799999999999s)]
*  shape either, but she's missing her fingers and a big part of her hand. You [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=685.14s)]
*  know what she did? She was stopping a bullet that was aimed at her. She went [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=689.9399999999999s)]
*  like that. That it blew off her hand. Uh, now I think what they're I think they [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=693.94s)]
*  want time because I think the people that they have living are in such bad [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=700.6600000000001s)]
*  shape because they're sending the most healthy people out because they don't [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=704.6600000000001s)]
*  want to send the least healthy people out. And there was an uproar when they [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=709.3000000000001s)]
*  saw the people from yesterday. So these people are so I don't want to do two. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=712.9000000000001s)]
*  And then we do another two in another week, and then we do four and three [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=719.3000000000001s)]
*  weeks now. No, they either have him out by Saturday at 12 o'clock or all bets [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=723.2199999999999s)]
*  are off. Mr President, Mr President, would you still consider withholding [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=729.9s)]
*  aid to those countries if they don't accept your plans to accept? Well, I [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=734.2199999999999s)]
*  don't want to say that because we've had such a good relationship and we're [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=738.02s)]
*  doing so well just in the short time that we've been talking. I mean, uh, the [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=741.5799999999999s)]
*  King just made a statement. I didn't ask him to do that about literally saving [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=746.74s)]
*  2000 young Children from the Gaza Strip. Uh, we didn't know about that. You [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=753.5s)]
*  didn't know about that. Nobody did except for the king and his son. I [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=759.62s)]
*  assume you told your son, right? Uh, and I just thought it was great. No, I [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=763.18s)]
*  think we'll do something. I don't have to threaten with money. We do. We [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=767.9799999999999s)]
*  contribute a lot of money to Jordan and to Egypt, by the way, a lot to both, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=771.72s)]
*  but I don't have to threaten that. I don't think I think we're above that. I [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=777.4200000000001s)]
*  do believe we're above this. But you consider other countries, not Jordan [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=781.0400000000001s)]
*  and Egypt. There was talks about Indonesia, Albania, other places. Yeah, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=785.44s)]
*  sure. And we have other countries that want to get involved. We have a lot of [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=789.72s)]
*  people who want to get involved. There's a great sense of wanting to help the [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=795.0400000000001s)]
*  Palestinians. They really there's a lot of good countries out there. People [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=800.32s)]
*  that rule those countries with big hearts. And this gentleman is at the [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=804.5200000000001s)]
*  top of the list. And if they don't want to leave, how are you gonna force him? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=808.74s)]
*  Mr President? Oh, they're gonna be great. They're gonna. They're gonna be [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=812.24s)]
*  very happy. Can you? Your Majesty. Should we expect that the response [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=814.94s)]
*  would be part of a coordinated Arab response? The response will be from [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=819.72s)]
*  a multitude of countries, Arab International. I know the Europeans [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=826.4s)]
*  want to step in on again. We'll probably have to look to the help of [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=830.3199999999999s)]
*  the United States to make sure that, uh, Kogat, which is the clearing agency [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=833.84s)]
*  on the Israeli side, makes it as efficient as possible because 2000 [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=837.92s)]
*  kids. The best way to get to them is by helicopters and get them straight to [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=841.6s)]
*  our institutions. I also believe that quite a few countries would also [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=844.6s)]
*  probably like to take some of those kids and have them treated in their [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=848.3s)]
*  their hospitals. So we also want this A. S. A. P. Yes, and that's right. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=851.4s)]
*  This should have been done by the Biden administration, but you know, they [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=855.4000000000001s)]
*  didn't do anything. They didn't know what the hell they were doing. So this [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=858.48s)]
*  should have been done by the Biden administration. This should have never [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=861.12s)]
*  happened because October 7th would have never happened. If I were president, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=864.12s)]
*  zero chance of happening. You wouldn't have had that whole mess where the [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=867.96s)]
*  Middle East got blown up and you wouldn't have had Ukraine and Russia [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=872.08s)]
*  fighting. That would have never happened. And by the way, we're making [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=876.0s)]
*  good progress there. I think I really think we're making some very good [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=879.9200000000001s)]
*  progress. Mr President, you said before that the U. S. Would buy Gaza. And [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=883.28s)]
*  today you just said we're not going to buy Gaza. I'm not gonna have to buy. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=888.24s)]
*  We're gonna we're gonna have Gaza. We don't have to buy. There's nothing to [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=891.32s)]
*  buy. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=895.0s)]
*  We will have Gaza. What does that no reason to buy? There is nothing to buy. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=896.84s)]
*  It's Gaza. It's a war torn area. We're gonna take it. We're gonna hold it. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=901.36s)]
*  We're gonna cherish it. We're going to [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=906.54s)]
*  get it going eventually, where a lot of jobs are going to be created for the [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=909.2s)]
*  people in the Middle East. It's going to be for the people in the Middle East, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=914.2s)]
*  but I think it could be a diamond. It could be an absolute tremendous asset [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=917.36s)]
*  for the Middle East. And you're gonna have peace. It's gonna bring peace in [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=921.96s)]
*  the Middle East. Gaza, the way it is right now, every 10 years, you're gonna [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=925.2800000000001s)]
*  have the same thing happening. I've watched it so long. All the death and [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=929.24s)]
*  destruction of Gaza. Civilizations been wiped out in Gaza. Now it's gonna be [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=933.1600000000001s)]
*  a tremendous thing. It's, uh, it's fronting on the sea. It's gonna be a [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=939.28s)]
*  great economic development job is gonna put people to work a lot of people to [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=944.3199999999999s)]
*  work, and those people are all gonna be from the Middle East. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=947.92s)]
*  Just to follow up with one on that for King Abdullah. Can you clarify again, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=952.64s)]
*  sir? How do you feel about the U. S. Taking Gaza, as the president said? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=956.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, again, this is something that we as Arabs will be coming to the United [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=961.68s)]
*  States with something that we're going to talk about later to discuss all [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=968.14s)]
*  these options. Mr. President, take it under what authority it is sovereignty [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=971.8199999999999s)]
*  under the U. S. Authority. Mr President, did you seek to personally develop [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=975.74s)]
*  property in Gaza after this happens? No, I've had a great career in real [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=979.5s)]
*  estate. You know, when you've done what I've done in the last [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=983.6999999999999s)]
*  number of years, including the four years that we should have been doing [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=989.3s)]
*  something else frankly, because people see that now for sure. But when you've [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=993.54s)]
*  done what I've done, you could just do more good for people. When you're [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=998.66s)]
*  president, when you're president, we can do things. This is all things that [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1004.1s)]
*  should have been done, but actually things that shouldn't have had to be [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1008.16s)]
*  done. Gaza. Absolutely would have been. It would have been so great of the [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1011.32s)]
*  Biden administration would have started this. But actually, in all fairness to [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1015.98s)]
*  them, it was they should have never let it happen. It did happen. And because [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1020.22s)]
*  of the fact that they let this happen, this catastrophe of October 7th, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1026.74s)]
*  something like this becomes practical and very real, meaning the development [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1031.54s)]
*  and all of the things that I've talked about with respect to the Gaza strip. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1036.06s)]
*  If you didn't have the October 7th catastrophe and it was a horrible [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1041.46s)]
*  catastrophe, then probably you wouldn't be talking about that. But the only [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1045.74s)]
*  thing I can say is this is going to bring stability and peace to the Middle [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1051.3s)]
*  East. And ultimately, when it's developed, which will be in quite a while [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1055.22s)]
*  from now, you were just watching and hearing from President Donald Trump [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1060.46s)]
*  answering questions at the White House, along with the king of Abdullah of [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1064.66s)]
*  King rather of Jordan, his name being Abdullah. We want to bring read in here [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1069.0s)]
*  real quick, but I also want to talk about a big headline that came out of [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1072.98s)]
*  that, and that is this idea coming from King Abdullah agreeing to take in 2000 [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1076.54s)]
*  Children from Gaza, who will then live in Jordan. But a lot of questions about [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1082.3400000000001s)]
*  how this will work. He also mentioned, by the way, waiting to hear what Egypt [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1087.18s)]
*  has to bring into the table here with this plan to move Palestinians out of [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1092.22s)]
*  Gaza so the United States can take over. We'll be fascinating to see what Arab [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1097.02s)]
*  nations have to say about this, not the least of which. And you just heard that [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1100.26s)]
*  Egypt, of course, 2000 Children, which will be offered a pathway into Jordan. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1103.5s)]
*  But the question is, what about the two million Palestinians who are there? So [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1109.18s)]
*  we'll pick up the ball and run it from here. Mugo, good to be with you for now. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1114.42s)]
*  We just heard the president answer that question about what authority American [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1118.34s)]
*  has to take control of Gaza, and he answered under U. S. Authority. So let's [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1122.02s)]
*  go live to CBS News senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang. Weijia, you [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1127.7s)]
*  just listened to the same thing that I just listened into, and I just want to [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1130.9s)]
*  quote what he said for our viewers who may not have picked it up. We don't have [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1134.66s)]
*  to buy. We're going to have it. We're going to take it. Then the question was [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1138.8600000000001s)]
*  asked of the president by what authority and he said under U. S. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1143.6200000000001s)]
*  Authority. This is something we have not heard from a sitting U. S. President I [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1147.9s)]
*  can think of in recent history or ever. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1152.8600000000001s)]
*  Read. It's definitely unprecedented this entire plan to overtake Gaza and his [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1158.0600000000002s)]
*  reasoning for why he thinks he can do it, which is not true. Gaza is a sovereign [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1165.42s)]
*  territory. The U. S. Cannot just go around the world and take control of [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1171.14s)]
*  areas that it wishes to. And so the president did not explain why he thinks [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1176.26s)]
*  he can do that. He did not explain what he meant by U. S. Authority. And you read [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1184.86s)]
*  hit the nail right on the head when you were talking about what the Jordanian [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1190.4199999999998s)]
*  King offered, which was to take 2000 sick Children who have illnesses and [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1195.34s)]
*  cancer. I mean, there are two million people in Gaza, and the president wants [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1200.98s)]
*  Jordan and Egypt to take all of them while he redeveloped this as a real [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1207.3s)]
*  estate plan 2000 kids versus two million people. That's very different. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1212.66s)]
*  And the president seemed to suggest that he thinks Jordan and Egypt and other [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1218.8600000000001s)]
*  Arab nations would eventually be on board with taking all two million. But [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1223.22s)]
*  the king was very careful and very strategic in his words and saying that we [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1227.78s)]
*  have to consult with our counterparts. We have to have a broader meeting. But [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1233.22s)]
*  keep in mind, read, you know, Jordan, along with those other countries, have [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1239.1399999999999s)]
*  already issued a statement to say they support a two state Palestinian [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1243.22s)]
*  solution. They do not believe that the Palestinians should be displaced, and [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1248.1s)]
*  they will not take those Palestinians in the meantime. And so this is a really [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1253.4199999999998s)]
*  awkward conversation that we just saw play out here. And it's notable read [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1259.58s)]
*  that yesterday the president said that he would consider withholding U. S. Aid [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1264.98s)]
*  from Jordan and other countries who do not comply essentially with what he [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1270.28s)]
*  wants, which is for them to take the displaced Palestinians. Today he [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1274.94s)]
*  changed his tune because he was sitting right next to the king. And he said, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1278.98s)]
*  Well, I don't think we'll get there. I don't think we have to. We're already [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1282.82s)]
*  making good progress. So, you know, this is a very careful conversation that [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1285.5s)]
*  they're having in public, but I'm very curious to learn more about what they [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1291.18s)]
*  talk about in private read. Right. And it seemed when you listen to the king [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1296.22s)]
*  right there that he wanted Egypt to have more to say here. But, you know, you [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1300.9s)]
*  bring the dollars and cents conversation in President Donald Trump was heard [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1305.54s)]
*  there saying the U. S. Gives a lot of money to Egypt as well. Is that we do [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1309.38s)]
*  what we're really talking about here? You know, the president says we're above [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1313.9s)]
*  we don't have to make a threat, but the threat is there in the air that dollars [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1317.3400000000001s)]
*  could be pulled from Jordan dollars could be pulled from Egypt. Is that [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1321.6200000000001s)]
*  really what it's going to come down to when he says under U. S. Authority, is [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1325.22s)]
*  he really meaning under U. S. Threat of pulling dollars? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1329.14s)]
*  Well, I think, you know, if you just listen to what the president said [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1334.3400000000001s)]
*  yesterday, read, yes, that is at the heart of it, because even though these [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1338.22s)]
*  countries have repeatedly and publicly said they will not take these displaced [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1342.3799999999999s)]
*  Palestinians from Gaza, President Trump has also said time and time again that [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1347.8999999999999s)]
*  he thinks they'll change their minds. So you have to wonder what political [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1352.6599999999999s)]
*  levers he has. Well, I can tell you that in 2022, the State Department agreed to [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1356.4199999999998s)]
*  a new deal with Jordan to supply $1.45 billion in aid a year. And we did just [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1361.82s)]
*  hear the king say that he has to do what's best for his country without [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1369.3799999999999s)]
*  committing to anything beyond that 2000 Children. But certainly this is an [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1373.98s)]
*  important calculation, and it gives President Trump leverage. Now, even if [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1379.54s)]
*  he found a place for two million Palestinians to go, there still remains [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1385.6599999999999s)]
*  so many questions read about his vision for rebuilding. And I think the central [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1390.6999999999998s)]
*  question today is how are you going to end the war first before we even start [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1396.3s)]
*  talking about rebuilding? We know that the ceasefire deal is extremely fragile, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1401.7s)]
*  especially since President Trump set a new deadline yesterday and saying that [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1407.66s)]
*  if all the hostages are not released by Saturday, then quote all hell will break [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1412.02s)]
*  loose. Read. Well, and also news broke while we were inside of this experience [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1418.3s)]
*  watching outside of the White House to see what was going on behind closed [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1423.78s)]
*  doors between the king of Jordan and President Donald Trump. Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1426.98s)]
*  seemed to echo almost word for word what President Donald Trump said by way of [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1431.38s)]
*  that Saturday deadline. We have to remind our viewers we are in phase one [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1436.34s)]
*  of what is likely or at least thought initially to be a two phase ceasefire [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1440.5s)]
*  and hostage release deal. Now Hamas has paused. They paused in their release [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1445.14s)]
*  because they say Israel is going back on some of their promises. But how can [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1451.06s)]
*  this be seen if we're threatening a deadline on Saturday that all hell [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1455.3s)]
*  will break loose? How can this not be seen as Israel and United States also [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1458.74s)]
*  ripping up their side of the deal today? Not Saturday, but today. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1463.62s)]
*  Yeah, well, and this was the Biden administration's worst nightmare as it [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1467.94s)]
*  related to the ceasefire deal that they spent so many months of brokering read. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1472.94s)]
*  And you're right that there were two phases when it came to releasing all the [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1478.78s)]
*  hostages and ending the war permanently. The third phase was supposed to be [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1482.46s)]
*  rebuilding Gaza. And there were a lot of concerns about whether the Trump [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1488.14s)]
*  administration would be able to successfully implement the ceasefire [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1493.66s)]
*  deal. Now you may remember when all parties signed it. There was praise from [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1498.78s)]
*  President Trump. He said it was an epic deal. He said it never would have crossed [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1504.82s)]
*  over the finish line if not for his victory in November, if not for his [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1509.26s)]
*  Middle East envoy, Steve Wittkopf, who did play an instrumental role in sealing [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1514.7s)]
*  the deal. And there was high praise for the agreement. Well, I think it was [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1521.06s)]
*  really telling Reed that when Prime Minister Netanyahu visited the White [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1525.5s)]
*  House about a week ago, at that time, Steve Wittkopf said, you know, he was [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1529.66s)]
*  asked, what if Israel just says, we're not going to end the war? What about [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1534.46s)]
*  that? And what was a really revealing bit of information was Wittkopf said, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1538.5800000000002s)]
*  well, look, the problem is we signed a deal. They signed a deal that was not so [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1543.7s)]
*  wonderful. You know, the Trump administration had nothing to do with [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1547.66s)]
*  that deal. We did not dictate the terms. And so they were already backing off [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1551.18s)]
*  from this praise of the ceasefire agreement. I think opening a door [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1556.1399999999999s)]
*  realizing that it might fall apart. And here we are today, Reed, to your point, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1561.58s)]
*  it seems as though they are ready to start over, renegotiate, end the deal, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1567.02s)]
*  whatever you want to call it, remains to be seen unless the hostages are all [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1572.1399999999999s)]
*  released, which, as you mentioned, Hamas has already said, is not going to happen. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1577.74s)]
*  And so this, like I mentioned, is exactly why the Biden administration was so [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1581.74s)]
*  fearful that even though they were able to get it done, it wasn't going to be up [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1586.7s)]
*  to them to carry it out. And now we are seeing a very different turn of events, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1592.54s)]
*  Reed, and we don't know what the future will be for Gaza. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1599.1000000000001s)]
*  Weijia Jiang, so much to keep track of and literally history writing itself in [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1603.26s)]
*  real time. Thank you so much for that live report from the White House. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1608.78s)]
*  Invaluable. All right. When we come back, of course, we just looked at the [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1612.06s)]
*  executive branch. But what about the legislative branch? There is reaction on [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1616.7s)]
*  Capitol Hill to what you just heard there in the White House from President [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1620.3799999999999s)]

*  Here. Welcome back to CBS News 24 seven. So we are watching this very closely as [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1639.1s)]
*  we speak. President Donald Trump is meeting with the King of Jordan. Trump [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1643.82s)]
*  and King Abdullah answered a lot of questions from reporters. Let's go live [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1647.5s)]
*  to CBS News. Nicole Killian, because Nicole is going to be talking to lawmakers [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1652.3s)]
*  today about a headline that I think is jaw dropping for so many people. Nicole, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1656.86s)]
*  I just want to recap for our viewers who may be tuning in. Donald Trump was asked [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1660.7s)]
*  relative to how will the U. S. Have the Gaza Strip? He says we don't have to buy. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1665.74s)]
*  We're going to have it. Take it. He was asked the question by what authority he [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1671.02s)]
*  said under U. S. Authority. You talk to members of Congress all the time who [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1675.26s)]
*  control the purse strings. What questions do you anticipate you will hear from [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1680.14s)]
*  members of Congress today? Given that headline? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1683.8200000000002s)]
*  Well, I'm sure many lawmakers are going to be asked to react to those comments. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1688.46s)]
*  What we can say is that even when the president last week made those comments [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1692.54s)]
*  suggesting that the U. S. Take over Gaza, it was met with some pushback here on [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1698.46s)]
*  Capitol Hill, not just from Democrats, but also from Republicans, including a [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1703.8999999999999s)]
*  top ally of the president, Lindsey Graham, who said the idea of trying to put U. S. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1708.22s)]
*  Boots on the ground would just be problematic that this is a nonstarter for [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1713.58s)]
*  many senators. So that sentiment is likely what we may encounter from some [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1718.62s)]
*  lawmakers. Although on the flip side, you have people like Speaker Mike Johnson, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1725.26s)]
*  who said that he felt that this was a good development, that this would be a [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1729.26s)]
*  bold and decisive move. However, when I pressed him last week on whether or not [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1733.1s)]
*  yes or no, he thinks the U. S. Should take over Gaza. He wouldn't answer that [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1738.22s)]
*  question directly and just said that further discussion was warranted. So [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1741.74s)]
*  again, I think we may see lawmakers try to put some distance between those [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1746.38s)]
*  comments, but I think many lawmakers may certainly welcome this move to at least [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1750.8600000000001s)]
*  move some of those sick Children, which was also part of that announcement. Sick [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1755.8200000000002s)]
*  Children in Gaza, some 2000 into Jordan and worth noting that the king of Jordan [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1759.98s)]
*  is expected to be up here on Capitol Hill later today, where it's possible he [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1765.5800000000002s)]
*  too could face more questions about his exchanges with the president there at [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1770.46s)]
*  the White House. All right, so we also know that there is that deadline that's [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1774.78s)]
*  given of Saturday or all hell will break loose in Gaza relative to the hostage [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1779.18s)]
*  release deal. The president saying he's done with the drip, drip, drip of [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1784.86s)]
*  hostages to use his words and his terminology. Any reaction from lawmakers [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1787.98s)]
*  about that hard deadline, which now seems to be echoed by Prime Minister [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1792.3799999999999s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu in recent hours? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1796.62s)]
*  Well, I think there's certainly a bit of concern. What we can tell you is that [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1798.38s)]
*  the president's Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff was also here on Capitol Hill [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1805.18s)]
*  just last week briefing lawmakers, and that was not long after again, the [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1810.7s)]
*  president made those comments about a potential U. S. Takeover of Gaza. You [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1815.8200000000002s)]
*  know, senators at the time said a lot of that meeting was really aimed at kind of [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1819.42s)]
*  discussing the administration's posture about the Middle East, though not [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1824.6200000000001s)]
*  specifically designed to kind of explain the president's comments, if you will. So [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1829.98s)]
*  again, this is something that certainly could raise questions for many lawmakers. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1835.8200000000002s)]
*  I think for the most part that they do want to make sure that that ceasefire [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1839.74s)]
*  deal is adhered to particularly many Democrats, allies of President Biden, for [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1843.66s)]
*  instance, who was integral in helping to negotiate that ceasefire. I mean, by and [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1848.22s)]
*  large, most lawmakers want to see peace in the region, but how that is [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1853.34s)]
*  accomplished again continues to remain to be seen before the headline that [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1857.82s)]
*  happened just a moment ago at the White House between the king of Jordan and [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1863.5s)]
*  President Donald Trump Democrats were talking about Elon Musk having some [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1867.1s)]
*  access to the Department of Education records. What did Democrats have to say [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1871.82s)]
*  about that before this other big headline broke? Yeah, well, I think just [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1875.98s)]
*  to be clear, I know the president has said that he would like for Elon Musk to [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1881.18s)]
*  review the Department of Education, review the Pentagon, as we know that is [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1885.8200000000002s)]
*  this Doge team is reviewing other federal agencies. What we can tell you is [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1891.18s)]
*  that House Democrats, Congressional Democrats, by and large, are trying to [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1897.26s)]
*  draw more attention to this issue or potential possibility of eliminating the [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1902.3s)]
*  Department of Education. That is something that the president has talked [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1908.22s)]
*  about. We have had some reporting that he may be working on a potential [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1911.0200000000002s)]
*  executive order, but even if he puts forth an executive order at some point, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1914.5400000000002s)]
*  it still requires an act of Congress to actually abolish the department. And [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1918.7800000000002s)]
*  certainly this is an issue that is gaining a lot of traction, particularly [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1924.6200000000001s)]
*  this week, because the president nominee for Secretary of Education Linda McMahon [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1928.7s)]
*  is going to be here on Capitol Hill on Thursday for her confirmation hearing [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1934.22s)]
*  where this issue is likely to be a big part of that hearing. So there are some [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1939.5800000000002s)]
*  members of Congress, Republican members of Congress, who have introduced [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1945.0200000000002s)]
*  legislation to abolish the department, but beyond that, it hasn't really [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1948.3000000000002s)]
*  advanced. Nicole Killian, live from Capitol Hill, and once again, a tall [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1953.5s)]
*  order of subjects to talk about. We appreciate the opportunity to stream [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1958.38s)]
*  with you today on CBS News 24 seven. Have a good day, my friend. All right. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1961.42s)]
*  When we come back, boys, boys, boys, Elon Musk, Sam Altman, a couple of AI [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1965.26s)]
*  titans in the tech world. They're trading barbs again, what they had to say [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1970.94s)]
*  and where they had to say it. When we come back. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1976.78s)]
*  Welcome back, everybody. So let's talk about those high level lawmaker [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1991.8200000000002s)]
*  questions affecting all of our bottom lines. New policies from the Trump [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1994.54s)]
*  administration playing big in Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's twice [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=1998.22s)]
*  yearly testimony to members of Congress. So listen to senators pressing Powell [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2001.9s)]
*  over Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, gaining [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2005.98s)]
*  access to a payment system within the Treasury Department. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2010.54s)]
*  Is the system safe today? I believe it is. And I will tell you, we are very [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2014.78s)]
*  strongly committed to the integrity, efficacy, resilience and all those [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2020.14s)]
*  things of this system. And, you know, people do depend on this in a big way. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2023.5800000000002s)]
*  And we're committed to that. An unelected billionaire and his [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2028.14s)]
*  hacksters, dangerous attempts to access Americans, private data and the Treasury [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2031.66s)]
*  Department systems that control $6 trillion in annual payments to millions [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2036.7800000000002s)]
*  of American citizens, including Social Security, Medicare and tax refunds. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2041.9s)]
*  Quickly, yes or no. Has Elon Musk or members of his team, to your knowledge, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2046.06s)]
*  attempted to access the Fed's protected data and systems? [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2053.1s)]
*  Yes or no? I don't believe so. I don't believe so. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2060.2999999999997s)]
*  CBS News business correspondent Javier David joins us now. Javier, that did not [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2063.82s)]
*  sound like a definite yes or no. He said, I don't believe so. How do you read that? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2067.98s)]
*  I think at the core of this whole debate is really one, a simple sort of thing [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2073.58s)]
*  about betting. Like you have given access to, or these folks have had access to [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2078.62s)]
*  very sensitive systems. You don't necessarily hand over your checkbook or your access to your bank [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2084.8599999999997s)]
*  account to just anybody. There's a lot of questions about who these guys are, what [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2089.66s)]
*  sign of power they have, the access. And everyone has been qualified. So, and there's already [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2094.54s)]
*  reports emerging that some people have had negative things in their background. You know, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2100.78s)]
*  you're operating at the highest levels of government. You're dealing with trillions of [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2105.5s)]
*  dollars. And there's a whole question about whether or not they're trustworthy or capable. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2108.7000000000003s)]
*  And I think that that's what's driving this conversation really right now. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2113.6600000000003s)]
*  Well, and when an elected official asked the Fed chair himself, has Elon Musk access, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2116.7000000000003s)]
*  and the Fed chair says, I don't think so. That raises a whole lot of questions. Who is watching [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2121.02s)]
*  Elon Musk? Who's watching Elon Musk's people that he is actually working with here? What's the checks [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2127.42s)]
*  and balances on, as the lawmaker put, an unelected official? Indeed. I mean, I think that, you know, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2132.54s)]
*  we talk a lot about trust in government, transparency, but there's not a lot of [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2140.06s)]
*  transparency. And I don't have to tell you that Elon Musk is a very polarizing figure. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2144.86s)]
*  And he's a very wealthy guy and a very influential guy. So is he doing something that [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2150.94s)]
*  I think the question is, is he working on behalf of the government or working on behalf of the [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2156.7799999999997s)]
*  public? Or is he doing something that really just ultimately will benefit himself? And those are [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2161.42s)]
*  questions that are really unanswered and they're percolating, not just amongst sort of allies or [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2166.46s)]
*  enemies of the Trump, but even some within the GOP have made this observation as well. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2171.66s)]
*  Okay, so let's talk more tech. Of course, Sam Altman making headlines today after [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2176.14s)]
*  Musk led investor group tried to buy OpenAI, of course, chat DPT fame. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2180.7s)]
*  Kind of fascinating to see this here. Altman firing back after Musk's group submitted an [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2186.22s)]
*  unsolicited $97.4 billion bid to take over OpenAI. We just wanted to play that. We'll [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2191.3399999999997s)]
*  talk about it on the other side. Let's listen. Sam, should you have taken Elon's offer? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2197.1s)]
*  You refused $1 billion for Elon Musk. What do you want to say to Elon Musk? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2203.1s)]
*  Received what from him? What? Almost $100 billion, right? [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2206.7799999999997s)]
*  The company is not for sale. Neither submission. We're happy to buy Twitter if you can talk about [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2210.3s)]
*  that. Yeah. Oh, well, Altman reiterated that message in a post on Elon Musk's ex saying he'll [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2213.82s)]
*  buy Twitter for just $9.74 billion. Noticing he moved that decimal point there. So what does [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2219.6600000000003s)]
*  this fight between these two tech billionaires mean for the future of AI? Because we know [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2226.46s)]
*  the vice president of the United States is overseas. He did not sign an agreement with [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2230.6200000000003s)]
*  other nations to try to put regulations on AI. We know of hundreds of billions of dollars pledged [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2235.66s)]
*  to build AI in these United States. How do we read all of this? Well, the only thing you really [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2240.8599999999997s)]
*  need to know about the story is Elon Musk, Sam Altman really don't like each other. They never [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2245.58s)]
*  have. They probably never will. The saga has been decade or so in the making. The difference now was [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2249.98s)]
*  here. Look, Musk has a lot of support, including the ear of a U.S. president. He's got a lot of [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2255.18s)]
*  access to a lot of capital and he's making a play for what is effectively a nonprofit. And this, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2260.14s)]
*  again, goes back years, but he was once part of that. But he's a very influential guy and both of [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2264.86s)]
*  them are going to have a lot to say about this AI arms race. The strange thing here, of course, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2270.38s)]
*  is that President Trump has tapped Altman's in this push to bolster the $500 billion Stargate [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2274.1400000000003s)]
*  federal AI initiative. It's really important that we kind of compete with China and other players [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2279.98s)]
*  abroad, but Musk kind of continues to troll his nemesis in a way that's very public and it's [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2284.86s)]
*  taking the spotlight away from what is really a very important, pivotal public-private partnership. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2292.22s)]
*  Well, and Elon Musk has famously said he wishes he had not been a part of helping Sam Altman get [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2297.3399999999997s)]
*  his start for OpenAI. Fascinating to watch there. Let's put that aside because there's obviously so [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2302.06s)]
*  much that we could talk about about those two dueling guys. We've got to ask you about the egg [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2308.22s)]
*  shortage. Now Costco trader Joe's limiting how many eggs that shoppers can buy. So boil it down for [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2312.62s)]
*  if you will. Will breakfast lovers get any relief anytime sooner? We're just going to have to see a [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2319.4199999999996s)]
*  whole new season come up. The short answer is no. And sadly, the economics 101, well, maybe it's [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2323.8199999999997s)]
*  economics 102, tells you that basically when you have a shortage of something and too many people [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2330.22s)]
*  want it, at least a couple of things have to happen. Prices will go up. That's number one. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2334.7799999999997s)]
*  And or the entity selling them will need to ration them in order to make sure that everyone can get [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2339.2599999999998s)]
*  their fair share and avoid stockpiling. So that's what's happening with Costco and trader Joe's. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2343.8199999999997s)]
*  It's unfolding across stores across the country. Part of it is the bird flu. A big part of it is [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2348.78s)]
*  bird flu, actually. But it's the headlines sort of helped to drive this panic buying. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2353.5s)]
*  Unfortunately, it has the opposite of the intended effect. So people see this and they're like, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2359.34s)]
*  I better go get my eggs. And sure enough, there's not enough. So it's creating this, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2363.9s)]
*  what I call the existential crisis. It's, you know, sporadic shortages of them stores, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2369.02s)]
*  a lot of stores just struggling to keep them in stock and prices just keep going up. And [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2373.6600000000003s)]
*  unfortunately, again, there's no end in sight. Okay. Well, cancel boiled eggs from my breakfast [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2377.9s)]
*  tomorrow. Thank you so much, Javier David. It's always great to talk to you. All right. So we [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2383.7400000000002s)]
*  are continuing to follow breaking news regarding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2388.78s)]
*  says that fighting will resume in the Gaza Strip unless Hamas releases its hostage. They've given [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2393.1800000000003s)]
*  a deadline of Saturday. Hamas said that they cut off the release of three more hostages on Saturday [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2398.46s)]
*  because Israel they say violated their ceasefire agreement. So think about this. Let's do some [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2405.34s)]
*  timing here. That news broke while this meeting was about to happen. President Donald Trump [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2410.3s)]
*  meeting with the King of Jordan, King Abdullah there. Mr. Trump continued to talk about his [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2416.46s)]
*  pressure on Arab nations to take in Palestinians as part of what he has promised of taking over [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2420.86s)]
*  Gaza. Let's listen in. We will have Gaza. What is that? No reason to buy. There is nothing to buy. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2426.78s)]
*  It's Gaza. It's a war torn area. We're going to take it. We're going to hold it. We're going to [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2433.66s)]
*  cherish it. We're going to get it going eventually where a lot of jobs are going to be created for [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2439.3399999999997s)]
*  the people in the Middle East. It's going to be for the people in the Middle East, but I think [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2446.46s)]
*  it could be a diamond. It could be an absolute tremendous asset for the Middle East. And you're [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2450.14s)]
*  going to have peace. It's going to bring peace in the Middle East. So let's bring in CBS News [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2456.06s)]
*  Middle East reporter Courtney Keely. Welcome Courtney. Okay. So he was asked by what authority [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2460.38s)]
*  he said by U.S. authority, but we have to keep in mind what about the will of the Palestinian people, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2465.5s)]
*  two million Palestinian people. Absolutely. This is called the rate of return. And this has been [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2471.26s)]
*  something that's been ongoing and in the Geneva peace conventions of 1948, also in the UN. This [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2478.3s)]
*  has also been something that they've never gotten to in final status talks after Oslo [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2484.7000000000003s)]
*  basically crumbled in 2000 during the second Intifada. But it's one of the main pillars of [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2489.42s)]
*  peace. Now Palestinians, there are refugees in Lebanon that they've been through multi-generations [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2495.34s)]
*  in different wars, same as Syria. And there's 60% of the Jordanian population is Palestinian. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2500.7000000000003s)]
*  The Palestinian problem has bedeviled the region for all this time. And many say, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2508.14s)]
*  unless this problem gets solved, there will be no prosperity or peace anywhere in the Middle East. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2514.62s)]
*  So it's the crux of everything. And the last time President Trump was president his first term, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2520.38s)]
*  he did go through with that Abraham Accords, which left the Palestinians out of the equation. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2526.14s)]
*  Now with the Gaza war, now with this tenuous ceasefire with President Trump saying that U.S. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2530.94s)]
*  will hold this, cherish this land and the Palestinians will be given land elsewhere. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2536.54s)]
*  That's really a non-starter for any of the Arab states. And King Abdullah at this meeting that [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2541.26s)]
*  we just saw them sitting in the Oval Office talking ahead of their longer discussion, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2545.5800000000004s)]
*  tried to put this as diplomatically as possible, saying that they have a great relationship, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2551.0200000000004s)]
*  avoiding that third rail of politics, that discussion really of Palestinians, but [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2556.94s)]
*  just basically saying and referring to that there's going to be an emergency Arab summit [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2564.1400000000003s)]
*  on February 27th. So this is all on the table. This is not going to be something that the Arab [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2569.3399999999997s)]
*  countries will allow or that they will take these Palestinians in. Well, and you know, if you did a [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2575.4199999999996s)]
*  word count between what President Donald Trump said and what the King of Jordan, Mr. Abdullah, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2581.58s)]
*  had to say, you would see that the lion's share of the talking was done by President Donald Trump. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2586.62s)]
*  When the King of Jordan was asked about this, he had one word that he kept saying over and over, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2591.58s)]
*  and that is Egypt. How does Egypt factor into this? [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2596.22s)]
*  Well, Egypt and Jordan both have their peace deals with Israel, and they've been critical partners [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2601.4199999999996s)]
*  and protectors of the state of Israel while other countries have been at war. And the Iran [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2606.9399999999996s)]
*  nexus, you had the Hamas and Hezbollah nexus and the Iranians and the Shia crescent. So with the [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2613.58s)]
*  Egyptian Camp David Accords that established peace during President Carter, with the peace that was [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2620.54s)]
*  established between Jordan and Israel 30 years ago, and Jordan and Egypt get a lot of money [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2626.86s)]
*  and assistance from the U.S. to keep the peace, really, and also keep regional stability. So you [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2633.5800000000004s)]
*  have intelligence sharing with these leaders, the general, as President Trump referred to him the [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2639.82s)]
*  other day, General Sisi of Egypt and King Abdullah of Jordan. They also want to keep their countries [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2644.86s)]
*  from spilling over into any kind of extremist conflict themselves. So it's not just money for [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2651.1s)]
*  aid and military assistance. It's keeping their countries secure and keeping any spillover [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2656.86s)]
*  extremism from toppling their presidency or their kingdom and also being aligned with Israel. So all [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2663.58s)]
*  of this is fragile and tenuous, but it's something that the U.S. has also said they haven't cut aid to [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2672.46s)]
*  Jordan and Egypt. President Trump is not threatening to cut aid. For instance, Jordan gets $1.6 billion [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2678.14s)]
*  in aid, approximately. Egypt gets something similar. And it's a lot of, like I said, intelligence [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2685.26s)]
*  sharing. It's not just keeping the peace and stability. It's also a relationship that's critical [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2692.2200000000003s)]
*  in terms of national security for all three countries. Well, and now the news that broke [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2699.26s)]
*  during that meeting between the king and the president, Benjamin Netanyahu really reinforcing [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2705.0200000000004s)]
*  what President Donald Trump said, that if all hostages are not released by Saturday, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2709.26s)]
*  all hell will break loose. So you talk about tenuous. You talk about fragile [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2714.1400000000003s)]
*  on many fronts there. Courtney and Keely, thank you so much for those thoughts. Well, when we come back, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2718.7000000000003s)]
*  we have a bit of breaking news. It was just handed to me. Russia has released a detained American [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2724.62s)]
*  teacher, Mark Fogel. That news also breaking at this hour. We'll have details on that when we come [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2729.3399999999997s)]
*  back on CBS News 24 7. When we see it, you see it. We have breaking news to deliver on the promise [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2734.46s)]
*  of this broadcast here on CBS News 24 7. This comes from the White House. Russia has just released [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2745.8199999999997s)]
*  detained American teacher Mark Fogel. That is news out of the White House. So we have an idea of [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2751.02s)]
*  exactly how this played out. And it's interesting because it speaks to what is happening relative [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2756.62s)]
*  to talks with Russia, talks with Ukraine and some potential deal making here. So just want to get [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2761.02s)]
*  into this. Steve Witkoff, who was a special envoy by President Donald Trump, just left Russian air [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2766.22s)]
*  space with Mr. Fogel. Mr. Fogel, keep in mind, was arrested in August of 2021. He was serving a 14 [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2772.3s)]
*  year prison sentence in the Russian prison system. His family and supporters say he was traveling with [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2778.62s)]
*  medically prescribed marijuana. So Mike Walls did not say how the deal played out because it was a [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2783.9s)]
*  deal that was made. Apparently Russia and the U.S. negotiated an exchange to ensure Fogel's release. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2790.8599999999997s)]
*  Here's what we don't know. What that exchange meant, what the U.S. side bargained, what the [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2797.98s)]
*  Russians bargained here. But we do know the previous work of exchanges really didn't do [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2802.62s)]
*  anything. But Mr. Walls, and this is interesting and fundamental to our current time as we speak [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2808.8599999999997s)]
*  to the war between Russia and Ukraine, he said that this development with the release of American [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2814.46s)]
*  teacher Mark Fogel is, and these are his words, a sign that we are moving in the right direction [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2819.8199999999997s)]
*  to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine. Pretty fascinating here. Now you are seeing Mr. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2824.7s)]
*  Fogel's family there. They released a statement saying this has been the darkest and most painful [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2830.06s)]
*  period of our lives, but today we begin to heal. So once again, American teacher Mark Fogel has [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2834.62s)]
*  been released. He just left Russian airspace with Mr. Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2840.7s)]
*  Pretty fascinating times we are in right now and so more breaking news, a hostage release to talk [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2847.02s)]
*  about. What will this say relative to Russia's war in Ukraine? Mr. Witkoff says it seems to mean [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2852.22s)]
*  there is a little bit of softening where a deal is concerned. We will be watching that closely. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2858.7s)]
*  All right. So let's talk about another headline. Meantime, President Donald Trump's mass [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2864.54s)]
*  deportation effort getting some backlash from none other than Pope Francis. In response, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2868.3799999999997s)]
*  Trump's border czar Tom Homan is telling the Pope to stick to the Catholic Church. Those are Mr. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2874.7799999999997s)]
*  Homan's words. Let's turn now to CBS News immigration and politics reporter Camilo Montoya Galvez. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2880.7s)]
*  What is the back and forth there? It is not often that we hear a head of government telling the Pope [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2886.2999999999997s)]
*  to stick to his job in the Catholic Church. Well, read, Pope Francis has long been an outspoken [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2892.06s)]
*  and vocal advocate on behalf of migrants and refugees and this week he penned a letter [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2899.2599999999998s)]
*  in which he essentially criticized the Trump administration's immigration policies. He said [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2904.06s)]
*  in that letter read that all countries have the right, the legal right to defend their territory [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2909.18s)]
*  from criminals and others who may endanger the public safety and national security of people [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2914.3s)]
*  within that country, but he also denounced the deportation of migrants and refugees for fleeing [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2920.3s)]
*  persecution and poverty, saying that that undermines the dignity of human beings. And so [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2925.42s)]
*  obviously borders czar Tom Homan took issue with that statement by the Pope saying that the Vatican, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2930.54s)]
*  for example, has a fence around that perimeter in that part of Rome. And obviously he's saying that [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oksj3HhAo&t=2935.5800000000004s)]
