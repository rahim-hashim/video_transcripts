# Breaking down the unconditional discharge sentence for Trump
**CBS News:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4)
*  If you're just joining us, Judge Juan Marchand has ruled an unconditional discharge in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=0.0s)]
*  New York Cush Money criminal trial of president-elect Donald Trump. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=4.64s)]
*  I want to bring in Jessica Levinson for more on this. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=9.0s)]
*  She's a CBS News legal contributor and a professor at Loyola Law School. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=11.6s)]
*  So, Jessica, the judge said it is the legal protections afforded to the office of the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=15.92s)]
*  president that are extraordinary, not the occupant of the office. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=20.68s)]
*  Your take on what we just saw in New York City. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=23.96s)]
*  I think what we just saw is a judge acknowledging reality that he is not facing any criminal [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=28.88s)]
*  defendant or convicted criminal. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=34.68s)]
*  In fact, he is facing the former and more importantly, future president of the United [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=36.6s)]
*  States. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=42.16s)]
*  And, Vlad, as we've been talking about, that is a person who, by virtue of the office that [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=43.16s)]
*  they inhabit, not by virtue of who they are, but by virtue of their job, they enjoy protections. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=48.76s)]
*  They enjoy protections from being sued civilly for official conduct. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=55.7s)]
*  They enjoy protections from criminal liability for criminal, excuse me, criminal liability [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=61.22s)]
*  for official conduct. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=67.74s)]
*  And what we're seeing here is, of course, that extends to any real potential sentence [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=69.54s)]
*  that the judge is not going to say, I will be the person who puts strings and restrictions [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=74.53999999999999s)]
*  on the occupant of the Oval Office. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=82.3s)]
*  Again, because of how our Constitution is structured, because of all of that case law [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=85.10000000000001s)]
*  indicating that we need to protect the office of the presidency. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=88.9s)]
*  So, Jessica, stand by. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=93.22s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News Senior White House correspondent, Weijia Jiang. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=95.38s)]
*  She's in West Palm Beach. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=99.06s)]
*  I know this just happened, Weijia, but are you hearing any indication that we will expect [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=100.86s)]
*  to hear from the president-elect today on what just transpired in a New York City courtroom? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=107.42s)]
*  Well, you're right that it just wrapped up and we did hear from Trump inside that proceeding. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=113.22s)]
*  As for whether he'll make remarks today, you know, you just never know when you're talking [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=119.17999999999999s)]
*  about Trump and he could very well feel like adding more to what he said inside the courtroom [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=123.53999999999999s)]
*  because we know this has been hanging over him. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=130.38s)]
*  In fact, he made remarks about it last night trying to downplay the sentencing, saying [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=132.57999999999998s)]
*  that he actually agreed with the Supreme Court's decision not to block the sentencing because [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=138.42s)]
*  he says the justices mentioned that he could appeal, which is exactly what he plans to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=145.74s)]
*  do. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=151.1s)]
*  But he also said that, you know, he's going to go and do his quote, little thing today, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=152.1s)]
*  meaning show up during the proceeding and that his political opponent, Marshawn in this [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=157.46s)]
*  case, the judge, would be able to have quote, fun with him. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=164.14s)]
*  And so he tried to brush it off in his words, Vlad, but his actions, of course, spoke much [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=167.98s)]
*  louder because he did try to stop the sentencing from happening because even though he doesn't [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=173.89999999999998s)]
*  have to pay a penalty, this does now solidify him as a convicted felon. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=179.62s)]
*  This will now be part of his criminal record forever. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=186.06s)]
*  And so when he talked about appealing, he said he would do it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=189.78s)]
*  And he said that even though he doesn't have to pay any consequences or penalties, he's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=192.66s)]
*  doing it, quote, psychologically, Vlad. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=196.73999999999998s)]
*  So it's really interesting that he spoke about this last night and used that word to describe [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=199.45999999999998s)]
*  why he is going to contest this, because he knows in his mind that he is a convict. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=204.94s)]
*  And so as to answer your original question, I wouldn't be surprised at all if we did hear [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=212.57999999999998s)]
*  more from President-elect Trump today here in West Palm Beach. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=218.66s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=223.94s)]
*  Weijia Jiang for us reporting from West Palm Beach. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=224.94s)]
*  Thank you, Weijia, as always. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=227.62s)]
*  We appreciate you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=228.62s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News political reporter and attorney Katrina Kaufman, who's joining [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=229.62s)]
*  me now from outside that courthouse in New York City. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=233.18s)]
*  You were sitting in the courtroom, Katrina. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=235.26000000000002s)]
*  Give us some color. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=237.26000000000002s)]
*  What did you see? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=238.26000000000002s)]
*  What did you hear? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=239.26000000000002s)]
*  Hi, Vlad. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=240.26000000000002s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=241.26000000000002s)]
*  It was a very different atmosphere in that courtroom today. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=243.42000000000002s)]
*  You could almost feel how much more relaxed it was without the anticipation of Trump's [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=246.62s)]
*  arrival. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=251.58s)]
*  But there were still all of the courtroom reporters there, the sketch artists. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=252.98000000000002s)]
*  There was the usual photography spray, but this time they were shooting the screen with [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=256.82s)]
*  Trump and his attorney Todd Blanch on it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=261.06s)]
*  As you can see in that photo, they were sitting with American flags behind them. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  And Trump was only seemed semi-interested during all this. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=268.66s)]
*  He was looking down quite a bit, but then really harked up when he heard the prosecution [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=272.62s)]
*  talking about the charges against him. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=278.18s)]
*  And there really just was a gravity, though, to hearing Justice Mershon proclaim the sentence [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=282.18s)]
*  and also really imply that he would have wanted to impose a harsher sentence on Donald Trump [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=288.18s)]
*  if it wasn't for the strictures of the presidency, the office that Mershon said Trump is about [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=295.34s)]
*  to occupy. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=301.82s)]
*  But he really emphasized that what's extraordinary is the protections that are afforded that [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=303.14s)]
*  office, not the occupant, he said. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=308.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=312.3s)]
*  And so the question, of course, going forward is just sort of what this will mean larger, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=313.3s)]
*  bigger picture, Katrina, as an attorney, the idea that a president of the United States [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=320.7s)]
*  is now also a convicted felon. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=325.7s)]
*  I know that we've normalized the president-elect over the course of the last eight years, but [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=327.78s)]
*  this is really extraordinary. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=332.98s)]
*  And we often use the word unprecedented, but this is unprecedented. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=335.14s)]
*  I mean, it really is, Vlad, in every way. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=342.3s)]
*  And what's extraordinary is that there are many jobs and things that a convicted felon [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=345.02s)]
*  cannot do in the United States, but we now have one who is going to be leading our country. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=350.42s)]
*  Even though a jury verdict had come in from this trial with these 34 counts finding Trump [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=357.26s)]
*  guilty, the American people still decided to elect him president. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=362.98s)]
*  And what this sentencing does is it's really a note of finality, branding him as a convicted [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=368.02s)]
*  felon just 10 days before inauguration. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=373.74s)]
*  All right, Katrina Kaufman, we appreciate you as always, my friend. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=380.9s)]
*  Jessica Levinson, Weijia Jiang, all of you who've been contributing to our coverage [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=384.98s)]
*  of this extraordinary day in a New York City courtroom, thank you all very much. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=389.98s)]
*  I want to let our viewers know that we're also going to be getting audio from the courtroom [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=394.34s)]
*  soon and we're going to bring that to you as soon as it comes in. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=398.58s)]
*  Meanwhile, some other news to get to, including the stories that we've been following all [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDchME2SH4&t=402.38s)]
