# Arab-Americans who voted for Trump react to Gaza takeover plan
**CBS News:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA)
*  President Trump's plan to take over Gaza is causing mixed emotions, you might say, for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=0.0s)]
*  some of the Arab Americans who voted for him. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=5.08s)]
*  Now, some of those voters are in Dearborn, Michigan, which has the largest Arab American [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=8.08s)]
*  population in the United States. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=12.92s)]
*  In 2024, they flipped to President Trump, partly to protest President Biden's handling [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=15.32s)]
*  of the crisis in Gaza. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=22.0s)]
*  CBS News national correspondent Nikki Patis is in Dearborn, Michigan. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=24.16s)]
*  I recall, Nikki, during the prior to the election that folks were calling President Joe Biden [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=28.5s)]
*  Genocide Joe. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=35.42s)]
*  That was the terminology that was used about President Biden in the way that he was supporting [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=37.1s)]
*  the state of Israel in their attempts to root out terror on the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=43.7s)]
*  And that's why many people felt that he wasn't the right man to be president of the United [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=48.260000000000005s)]
*  States, and so they voted for Trump. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=52.02s)]
*  How are they reacting now to the fact that the president of the United States is suggesting [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=53.74s)]
*  that two million residents in Gaza be somehow removed from their land and the area turned [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=58.42s)]
*  into resorts? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=65.9s)]
*  But you made a really good point. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=69.86s)]
*  It's a point a lot of people here, even those who voted for Trump, want to make. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=71.02s)]
*  We didn't vote necessarily for Trump. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=74.1s)]
*  We voted against Biden. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=75.98s)]
*  The reaction here is mostly outrage, some mixed emotion. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=77.62s)]
*  I spoke with the publisher of the Arab American newspaper here, Osama Zimblani. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=80.94s)]
*  I asked him, what is your reaction to these remarks from Trump? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=86.02000000000001s)]
*  He didn't vote at all, but take a look at what at what he said. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=89.98s)]
*  Outraged. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=93.94s)]
*  I could not believe that the president of the United States is uttering these words. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=95.42s)]
*  Even even Trump, I did not think that he would he would go this far breaking international [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=98.54s)]
*  law and disregard to our own laws. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=104.14s)]
*  We do not regard Gaza as a land that's for grab. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=107.5s)]
*  It's a Palestinian land. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=112.14s)]
*  I was very shocked and surprised. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  He made a point to tell me he didn't vote at all for any presidential candidate. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=119.17999999999999s)]
*  He usually does because he just didn't prefer either. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=123.42s)]
*  I spoke with a young woman, a college senior who voted in her first presidential election. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=126.78s)]
*  She did vote for Trump. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=132.06s)]
*  She said when she saw his remarks on Gaza, she gasped and was initially shocked, but [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=133.74s)]
*  ultimately not surprised. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=138.62s)]
*  And I said, do you regret in any way voting for him? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=140.3s)]
*  And she said, maybe. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=142.94s)]
*  But if I hadn't and Kamala Harris had won, maybe we wouldn't still have a ceasefire. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=144.38s)]
*  Gives you some sense of the feeling here, Vlad. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=149.5s)]
*  Really quickly before you go, what do they plan on doing about it? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=152.94s)]
*  I mean, are they going to campaign against candidates who the president is supporting [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=156.85999999999999s)]
*  in the midterm elections and possibly in the next presidential election? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=162.14s)]
*  I think many of them haven't thought that far. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=168.54s)]
*  There were some protesters in the Capitol here in Michigan, but there definitely has [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=170.06s)]
*  been strong feelings. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=175.26s)]
*  Arab Americans for Trump Organization, not affiliated with the Trump campaign, but [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=179.74s)]
*  outreach, did a lot of outreach for him, actually changed their name yesterday to [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=184.7s)]
*  Arab Americans for Peace. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=190.14000000000001s)]
*  So that gives you an idea of what the feeling is here and what we might see going forward. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=191.74s)]
*  Well, I guess I'm sure the president of the United States will be really worried about [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=196.86s)]
*  that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=199.66s)]
*  Okay, Nikki Batiste, thank you very much with a really important report from Dearborn, Michigan. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=200.46s)]
*  Nikki, thank you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKcfmO_9BA&t=205.57999999999998s)]
