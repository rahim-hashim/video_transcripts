# Egg prices expected to go even higher due to shortage from bird flu
**CBS News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg)
*  All right, with prices soaring, ordering an omelet these days is also more expensive. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=0.0s)]
*  In fact, just last week, Waffle House announced it was charging an egg fee. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=7.28s)]
*  The average cost of a dozen grade A large eggs in the U.S. last month was $4.95. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=13.08s)]
*  That is a 96% increase from the same time last year. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  Ouch. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=22.72s)]
*  And the Department of Agriculture says egg prices could shoot up another 20% this year. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=23.72s)]
*  But the high prices haven't slowed demand. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=28.64s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Lana Zach spoke with one egg farmer in Iowa who has a wait list [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  of people hoping for a carton. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=35.92s)]
*  How has it been with the egg shortage for you guys? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=39.36s)]
*  It's been pretty intense. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=43.68s)]
*  We actually have a little calendar that we write people's names down and we're out about [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=44.68s)]
*  two weeks in advance. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=50.620000000000005s)]
*  If you want eggs, you have to get mine. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=52.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=55.44s)]
*  For more on the rising cost of eggs, we have CBS News Money Watch correspondent Kelly O'Grady [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=56.44s)]
*  here in Studio 57. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=60.599999999999994s)]
*  And we've spoken about this widespread bird flu outbreak and how that's kind of triggered [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=62.44s)]
*  this. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=67.56s)]
*  But help us understand why eggs are so expensive right now and why they will continue to be. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=68.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=72.2s)]
*  So the bird flu, you have a shortage of eggs. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=73.2s)]
*  You have millions of chickens that have had to been cold from that herd. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=75.42s)]
*  So that's one reason, just because there is simply not enough eggs to fill that demand. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=80.12s)]
*  But even if you go back to 2019, eggs have risen 170%. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=84.5s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=88.78s)]
*  And so there's a couple of other factors like rising costs of feed, of labor, of fuel. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=89.78s)]
*  It's sort of, you see this in other areas of farming. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=95.14s)]
*  I mean, we got inflation data. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=97.78s)]
*  Meat was up 6%. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=99.7s)]
*  So it's not just eggs. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=101.5s)]
*  It's just that the situation is exacerbated because of this current bird flu. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=102.94s)]
*  And we've seen images on social media of people at Costco hoarding eggs. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=106.46000000000001s)]
*  We're hearing about people having to get in line. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=110.5s)]
*  One at a time at Trader Joe's to get eggs. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=112.26s)]
*  Eggs are sometimes used in nice drinks. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=114.62s)]
*  Egg whites. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=116.5s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=117.5s)]
*  Careful for your cocktails. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=118.5s)]
*  But what does this mean for retailers then in all these different areas who also have [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=119.5s)]
*  to adjust to this supply demand problem? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=122.54s)]
*  Well, they're having to navigate that frustration too when customers come in. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=124.7s)]
*  Like I was at Costco the other week and I'm like, there's nothing here. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=128.18s)]
*  They didn't have any. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=131.14000000000001s)]
*  They didn't have any. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=132.14000000000001s)]
*  And we're a big egg family. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=133.14000000000001s)]
*  So look, they are trying to ration. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=135.02s)]
*  You can get one dozen, one carton every time you go. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=138.26s)]
*  Kroger, Walmart, Costco, Whole Foods, all of these different retailers are having to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=142.38s)]
*  ration that every time you go, you can only get a certain amount. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=146.82s)]
*  But as you say, right, you do have people who are hoarding, who are going back into [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=150.14s)]
*  the store multiple times, multiple transactions, because eggs are such an important component [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=153.82s)]
*  protein-wise for those nutritional meals. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=159.26s)]
*  I was going to say, me and my egg whites. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=162.18s)]
*  This is key. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=164.29999999999998s)]
*  When might we see some relief then? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=165.29999999999998s)]
*  I don't get any hints that we'll see that anytime soon. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=166.7s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=169.61999999999998s)]
*  So the USDA projects that we're going to see a 20% increase on top of where we are by the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=170.61999999999998s)]
*  end of the year. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=175.06s)]
*  And it takes so long to get these herds back up and running because if there is just one [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=176.73999999999998s)]
*  bird, even if it's a large corporation that has thousands and millions of chickens, they [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=182.33999999999997s)]
*  have to cull the whole herd. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=187.66s)]
*  And then it takes about eight months from when the chicken hatches to when they are [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=189.2s)]
*  back into that egg producing stage. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=192.62s)]
*  How does that then impact the bigger inflationary picture? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=195.22s)]
*  Because that means we're all going to feel these higher costs in the short term. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=198.06s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=200.85999999999999s)]
*  And so you will see people turning to other sources of protein if they can't get eggs. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=201.85999999999999s)]
*  And so what does that do? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=206.38s)]
*  That increases demand and it increases prices on other types of foods. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=207.57999999999998s)]
*  Yikes. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=211.34s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=212.34s)]
*  We'll find another place for our drinks, our eggs, and our protein. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=213.34s)]
*  We'll keep having you back. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=214.94s)]
*  Kelly, thank you so much. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=215.94s)]
*  Great to have you here. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFq3DQONFXg&t=216.94s)]
