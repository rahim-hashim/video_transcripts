# New details on Delta plane crash in Toronto
**CBS News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg)
*  So let's take you to Canada right now where we are getting an update live and in real time right here on CBS News 24 7 on the plane crash that happened. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=0.0s)]
*  And Toronto Pearson's Fire Chief Todd Aiken and Khalil Laramette from our COO of Toronto Pearson. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=7.0s)]
*  With that I'd like to welcome Toronto Pearson CEO Deborah Flint who will take a couple of questions after her remarks. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=16.0s)]
*  Following that our first responders are available to also answer some questions. Thank you. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=25.0s)]
*  Thank you Karen and good morning to all. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=32.0s)]
*  We are providing a third update this morning on yesterday's events as the accident transitions to the investigation phase. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=36.0s)]
*  And I will share more on that investigation phase and what to expect shortly. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=45.0s)]
*  First however, it's really important to recognize how grateful we are that there was no loss of life or life threatening injuries in yesterday's accident. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=50.0s)]
*  You know every time you board a flight you are greeted by flight attendants and by flight crew often. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=61.0s)]
*  It's their job to make us comfortable and confident about the flight ahead and they do an incredible job with that. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=68.0s)]
*  But we saw the most important role that they play in action yesterday. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=75.0s)]
*  The crew of Delta Flight 4819 heroically led passengers to safety evacuating a jet that had overturned on the runway on landing that was amidst smoke and fire. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=80.0s)]
*  I thank each and every one of these heroes, every flight attendant and crew member on Delta Flight 4819. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=94.0s)]
*  I also thank every flight attendant and crew member across the industry. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=102.0s)]
*  Thank you for all that you do every day and every night in service of safe air travel. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=106.0s)]
*  In regards to the accident yesterday at approximately 2 15 p.m. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=113.0s)]
*  Delta Airlines Flight 4819 from Minneapolis to Toronto operated by subsidiary Endeavour Air was involved in a single aircraft accident upon landing at Toronto Pearson. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=118.0s)]
*  The plane was carrying four crew and 76 passengers among them 22 Canadians. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=131.0s)]
*  Flight attendants, flight crews and airport emergency workers and responders mounted a textbook response reaching the site within minutes and quickly evacuating the passengers. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=138.0s)]
*  At the time there were 21 injured passengers ranging from minor to critical but not life threatening injuries. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=150.0s)]
*  A total of 19 passengers went to the local hospitals with two more going to hospitals in the time period after. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=159.0s)]
*  At this time Delta Airlines has reported that 19 of those passengers have been released and two remain hospitalized. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=167.0s)]
*  Our thoughts go out to all of the passengers impacted and their families. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=175.0s)]
*  We have taken great time and care to extend care to each of the passengers that were here after the accident. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=181.0s)]
*  That includes comfort as well as support in their emotional well-being in the hours since the crash. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=189.0s)]
*  We have completed the reunification process for all of the remaining passengers and we'll continue to care for them during this extended time. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=196.0s)]
*  I will now give you more information about the operations at Pearson yesterday and what to expect in the days ahead. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=205.0s)]
*  From last Thursday to Sunday Toronto Pearson saw extreme conditions, two separate snowstorms. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=213.0s)]
*  On Thursday and Sunday we got more than 20 inches, 50 centimeters of accumulated snow. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=220.0s)]
*  That is actually not typical. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=227.0s)]
*  In fact it is more snow within that time window than we received in all of last winter. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=229.0s)]
*  There were many delays and cancellations across this part of Canada and the US Northeast during this time creating numerous flight delays and backlogs. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=235.0s)]
*  At Toronto Pearson 221 of 974 scheduled flights were cancelled on Thursday. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=245.0s)]
*  75 of 1012 scheduled flights were cancelled on Friday. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=253.0s)]
*  128 of 937 scheduled flights were cancelled on Saturday and 371 of 987 scheduled flights were cancelled on Sunday. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=258.0s)]
*  Monday was a clear day though and it was an operational recovery day for Toronto Pearson with 1006 scheduled flights. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=272.0s)]
*  The results yesterday in due part to the accident were 462 scheduled flights cancelled and 544 flights operated. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=281.0s)]
*  Let's now talk about the investigation and what to expect in the next few days as we pivot to this phase. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=291.0s)]
*  Last night seven members of the Transportation Safety Board of Canada arrived at Toronto Pearson to begin the investigation. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=299.0s)]
*  13 more of those investigators arrived today. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=307.0s)]
*  Members of the US Federal Aviation Administration are also here on site participating in the investigation. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=311.0s)]
*  As it is a Mitsubishi aircraft Mitsubishi will be here on site as well and Delta Airlines has sent their go team who are already here on site. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=318.0s)]
*  So what does this all mean for operations at Toronto Pearson today and in the days ahead? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=328.0s)]
*  Our Emergency Operations Centre does remain open though operations on the runways resumed at 5pm Eastern time yesterday. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=334.0s)]
*  We have been in recovery mode since resuming flights at 5pm yesterday catching up on delayed flights and that continues into today as well. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=344.0s)]
*  We are currently without use of our longest east-west and north-south runways. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=354.0s)]
*  This and ongoing expected additional weather conditions today will affect how fast we recover operations particularly with departure of aircraft. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=360.0s)]
*  We do expect that the investigators on site will be reviewing the aircraft on its current configuration on the runway for the next 48 hours. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=370.0s)]
*  And we are looking to get to support that investigation and the removal of that aircraft off the runway at which point we can do our inspections and then return that runway into service. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=381.0s)]
*  Toronto Pearson will continue to provide you all with operational updates but this is now an active investigation time and you can expect to start hearing more from the investigating authorities about the accident that happened here. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=394.0s)]
*  We expect that the Transportation Safety Board of Canada will be issuing a statement with more information around that later this afternoon. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=410.0s)]
*  In closing, I thank the industry, the community and all of our employees here and across the sector for all the work that they are doing to support this incident and those affected and that they do every day. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=419.0s)]
*  Air travel remains the safest form of transportation. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=433.0s)]
*  We are proud of that record here and at time like these we are very grateful and thankful of how the community and the industry comes together as one. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=437.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=446.0s)]
*  We'll now take a few questions. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=449.0s)]
*  Folks who maybe can come up to the mics if possible or if there's a mic in the audience. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=454.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=458.0s)]
*  Hi there. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=463.0s)]
*  Alex Capriolo with News Nation. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=464.0s)]
*  A question about the conditions yesterday. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=466.0s)]
*  Obviously you just explained the extent of the snowstorms that came over the past few days. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=469.0s)]
*  Wondering if there's been any developments or any comment about what exactly it was like on the runway in terms of iciness or wind gusts. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=475.0s)]
*  Last night we heard the fire chief say that he did not believe that that played a role in this crash at all. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=483.0s)]
*  Is that still the theory here and if so do we have any developments on what caused the crash if it wasn't weather related? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=489.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=495.0s)]
*  Yeah, this would not be a time for us to have theory or to speculate on what caused the crash. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=496.0s)]
*  So as I shared, you know, we have a number of agencies that are here that are responsible for doing a thorough and full and complete investigation to determine all the causal factors. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=503.0s)]
*  And we are looking forward to getting those results and to sharing those and those will be shared very publicly once they are received. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=514.0s)]
*  And I understand that if you don't want to speculate about the crash. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=520.0s)]
*  But can you tell us then what the condition of the runway was like at that time of the of the impact? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=523.0s)]
*  I mean, was it slick? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=528.0s)]
*  Have your teams been able to determine that? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=530.0s)]
*  I look forward to sharing all of that information at the proper time. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=532.0s)]
*  Again, that is all that those are all the details that are going to be covered during this investigation and that is active currently. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=536.0s)]
*  Vyosei from the New York Times. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=543.0s)]
*  I have one question and a follow up. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=545.0s)]
*  Does air traffic control handle CRJs differently than other aircraft in crosswinds? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=547.0s)]
*  The air traffic control is responsible, NAV Canada, for all of the aircraft activity here at Toronto Pearson and in the surrounding areas. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=551.0s)]
*  They will have to respond differently themselves as to how they manage those aircraft uniquely. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=562.0s)]
*  And how do you decide to pause operations because of wind and who makes that decision? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=567.0s)]
*  That is a cross collected decision that is made between NAV Canada and the pilots during live operations. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=572.0s)]
*  We are not pausing operations. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=580.0s)]
*  We do have a slowdown in the operations due to two of our runways being closed for operations at this time. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=582.0s)]
*  And those are the key contributing factors to the delays. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=590.0s)]
*  Last question. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=592.0s)]
*  There is no Delta or TSB representatives on the stage with you right now. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=593.0s)]
*  Are you able to speak to why they are not present? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=596.0s)]
*  We have been very much in communication with all of those involved. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=598.0s)]
*  All of the agencies, Delta Airlines and others. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=602.0s)]
*  We have all had quite extensive communication. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=605.0s)]
*  They have been in our EOC, our Emergency Operations Centre. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=607.0s)]
*  So the system and the response to the accident is working as planned and going quite well with our partners. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=611.0s)]
*  John Warrow with the Associated Press. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=623.0s)]
*  Two questions. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=625.0s)]
*  One is the two people who remain in the hospital. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=626.0s)]
*  Any timeline on how long they may remain? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=630.0s)]
*  I do not have that information. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=632.0s)]
*  Do you know what condition they are in? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=634.0s)]
*  What we do know is that 19 of those that were hospitalized are no longer hospitalized. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=636.0s)]
*  The two that remain, none face life-threatening injuries from what we have been briefed and what Delta Airlines has released as well. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=641.0s)]
*  And just finally, Deborah, given what we saw from all the videos that are on social media, and I am sure what you have seen internally, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=648.0s)]
*  is it more remarkable that everyone was able to survive this incident? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=656.0s)]
*  There are so many factors that lead us to have gratitude today. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=665.0s)]
*  Again, I cannot commend enough the crew, the flight attendants, pilots and our emergency responders for their quick and effective response. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=668.0s)]
*  It is really, really incredible. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=678.0s)]
*  And when you see that aircraft, it just makes you really thankful for all the safety checks that go into running this one of the world's safest air transportation systems. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=680.0s)]
*  Okay, we will take questions now for the first responders, please. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=695.0s)]
*  Good morning. Moamang Karashi from 680 News Radio. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=699.0s)]
*  My question really is, last check, the wreckage was still out there on the runway. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=702.0s)]
*  I just wanted to know how long that will be out there and what kind of impact that is having on service here at the airport. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=707.0s)]
*  Yeah, so as I shared, yes, the remains of the aircraft will remain on the runway while the investigators are performing their reviews. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=714.0s)]
*  We expect that that could be about 48 hours. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=724.0s)]
*  And so until that time, two of our runways will remain closed, and that is affecting the volume of traffic that we're having. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=727.0s)]
*  So passengers should be looking and working with their airlines, checking our website for information on delays and potential cancellations as well for the next several days. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=735.0s)]
*  Just as a follow-up to that, then, I've been upstairs, as many of us have, talking to passengers, and many of them, most of them, all of them really are understanding of the ripple effect, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=745.0s)]
*  but are extremely frustrated by the lack of information or conflicting information. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=752.0s)]
*  So just what do you say to your passengers right now who are trying to get themselves on flights to their destinations, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=757.0s)]
*  but are left feeling frustrated by conflicting information or a lack of information? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=761.0s)]
*  We are here very much at the airport to support and provide passenger care for people that might find themselves here at their airport and have their flights disrupted. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=765.0s)]
*  So we'll continue to provide that customer care for them. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=774.0s)]
*  But in the interim, please do check with your airlines, check your website, and check your apps for your most updated flight information. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=778.0s)]
*  Thank you. We'll move now to questions to the responders. Thank you. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=785.0s)]
*  Yeah, sure. It's Shawna with CityNews. Can you talk a little bit about the response, how long it took fire trucks to get to the plane, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=791.0s)]
*  and can you talk a little bit about the flame that we saw in the video and the smoke, and was it easy to put out? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=800.0s)]
*  And just really take us through the response. All right, Todd. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=807.0s)]
*  Thank you for the question. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=810.0s)]
*  The actual time, it was a very quick response from Toronto Person Fire Emergency Services. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=815.0s)]
*  Upon arrival, the crew did witness spot fires. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=821.0s)]
*  They were able to quickly knock down the spot fires using the aircraft rescue firefighting apparatus. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=825.0s)]
*  Once the fires were knocked down, the crews did make entry and perform primary search and rescue. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=830.0s)]
*  The passengers were all evacuated, and then they were taken to a secondary location at Station 2 for triage with our mutual aid partners. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=838.0s)]
*  Just a quick follow-up. Can you describe what it was like, because we've seen videos of the passengers hanging upside down in their seat belts. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=849.0s)]
*  Can you maybe just describe what it was like to get these people hanging, cut down, and out of the plane? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=857.0s)]
*  I believe that most of the passengers self-evacuated at that time, and upon arrival, they were being escorted to a second location. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=865.0s)]
*  Hello, Nate Foy, Fox News. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=885.0s)]
*  I'm just seeking some clarity from a first responder's perspective on the elements and how they played a role in your efforts yesterday. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=887.0s)]
*  I know a lot of people are hoping for some clarity on what the fire chief said, and it sounds like you guys won't give us that. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=895.0s)]
*  But can you tell me what it was like out there on the runway as you were doing your job? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=901.0s)]
*  Was the runway dry and the wind gusts? How did it impact you? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=906.0s)]
*  And like we made it very early to make any conclusions, I know I provided a little bit of information yesterday for transparency. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=910.0s)]
*  Today, now we have an active investigation. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=920.0s)]
*  Therefore, any of those questions would have to be directed toward Transportation Safety Board. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=924.0s)]
*  Hi there. Karen Lieberman with the New York Times. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=934.0s)]
*  Hi there. Karen Lieberman with Global News. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=938.0s)]
*  Besides the chief, I just wondered if any of the other first responders could speak to their own experiences and what you found and how you cared for some of these passengers. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=940.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=948.0s)]
*  Thank you for the question. Mark Andrews, Deputy Chief of Peel Regional Police. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=953.0s)]
*  I'd like to, before I answer the question, I'd like to say that our thoughts and prayers are with the 76 crew members and four passengers and their families that were impacted by yesterday's events, which fortunately had the best possible outcome for all of us. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=957.0s)]
*  Our response as Peel Regional Police, we're the police of jurisdiction. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=978.0s)]
*  We have a really robust presence here at the airport. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=985.0s)]
*  We actually have a fully functioning division with a hundred officers and civilians located. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=989.0s)]
*  We have a presence on the public side and the private side. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=996.0s)]
*  So we were able to respond in a very timely fashion, along with our first responders partners. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=999.0s)]
*  The conditions were difficult, but I will say this, that we regularly practice with our partners in fire and EMS and the GTAA and Transport Safety Canada. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1007.0s)]
*  So we were prepared for this event as extreme as it was. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1018.0s)]
*  And our men and women, not only in policing, but across all the first responder services, did a tremendous job. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1023.0s)]
*  And in my mind, no doubt saved lives. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1032.0s)]
*  So I'd like to acknowledge that. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1036.0s)]
*  There was some impact on the police of jurisdiction being ourselves, not only here at the airport, because as you can imagine, we don't have surge capacity to deal with something like this the way they do in the private industry. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1038.0s)]
*  So, you know, we had at one point we had 50 police officers responding to the circumstances here at the airport and the surrounding environment. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1054.0s)]
*  What I'd like to do is thank our partners at the OPP, the commission of Tom Creek and Chief Myron Demkew, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1065.0s)]
*  because they supported us through the aftermath of the incident by sending officers to support both of our public divisions, 11 and 12 division in Mississauga. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1076.0s)]
*  You know, all in all, it was a great response by first responders supporting GTAA and our TSB partners. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1087.0s)]
*  But it's something that we've practiced and we're well prepared for should this happen again going forward. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1097.0s)]
*  Mississauga Fire and Communications Services received the 911 call. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1107.0s)]
*  It's called a crash alarm. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1113.0s)]
*  So we get it directly from Pearson into our communication center. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1114.0s)]
*  So we had a very quick response. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1118.0s)]
*  We had six apparatus from Mississauga Fire respond. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1120.0s)]
*  It was a combination of aerials, engines and squads. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1124.0s)]
*  In addition, we sent our command vehicle and also a tanker. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1129.0s)]
*  We also had an acting platoon chief, a district chief and myself that attended the scene. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1134.0s)]
*  I took a position within their emergency operations center. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1140.0s)]
*  Just to reiterate what Deputy just said, annually our firefighters participate in joint training with Pearson Fire at a location called Festy. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1144.0s)]
*  It's a training facility. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1156.0s)]
*  Our primary response is to assist with water supply, search and rescue, rehab and medical support. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1157.0s)]
*  The Mississauga Fire and Emergency Services and Mississauga Office of Emergency Management participates in two annual emergency exercises that are held at Toronto Pearson International Airport each year, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1165.0s)]
*  including a high level tabletop command exercise and a full scale boots on the ground emergency exercise. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1182.0s)]
*  In addition to the exercises conducted each year at Toronto Pearson International Airport, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1191.0s)]
*  the City of Mississauga conducts its own functional emergency exercise. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1197.0s)]
*  And we did that in 2021, examining an aircraft accident occurring within the City of Mississauga. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1202.0s)]
*  This exercise included partners from various organizations, including those represented in the exercises held here regularly at Pearson. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1211.0s)]
*  The Mississauga Fire and Emergency Services and OEM provides emergency management training to regional partners from various organizations who may be involved in the response to an aircraft accident, amongst other emergencies. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1222.0s)]
*  The Mississauga Office of Emergency Management can also serve as a conduit between the city and the Provincial Emergency Operations Centre if provincial wide coordination for the response and recovery of community impacts during an emergency is required. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1239.0s)]
*  During an aircraft accident, the Mississauga Office of Emergency Management can assist in the coordination of providing municipal services if requested by our community partners who may be impacted in the event. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1257.0s)]
*  This could include transportation like buses, facilities or heavy equipment. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1273.0s)]
*  The City of Mississauga has developed its own aircraft accident emergency plan, which conforms with and operates in conjunction to the airport emergency plan developed by the Greater Toronto Airport Authority. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1280.0s)]
*  Thanks. That was a fulsome response. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1296.0s)]
*  I just also wondered if anyone can speak to the nature of some of the injuries. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1301.0s)]
*  Do you want to speak to some of the nature? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1305.0s)]
*  Good afternoon. My name is Corey Takach. I'm a commander of operations within Peel Regional Paramedic Services. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1313.0s)]
*  So upon our arrival of the crash site, our staff were faced with a multitude of different injuries, mainly stemming from back sprains, head injuries, anxiety, some headaches, nausea and vomiting due to the fuel exposure. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1320.0s)]
*  So those were the common sort of injuries that we had come across. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1341.0s)]
*  Any more questions? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1350.0s)]
*  Please. Malhamidi Canadian Press. Just want to follow up on this rescue effort. Can you please provide some details on the timeline? How long did you, I mean paramedics, paramedics and firefighters, did it take for them to get to the airplane and how long did it take for them to evacuate the airplane? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1351.0s)]
*  Okay, Todd, you want to take that? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1369.0s)]
*  Yeah, the response from Toronto Pearson Fire and Emergency Services was minutes. Because there is an active investigation, we won't be able to provide the details. But it was a very quick response from Fire and Emergency Services as well as our response partners that just spoke. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1374.0s)]
*  Can you please also comment on the role that flight attendants played in evacuating the airplane? We saw some videos on social media. There's basically doing their job, helping passengers get off the plane. Can you please comment on their role in this? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1389.0s)]
*  Sure, absolutely. We train for such events. We're very well prepared and trained. And the firefighters responded textbook. They were able to knock down the fire. They're able to assist the passengers getting off the plane and then performing triage and then response to the hospitals. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1403.0s)]
*  Thank you. Next question. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1427.0s)]
*  Hi, I'm Alex Miller with Scripps News. I know you can't confirm what you saw on the runway, but can you confirm that the runway had been coded as fives across the board as a wet runway for the pilots, which is a runway with light, snow or slush? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1428.0s)]
*  I don't know if I followed that question. Do you want to repeat it? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1445.0s)]
*  Like I mentioned earlier, because there is an active investigation, that will have to be directed towards the Transport Safety Board, please. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1452.0s)]
*  Hi, Jessica Murphy, BBC News. I want to go back to something Mr. Andrews said. You talked about difficult conditions that rescuers faced on the ground. I'm hoping you can go into a bit more detail. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1465.0s)]
*  Sorry, with who said? Sorry? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1476.0s)]
*  BBC. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1478.0s)]
*  Oh, no, sorry. Peel Regional Police. Peel Regional Police. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1479.0s)]
*  Thank you for that question. The conditions that I was speaking of is the environmental conditions, the cold, the wind, the fact that we were still having the occasional snow. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1488.0s)]
*  But those are conditions, again, that we're used to working in as first responders, and our people, along with the other first responders, did a tremendous job of responding in those conditions. It's part of the environment that we operated. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1500.0s)]
*  Megan Fitzpatrick from CBC News. What can you tell us about the child that was airlifted to sick kids? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1518.0s)]
*  You've been listening to a wide-ranging news conference from various officials there in Canada responding to the fact that you do see a Delta Airlines plane belly up there still all of these hours later on a runway, knowing that 80 people survived, but many of those are injured, two people in critical condition. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1524.0s)]
*  That news conference revealing so far the path to finding answers, but largely not providing many answers. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1543.0s)]
*  So let's drill down. Former NTSB Air Safety Investigator Gregory Fype. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1550.0s)]
*  Gregory, good to have you with us. An airplane flipped upside down, that Delta logo upside down, not a great look. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1555.0s)]
*  Are you taken back by the fact that Delta Airlines didn't have somebody in the room there at that podium? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1561.0s)]
*  I'm kind of curious as to why they didn't at least have some of their care team people, though that's the team that typically the airline will have to assist any of the passengers. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1567.0s)]
*  So I'm surprised that they didn't have that. But again, that's Canada. They run their own type of investigation here in the United States. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1579.0s)]
*  Of course, the NTSB with our Family Assistance Act, there was there would typically be a representative, but I'm sure that Delta Airlines and Endeavor are working with the passengers and the families of those passengers to provide them whatever support they need. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1588.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, and something that did come out of that news conference is an understanding of 24 hours and 48 hours before this crash happened. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1606.0s)]
*  So many flights canceled in the days leading up, but it looks like at least for the day of this incident, they felt like they could start catching up. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1615.0s)]
*  Do you agree with them catching up and letting flights land, even in the bad weather conditions that we know were present during the crash? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1623.0s)]
*  Well, when you think about it, Reid, the airport, yes, they have control over operations, but it really is determined by pilots and airlines as to whether or not it is safe to operate at that airport under specific weather conditions. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1631.0s)]
*  And in this case, because the visibility was good, it was really a wind condition. That's a very subjective thing. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1647.0s)]
*  The airlines do set standards and the pilots have to not only be trained to it, but they have to abide by whatever those standards are. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1653.0s)]
*  The question that's going to be one of the many questions that's going to be answered or needs answers is crew qualifications and the fact that they'll be looking at experience, they'll be looking at their training, their background, their history and previous experience under these types of conditions, possibly even to this airport. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1661.0s)]
*  Those are a lot of the questions that will have to be answered during the interview process with the flight crew. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1680.0s)]
*  So this was also something that was caught on so many different cameras from so many vantage points. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1686.0s)]
*  What role does video have to play in studying whether this plane functioned correctly, whether the landing gear was all the way down? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1693.0s)]
*  Because to me, it looks like a belly landing and a very hard landing at that. Tell me about video and the crucial role that video will play in this. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1701.0s)]
*  Video in this day and age is unbelievably good, especially for accident investigators. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1708.0s)]
*  When I first started with the NTSB a long time ago, we depended on witness statements, trying to track down witnesses and then ferret out fact from fiction. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1714.0s)]
*  Now we have these electronic witnesses, as I refer to them. That's video. They don't lie. They don't make up a story. The video is the video. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1725.0s)]
*  And now the analysis by investigators takes place. In this particular instance, with these new videos that have surfaced over the last 24 hours, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1733.0s)]
*  they really give a good representation as to what the aircraft was doing in the final moments before touchdown. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1743.0s)]
*  And you can tell from this video that the aircraft went to a right-wing low attitude. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1751.0s)]
*  The brunt of the impact or the high energy impact on landing was on the right side. That's what failed the right wing. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1756.0s)]
*  The aircraft then slid on its right side. The left wing continued to produce lift, which rolled the airplane over. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1764.0s)]
*  You can see that from the left wing coming over the top. So all of these things help investigators not only determine what the aircraft was doing prior to touchdown, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1772.0s)]
*  but what happened after touchdown. Right. And the examination into what went wrong, very crucial, very important, but also important. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1782.0s)]
*  And we have about 15, 20 seconds left. Also very important looking at what went right. And it looks like these passengers had their seatbelts on. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1789.0s)]
*  We all land. We all know. Stow your items. Get your seatbelt on. It looks like that is something that went right here and potentially saved lives. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1797.0s)]
*  Absolutely. It's all about passenger situational awareness. Sinching up that seatbelt and really understanding where you are in relation to an exit. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1805.0s)]
*  That's what's going to help you, especially given the fact that this airplane had rolled upside down. So now the ceiling is the floor and the floor is the ceiling. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1814.0s)]
*  All right, Gregory. Thank you so much for that conversation. We appreciate it so very much. I'm going to abide by every rule right before a landing, as always. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwMgoWc2cg&t=1822.0s)]
