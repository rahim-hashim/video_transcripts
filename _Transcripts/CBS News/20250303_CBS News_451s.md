# Trump's tariffs on Canada and Mexico to take effect in hours
**CBS News:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks)
*  Welcome back to America Decides. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=0.0s)]
*  Thanks for staying with us. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=1.72s)]
*  We are just hours away from President Trump's decision, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  which is pending, to place large tariffs [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=7.08s)]
*  on United States trading partners, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=10.88s)]
*  namely Canada, Mexico, China. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=12.88s)]
*  Barring an intervention by the president last minute, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=15.32s)]
*  at midnight tonight, the US will impose 25% tariffs [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=17.76s)]
*  on all imports, all imports from Canada and Mexico. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Tariffs on goods from China will increase [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=27.84s)]
*  from 10% to 20%. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=29.8s)]
*  And I wanna bring in Kelly O'Grady and Sarah McGregor [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=32.12s)]
*  for reporting and analysis on this. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=34.6s)]
*  Kelly is a CBS News Money Watch correspondent. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=36.84s)]
*  Sarah, the managing editor [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=39.68s)]
*  for Bloomberg News' national desk. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  Kelly, let me start with you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  So we have a, this is not a stock market show, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=45.3s)]
*  but let's put up a graphic [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  about what happened to the Dow today. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=50.64s)]
*  Down about 650 points. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=53.32s)]
*  It was at one point, almost a thousand points down. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=56.2s)]
*  There was tremendous volatility, not just in the Dow, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=60.52s)]
*  but the other major indexes. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=63.24s)]
*  The NASDAQ was down 1%. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=64.84s)]
*  The S&P down 1.76%. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=67.0s)]
*  Is almost all of that volatility driven by concern [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=70.04s)]
*  over these pending tariffs? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=73.42s)]
*  It absolutely was, Major. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=75.86s)]
*  And in fact, you can look at when President Trump spoke [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=77.2s)]
*  those words that, well, this is actually happening. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=81.12s)]
*  We are going to see those tariffs placed [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=83.94s)]
*  on Canada and Mexico at midnight. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=85.7s)]
*  You saw the Dow go like this, the NASDAQ go like this, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=87.89999999999999s)]
*  and the S&P go like this. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=90.62s)]
*  Now, as you mentioned, we didn't close on session lows, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=92.17999999999999s)]
*  but there's a lot of concern from companies, retailers. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=96.14s)]
*  If you looked at the auto stocks, Ford, GM, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=99.97999999999999s)]
*  they were all down over 1%, some even 3%. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=102.86s)]
*  So yeah, there's a lot of concern. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=106.78s)]
*  I think a lot of investors were hoping [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=108.22s)]
*  that there was going to be an 11th hour deal [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=109.92s)]
*  when we got that information that this is indeed [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=112.02s)]
*  going through as of now. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=114.25999999999999s)]
*  It pretty much fell off a cliff. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=115.82s)]
*  Sarah, Kelly mentioned autos. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=118.14s)]
*  I did some checking and I hope these numbers are correct. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=120.25999999999999s)]
*  In 2023, the United States exported about 65 billion [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=122.74s)]
*  in autos, imported 208 billion, 45 billion of auto imports [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=126.25999999999999s)]
*  from Mexico, number one, 35 billion in auto imports [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=131.46s)]
*  from Canada, they're number three. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=135.3s)]
*  That's a lot of cars coming from those two countries. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=137.96s)]
*  And if there are 25% tariffs, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=141.22s)]
*  and we'll get to auto parts in a second, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=143.14000000000001s)]
*  but just on cars, consumers will see that, feel that, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=145.06s)]
*  and that might materially change the marketplace, right? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=149.22s)]
*  Absolutely, I've seen data that car prices [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=154.26000000000002s)]
*  are already an average of about $50,000 now [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=156.70000000000002s)]
*  with all the new electronics and sort of high tech cars, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=159.42000000000002s)]
*  the move to EVs. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=162.66s)]
*  So already car prices are pretty high comparably. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=163.58s)]
*  And I think that is the threat [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=166.38s)]
*  that this could really drive those up further. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=168.20000000000002s)]
*  There's statistics about the number of times [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=171.88s)]
*  that car parts go across the border. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=173.28s)]
*  This is a really fluid border. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  Of course, we've had NAFTA, USMCA, now as it's known, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=177.4s)]
*  in place for decades now. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=181.0s)]
*  And I think that people are really used to that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=182.28s)]
*  And at the same time, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=185.68s)]
*  Trump really wants to speak to his audience. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=186.92s)]
*  And when we talk about cars, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=188.72s)]
*  that's an industry that's near and dear to Americans' hearts. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=190.28s)]
*  I think they really feel like that represents America, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=192.78s)]
*  the auto industry, the support that comes from it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  So there's a lot at stake with these tariffs. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  And I think that's what the car industry [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=201.62s)]
*  and the car industry really represents that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=202.85999999999999s)]
*  And Kelly, there was an announcement at the White House today [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=205.26s)]
*  about $100 billion of investment. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=208.06s)]
*  We don't know if it's new. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=210.9s)]
*  It may have already been planned, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=212.26s)]
*  but it was announced with some fanfare from TSMC. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=214.34s)]
*  That's Taiwan Semiconductor. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=217.18s)]
*  What is the importance of that particular investment? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=219.45999999999998s)]
*  So TSMC, I mean, is almost as important as NVIDIA [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=222.62s)]
*  to the chip industry and sort of the AI race. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=226.57999999999998s)]
*  One, President Trump was able to say, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=230.14s)]
*  hey, I'm putting tariffs on Canada, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=232.61999999999998s)]
*  Mexico, and these other countries. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=234.7s)]
*  At the same time that he was able to say, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=236.54s)]
*  look, you have a company coming [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=238.42s)]
*  and manufacturing their products in the United States. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=240.89999999999998s)]
*  I think that was very timely. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=244.17999999999998s)]
*  The other thing is from a supply chain perspective, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=245.61999999999998s)]
*  from a national security perspective, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=248.14s)]
*  most of TSMC's chips are made in Taiwan. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=250.5s)]
*  Having those chips made here, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=253.89999999999998s)]
*  just as the United States is trying to become the leader, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=255.57999999999998s)]
*  continue to be the leader in artificial intelligence, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=258.66s)]
*  that's a big deal. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=261.58000000000004s)]
*  It's also a big deal. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=262.42s)]
*  It's going to create a lot of jobs, Major. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=263.24s)]
*  And TSMC already has a sizable footprint in Arizona [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=264.78000000000003s)]
*  where this investment, and again, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=267.90000000000003s)]
*  we don't know if it's all brand new [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=269.82000000000005s)]
*  or an addition to what was already contemplated [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=271.5s)]
*  will be in Arizona. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=274.58000000000004s)]
*  That's correct, yes. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=276.38s)]
*  It was referenced Arizona was a big part [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=277.58000000000004s)]
*  of the conversation this afternoon. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=279.66s)]
*  Sarah, the president also made an announcement [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=281.34000000000003s)]
*  over the weekend about a cryptocurrency reserve, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=283.70000000000005s)]
*  and that sparked some applause in the crypto space, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=287.82s)]
*  but also some blowback in Silicon Valley [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=291.09999999999997s)]
*  from those who thought it should all be Bitcoin [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=293.78s)]
*  or there were other things, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=296.09999999999997s)]
*  sort of the libertarian part of Silicon Valley [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=298.38s)]
*  was a little bit perturbed about this. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=300.82s)]
*  There's supposed to be a summit at the end of this week [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=302.46s)]
*  on the future of crypto in America. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=304.65999999999997s)]
*  How do you assess all that? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=306.28s)]
*  We've seen on President and support for President Trump [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=308.82s)]
*  from the tech industry this time around. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=311.38s)]
*  Of course, if we just saw who was [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=313.53999999999996s)]
*  at his inauguration ceremony, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=314.7s)]
*  he is getting a lot of support, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=316.46000000000004s)]
*  and we're just talking about TSMC [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=318.22s)]
*  and this massive investment that they're making. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=320.14000000000004s)]
*  That adds to $1 trillion in spending [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=323.26s)]
*  that has been promised since Trump took office, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=325.72s)]
*  and that's largely companies like Apple, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=328.2s)]
*  Metta, some of these tech companies. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=330.26s)]
*  So we can see a real sort of integration right now [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=332.02000000000004s)]
*  of Trump's support base and sort of some of these promises [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=334.94s)]
*  that he's getting made about investment in the US, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=338.42s)]
*  they are coming from the tech industry. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=340.76s)]
*  So it's interesting how they're playing into each other [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=342.86s)]
*  and some of the promises, like this crypto promise [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=344.98s)]
*  that Trump's making that may play into [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=347.06s)]
*  some of that relationship that they're having, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=349.54s)]
*  that tightening of the relationship. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=351.18s)]
*  And Sarah, I'll ask you, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=353.26s)]
*  and then we'll give Kelly a chance also. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=354.34s)]
*  Kelly talked about, and we highlighted the volatility today, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=356.88s)]
*  but the volatility has been running through the markets [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=360.1s)]
*  basically for the last couple of months, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=362.34s)]
*  and there are some analysts I have read [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=364.18s)]
*  who are a little bit concerned about [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=365.9s)]
*  a softening of the job market [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=367.7s)]
*  and a potential rough sledding for the US economy, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=369.53999999999996s)]
*  quite separate from the tariff conversation. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=374.52000000000004s)]
*  Yes, there's already been some indicators [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=376.24s)]
*  that show a bit of a softening in the economy. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=378.32s)]
*  Of course, other, we talked about some of those [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=380.64000000000004s)]
*  down arrow charts today, the Looney and the peso [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=383.12s)]
*  were also down. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=385.6s)]
*  The enemy of the markets is uncertainty, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=386.92s)]
*  and I think this ongoing tariff war [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=388.84000000000003s)]
*  is really gonna play a part [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=390.64000000000004s)]
*  because we have tariffs that will take effect, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  as we just talked about at 12.01 a.m., [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=394.08000000000004s)]
*  but then there's gonna be retaliation. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=395.86s)]
*  There's probably gonna be an escalation [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  from the Trump administration, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=399.32s)]
*  and again, that continuation's still in the aluminum, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=400.48s)]
*  European tariffs. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=402.52000000000004s)]
*  So straight down the line, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=403.40000000000003s)]
*  we don't know how long these tariffs will be in place for. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=405.04s)]
*  So the markets and the economy writ large, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=407.40000000000003s)]
*  I think, are this uncertainty kind of playing into it. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=410.68s)]
*  It's really hard to see right now how it's gonna play out, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=413.44s)]
*  but there has been a softening. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=415.64s)]
*  Kelly, you get the final word. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=417.68s)]
*  Well, I think it'll be very interesting [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=419.44s)]
*  to hear President Trump tomorrow night. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=421.16s)]
*  He has always looked at the markets [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=422.76s)]
*  as a metric for success, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=424.26s)]
*  and I'll just leave you with this, Major. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=425.88s)]
*  The Atlanta Fed tracks GDP, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=427.72s)]
*  what they're estimating for the quarter [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=430.24s)]
*  could always change, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=432.4s)]
*  but right now, based on that drop in consumer spending [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=433.44s)]
*  we saw last week, it looks like Q1 GDP, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  first quarter GDP, is on track to be negative. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=439.44s)]
*  So that will be sort of the context [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=441.71999999999997s)]
*  around that address he'll be giving tomorrow. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=444.79999999999995s)]
*  Kelly O'Grady, Sarah McGregor, thank you very, very much. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=447.56s)]
*  That was great. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1knAMc6Ks&t=450.23999999999995s)]
