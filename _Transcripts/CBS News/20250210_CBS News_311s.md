# What we know about Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs
**CBS News:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4)
*  President Trump is moving forward with tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to the United [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=0.0s)]
*  States. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=4.44s)]
*  The president signed a proclamation Monday to impose a 25 percent import tax on steel [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=5.44s)]
*  and aluminum goods coming into the country. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=10.64s)]
*  He also threatened to impose reciprocal tariffs to match any duties other countries have on [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=13.36s)]
*  American goods. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=18.38s)]
*  So think of that as a tit for tat retaliation measure. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=19.62s)]
*  Meanwhile, on the legal front, a federal judge has extended a delay on the president's proposed [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=22.56s)]
*  buyouts for federal workers. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=26.92s)]
*  The judge says he will keep the program on pause until he makes a final decision. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=28.88s)]
*  The administration is offering some two million federal workers the choice to accept a deferred [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=33.28s)]
*  resignation. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=38.2s)]
*  Employees who accept will be paid through the end of September, but critics are calling [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=39.2s)]
*  the plan chaotic and argue the administration can change the terms of the deal whenever [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=43.48s)]
*  it wants. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=47.92s)]
*  CBS News White House reporter Aaron Navarro joins us now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=48.92s)]
*  Aaron, we're going to get to tariffs in the moment, in a moment rather, but we just heard [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=52.28s)]
*  Trump made some comments in the Oval Office about Gaza. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=57.78s)]
*  So what did he say? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=61.02s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=63.26s)]
*  Reporters in the Oval Office with President Trump, and we'll see playback of this later, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=64.26s)]
*  said when Trump was asked about Hamas's reported suspension of releasing hostages, President [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=69.3s)]
*  Trump said that if the hostages are not released by noon on Saturday, he would say to cancel [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=75.42s)]
*  the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=80.9s)]
*  Obviously a big comment there, just given the Trump administration's involvement when [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=83.78s)]
*  it came to that ceasefire in December of last year and just generally when it comes to Middle [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=88.38s)]
*  East policy right now. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=93.1s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=94.74000000000001s)]
*  Saturday, I mean, we're definitely going to be watching that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=95.74000000000001s)]
*  But as you said, a major proclamation there. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=97.66s)]
*  I do want to get back to tariffs because we've got some big news there. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=101.18s)]
*  So why is President Trump targeting steel and aluminum? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=105.02000000000001s)]
*  And how soon could these tariffs take effect? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=108.92s)]
*  Yeah, President Trump signed two proclamations establishing a 25 percent tariff on aluminum [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=112.5s)]
*  and steel coming into the U.S., the one that aluminum builds upon a 10 percent tariff that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=119.25999999999999s)]
*  he had in his first administration. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=124.61999999999999s)]
*  He has pitched this and the White House have pitched this tariff in multiple ways, one [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=127.38s)]
*  being to undo some of the tariff agreements that were during President Biden's term, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=132.12s)]
*  during President Biden's tenure when it came to steel tariffs, President Biden came to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=138.22s)]
*  an agreement with the European Union to remove those. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=143.26s)]
*  Trump is putting those back on. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=146.46s)]
*  And he's also arguing that it'll help domestic and U.S. steel companies, just given that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=148.1s)]
*  the prices for foreign steel coming in will be higher. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=153.18s)]
*  He's really banking on that to help U.S. steel, to help domestic companies and the industry [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=156.54s)]
*  here in the U.S. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=161.57999999999998s)]
*  And we saw for some of those companies share prices rise this morning. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=162.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's an interesting point because the argument for tariffs, right, is to incentivize [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=168.02s)]
*  manufacturers to bring some of that production here. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=172.58s)]
*  But then you have aluminum and steel costing more. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=175.66s)]
*  They have to pay more for those input costs. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=179.54s)]
*  So really interesting tension. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=182.02s)]
*  I want to stay on tariffs. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=184.22s)]
*  Have we gotten more clarity from the White House on the terms of those proposed reciprocal [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=185.9s)]
*  tariffs? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=192.26s)]
*  And how are other nations reacting? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=193.26s)]
*  We're expected to hear details of that either Tuesday or Wednesday. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=194.94s)]
*  President Trump said that he would have a news conference to kind of talk and give more [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=199.66s)]
*  details about reciprocal tariffs, which, as you described, they're kind of tit for tat, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  kind of matching tariffs that other countries already have. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=207.94s)]
*  And just given how President Trump, you know, acted with tariffs regarding Canada and Mexico [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=211.5s)]
*  earlier this year, you're seeing other countries, especially those in Europe, really take his [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=217.22s)]
*  threats. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=222.62s)]
*  And as I said about tariffs, seriously, you saw France's foreign minister saying the past [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=223.66s)]
*  day or so that the European Union would replicate any additional tariffs imposed on their countries [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=229.3s)]
*  by America. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=235.66s)]
*  Germany made similar comments in terms of retaliatory response. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=236.66s)]
*  And in Canada, just kind of going back real quick to steel tariffs, you saw Ontario's [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=241.18s)]
*  leader say that Trump is moving the goalposts and saying that this will hurt the economy [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=245.42000000000002s)]
*  especially the linked economy between that part of Canada and auto industries in Detroit. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=250.5s)]
*  So other countries are certainly watching to see and reading what Trump is imposing [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=256.26s)]
*  in regards to tariffs. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=261.02s)]
*  Yeah, watching indeed. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=262.02s)]
*  Real quick before I let you go, Aaron, the legal battle over proposed buyouts for federal [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=263.86s)]
*  workers. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=268.14s)]
*  While we await the judge's final decision, I mean, just how much of the government's [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=269.14s)]
*  workforce could be incentivized to resign if a judge lets the offer stand? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=272.58s)]
*  Yeah, the latest numbers we have heard from the Office of Personnel Management is that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=277.86s)]
*  over 65,000 federal workers have accepted this. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=281.26000000000005s)]
*  This is a bit over 2%, maybe between 2 and 3% of the general federal workforce. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=284.66s)]
*  So a bit shy of the 5% goal that they had. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=290.38s)]
*  But the OPM, the office kind of handling all this, says they don't have a breakdown of [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=293.66s)]
*  the agencies yet, that we do know there have been exemptions for those working in postal [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=298.3s)]
*  service or those working in fields regarding national security. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=302.78s)]
*  Okay, so 2 to 3% or so. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=307.05999999999995s)]
*  Aaron Navarro, thank you. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmDlqUdV8f4&t=309.09999999999997s)]
