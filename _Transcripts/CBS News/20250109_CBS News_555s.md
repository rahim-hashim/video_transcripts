# Wildfire emergency relief efforts underway
**CBS News:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk)
*  President Biden says he's approved a disaster declaration for California as three major [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=0.0s)]
*  fires continue to burn. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=4.8s)]
*  He added the federal government will do everything to assist the state as it deals with this [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  disaster. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=10.56s)]
*  We begin this hour with the warning from the president saying that the fires now are expected [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=11.56s)]
*  to continue, quote, well into next week, but that the federal response will continue to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=15.5s)]
*  be robust with hundreds of federal firefighters joining thousands of local and state firefighters [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=20.04s)]
*  on the ground and dozens of federal aircraft also in the skies helping put out these fires. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=25.759999999999998s)]
*  Let's get another update on the situation right now with CBS News correspondent Tom [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  Hanson who's in Pasadena. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  Tom, what are you seeing at this hour? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=36.12s)]
*  Hey there. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=38.64s)]
*  Well, we're in Pasadena standing outside of the exhibit hall and ballroom. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=39.64s)]
*  Just a week ago, this was the site of the Rose Bowl parade. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=45.16s)]
*  Well, now it has turned into an emergency relief and disaster relief center that's housing [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=48.8s)]
*  some 1200 people, young and old families, single people, the elderly. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  So many people are here and they're not just here from the Pasadena area. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=60.4s)]
*  They're actually here from all over Los Angeles. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=63.959999999999994s)]
*  And I want to take you around here so you can see exactly what we're seeing on the ground. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=67.28s)]
*  You can see that food trucks have lined up over here offering free food for people who [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=71.53999999999999s)]
*  are in need. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=77.67999999999999s)]
*  We've also seen people bringing bottles of water. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=78.67999999999999s)]
*  A woman over here is making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=80.64s)]
*  Really people in this community are doing anything and everything they can in order [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  to help. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=87.82s)]
*  Now this is all unfolding as five fires around Los Angeles continue to rage. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=88.88s)]
*  We are closest to the Eaton fire right now. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=95.06s)]
*  We're about a stone's throw. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=98.64s)]
*  We're not right on the fire line, but we're far enough away. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=99.72s)]
*  We're close enough, I should say, that I don't know if you can see on my shirt, there is [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  a flex of ash that keep on falling out of the sky. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=106.72s)]
*  It kind of feels like little flurries of snow, except for it's ash from the fires. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=110.32s)]
*  That explains why I am wearing this mask. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=115.83999999999999s)]
*  That speaks to not only the immediate danger of the flames, but also the danger that you [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  can't see, which is the air quality in this area. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=123.72s)]
*  As you look up at the sky over here, you can see that the sun is pretty much clouded. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=127.39999999999999s)]
*  That is a layer of smoke that is a blanket of smoke, I should say, in this area. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=132.62s)]
*  And that's what's affecting people. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=138.32s)]
*  So when you're considering that a lot of the people in this area are the elderly, they [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=139.76s)]
*  are especially susceptible to issues and conditions that come with pollution and air pollution [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=144.44s)]
*  in particular. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=151.54s)]
*  So that's front of mind of a lot of the people who are here right now. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=152.54s)]
*  But currently, a lot of the people here are waiting to see what's left of their home. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=156.01999999999998s)]
*  They may have been evacuated and not had a chance to visit the neighborhoods that they [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=160.66s)]
*  left behind. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=166.64s)]
*  In the drop of a hat, time after time, the stories that we've heard are people being [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=168.02s)]
*  woken up in the middle of the night having to leave on a moment's notice to get out of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=173.0s)]
*  the way of the Eaton fire. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=178.22s)]
*  Unfortunately, that fire has claimed hundreds of structures in the Altadena area, which [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=179.98000000000002s)]
*  is nearby here. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=185.8s)]
*  So a lot of people anxiously awaiting a chance to get back to what is left of their homes. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=187.12s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=194.3s)]
*  Tom Henson, thank you. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=196.3s)]
*  You could see the ash, you could hear it in his voice as well. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=197.98s)]
*  It remains a perilous situation there. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=200.61999999999998s)]
*  For more coverage of the fires, let's turn to our colleagues at CBS News Los Angeles, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=202.89999999999998s)]
*  who've been running coverage 24-7 there across Southern California. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=207.66s)]
*  Let's listen in. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=210.98s)]
*  ... county local officials get a briefing on the fire to really understand what the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=211.98s)]
*  needs are as we move forward, not only with regard to the firefight, which Chief Moore [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=216.32s)]
*  but also to regard to support for the population displaced. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=224.54s)]
*  Over 360,000 under mandatory evacuations, hundreds of thousands more with warnings. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=229.82s)]
*  And so what we're doing now is ensuring that we're able to provide any support to provide [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=236.82s)]
*  mass care to individuals, any assistance for the sheltering, any assistance for feeding. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=243.82s)]
*  And then through the programs that we provide through our individual assistance that you [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=250.45999999999998s)]
*  authorized through the declaration, we're able to assist individuals with funding to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=254.45999999999998s)]
*  offset their hotel costs. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=260.97999999999996s)]
*  So applying to FEMA on the 1-800-621-3362 number is important or disasterassistance.gov. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=263.18s)]
*  We're sending teams out to the shelters. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=270.86s)]
*  We know that there'll be a huge need after fires for mental health specialists and working [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=274.06s)]
*  with HHS on providing that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=279.94s)]
*  As the Vice President talked about, insurance is problematic in California, especially with [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=282.78000000000003s)]
*  the fires. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=288.78000000000003s)]
*  And so not only do some of the changes in our authorities help now with those that are [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=290.1s)]
*  underinsured, which we see more and more, but we want those that are insured to start [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=295.02000000000004s)]
*  seeking assistance to their insurance companies. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=299.78000000000003s)]
*  Our programs can help individuals, especially displaced and who have lost their homes with [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  rental assistance until they can rebuild and ultimately provide temporary housing. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=307.34000000000003s)]
*  So we're in discussions with state and local governments on how we will meet those housing [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=312.82s)]
*  needs, both in the interim by using available sockets here, but how can we help rebuild. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=317.1s)]
*  And then lastly, I would just say that we're really focused on already starting to discuss [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=324.02s)]
*  debris removal and all the hazardous waste that comes from fire and how to remove that [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=329.1s)]
*  safely between local, state and federal government. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=333.78s)]
*  We'll rely on federal partners, US EPA, the Corps of Engineers and others to be part of [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=336.9s)]
*  that technical assistance help to support the safe removal so that ultimately we could [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=342.9s)]
*  rebuild. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=350.14s)]
*  And one of the things that we will start doing in the next couple of days is starting that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=351.14s)]
*  discussion on how do we rebuild and not only rebuild, but rebuild more resilient and bring [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=355.74s)]
*  together state and local federal agencies to start that discussion the weeks to months [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=361.38s)]
*  ahead. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=364.94s)]
*  And so right now we're focused on meeting the immediate needs of those displaced, but [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=366.7s)]
*  already starting to work on recovery and rebuild and bringing all our authorities and the full [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=372.14s)]
*  weight of the federal government and all the resources that you've authorized to help California [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=376.9s)]
*  in that endeavor. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=381.9s)]
*  Bob, what do you think the biggest challenge is? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=382.9s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=386.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think the biggest challenge is going to be the mental health stress that is put [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=387.94s)]
*  on individuals that have lost everything. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=398.26s)]
*  Fires are so drastic, they destroy everything very quickly. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=400.94s)]
*  Individuals don't have a lot of notice to leave in, so I think there's going to be a [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=408.3s)]
*  significant mental health strain followed by a need to help individuals recover and [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=411.54s)]
*  rebuild. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=417.34000000000003s)]
*  And the Vice President is exactly right. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=418.82s)]
*  Why I suspect that many have insurance, many are underinsured. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=421.98s)]
*  And insurance is difficult to get and some might have lost their insurance or have been [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=426.82s)]
*  canceled by insurance companies. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=430.62s)]
*  And I think that's something we need to continue to work on as a government at all levels, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=432.62s)]
*  but something where there will be gaps in assistance that we will need to bring in not [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=440.54s)]
*  only federal agencies, but nonprofits, private sector to help meet those needs. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=445.34000000000003s)]
*  I think we're going to have to do that in addition. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=449.62s)]
*  The fact is that the two declarations we signed, I signed, provide for, for example, the rebuilding [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=453.58s)]
*  of churches and schools and certain, but not businesses, not business centers. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=461.86s)]
*  And so that's going to be a gigantic cost as well. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=468.22s)]
*  And but the debris removal is a big deal. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=472.90000000000003s)]
*  And what that's going to take a long time, isn't it? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=476.82000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it will take some time to remove the debris. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=481.82000000000005s)]
*  In California, unfortunately, we've had a lot of experience with fighting fires and [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=486.78000000000003s)]
*  removing debris. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=492.26000000000005s)]
*  And so it will take months to a year. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=494.18s)]
*  This is a very widespread with significant damage to infrastructure. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=496.7s)]
*  And we want to not only immediately remove the hazards, things like propane tanks, some [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=502.18s)]
*  of the power cells that are there and other contaminants that may be in households and [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=506.14s)]
*  make sure that they're safe to reenter and relook for personal effects. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=513.98s)]
*  But then the second part is removing that ash. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=518.8199999999999s)]
*  And what we've done before is help people with the removal so that we can get down [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MQP6tRypXk&t=522.54s)]
