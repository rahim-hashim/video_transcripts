# Trump official dismantling USAID secretly met with Christian nationalists abroad, report says
**CBS News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg)
*  Welcome back to America Decides. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=0.0s)]
*  New reporting is shedding light on the man at the State Department in charge of dismantling [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=3.08s)]
*  USAID. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=8.0s)]
*  ProPublica revealed that Peter Morocco secretly met with Bosnian Serb separatist leaders in [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  the Balkans during the first Trump administration. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=16.32s)]
*  One of those Christian nationalists in attendance was under U.S. sanctions at the time. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=20.12s)]
*  actions Morocco took that violated agency policy. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=25.58s)]
*  One of the journalists behind that investigation, Brett Murphy, joins us now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=30.06s)]
*  Brett, it is great to see you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=34.019999999999996s)]
*  It was a fascinating article because I think a lot of people, when Morocco first started [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=35.66s)]
*  dismantling USAID with rapid speed, wondered who is this guy and what's his backstory, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  and you really fleshed it out, and it is a very unusual backstory. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=49.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=53.699999999999996s)]
*  He was well known to people inside of the State Department, inside of USAID. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=55.22s)]
*  He had worked at both agencies in the previous administration as well as the Pentagon. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=60.78s)]
*  And this episode in the Balkans was really illustrative for a lot of them because they [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=65.94s)]
*  said it was something he did often, leaving the reservation to meet on his own with emissaries [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=70.17999999999999s)]
*  and other officials abroad without speaking with the ambassador first. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=76.24s)]
*  This meeting he had with the Serb separatists was incredibly important because one of the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=81.06s)]
*  people he met with was Milorad Dodik. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=86.10000000000001s)]
*  Milorad Dodik is the president of Republika Srpska, and as you said, he was at the time [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=89.46000000000001s)]
*  under U.S. sanctions. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=94.74000000000001s)]
*  He was under U.S. sanctions by the Trump administrations for undermining the Dayton agreement, which [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=96.58s)]
*  is our critical peace agreement that the U.S. drew up after the genocide in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=102.38s)]
*  So this was really, really important. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=109.86s)]
*  And having that meeting was a big no-no and got him in some hot water at the time. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=112.17999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and you outlined several examples in different countries where U.S. policy said [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  one thing and he went in the other direction, really angering and frustrating both colleagues [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=121.74s)]
*  and officials at USAID. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=129.02s)]
*  The thing that came up a lot in the reporting, and it's come up recently as well, is his [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=132.26s)]
*  nods to Christian nationalism and his questions over what exactly USAID is doing, why USAID [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=138.82s)]
*  exists, why foreign aid exists. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  In a meeting just this week, just this past week, he met with the House Foreign Affairs [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=150.14s)]
*  Committee and these questions came up again. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=155.38s)]
*  He was questioning the constitutionality of foreign aid. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=158.34s)]
*  He brought up the color revolutions and he thought that there may be some criminal activity. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=161.9s)]
*  He was kind of vague about it at the agency that he's been dismantling. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=167.06s)]
*  And these were very alarming comments to some of the lawmakers who were in the meeting because [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=171.46s)]
*  he was, of course, echoing sentiments that have come out of the Kremlin about protests [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=176.5s)]
*  in the Balkans and other parts of the world. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=183.7s)]
*  So this has all been really concerning to a lot of people. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=185.38s)]
*  And that president he met with back in 2018, Milorad Dodik, has said since then that he [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=187.98s)]
*  is pro-Russia, anti-West and anti-U.S. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=194.86s)]
*  So this is all alarming to a lot of people who have been watching him closely for years now. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=198.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, in the article you described his efforts to rapidly disassemble USAID as [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=202.70000000000002s)]
*  almost a personal vendetta against the agency and the people who had criticized him over [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=211.70000000000002s)]
*  the years. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=217.98000000000002s)]
*  Why did you draw that conclusion? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=219.62s)]
*  Yeah, so last time around when he was at USAID, he was frequently trying to conduct reviews [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=221.5s)]
*  of the programming. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=230.1s)]
*  He was getting out in front of the people who were above him. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=231.54000000000002s)]
*  He was crossing lines with people who worked alongside him. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=235.46s)]
*  And what he kept saying he wanted to do was review these programs, review these programs, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=239.10000000000002s)]
*  questioning why they existed at all. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=243.5s)]
*  Something that had a budget item, line item over $10,000 he wanted to personally review. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=246.26s)]
*  And a lot of the people he worked with at the time said this effectively seemed like [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=252.7s)]
*  an effort to halt a lot of these operations on a smaller scale to what we're seeing right [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=257.1s)]
*  now. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=261.58s)]
*  He ran afoul of a lot of the people he worked with, so much so that towards the end of his [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=262.58s)]
*  tenure at USAID last time around, he was kind of on the bench right up until the end of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=268.14s)]
*  the administration. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=272.82s)]
*  So what those folks are saying now, what they're seeing now is sort of an at-scale version [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=274.22s)]
*  of what he was trying to do last time. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=279.54s)]
*  And that is to effectively end all of U.S. foreign aid. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=282.3s)]
*  And they have not made qualms about that's what they're doing right now. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=285.86s)]
*  Right, and he's been pretty effective at it because USAID has been shrunk down to almost [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=289.58000000000004s)]
*  nothing, although there are a lot of lawsuits still pending. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=296.94000000000005s)]
*  Brett Murphy, it's a fascinating article. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=300.38000000000005s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us to talk about it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=302.2s)]
*  Thanks, Nancy. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsbqF2d1Jg&t=304.4s)]
