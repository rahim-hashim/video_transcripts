# Texas and Virginia region covered in snow and sleet
**CBS News:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ)
*  We're also following a winter storm that's affecting parts of the southern U.S. right [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=0.0s)]
*  now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=4.44s)]
*  It's a mix of snow and sleet covering the region stretching from Texas to Virginia. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=5.44s)]
*  Some 53 million Americans were under winter weather alerts Thursday. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=10.0s)]
*  CBS News' Jason Allen is tracking all of that for us from Fort Worth, Texas. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Moderate to sometimes heavy snow coming down in Fort Worth. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=19.8s)]
*  This is the very beginning of a storm that is forecast to drop two inches here and in [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=22.8s)]
*  some places as much as three to four times that. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=27.4s)]
*  In the beginning of this storm, the temperatures have been hovering right about the freezing [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  mark. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  So sometimes it's been snow, sometimes it's going to rain, sleet, and sometimes it's really [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  icy mix. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=40.6s)]
*  What that is leading to here on the surfaces is this really wet, compact snow, right? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=41.6s)]
*  This stuff that really packs together. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=48.68s)]
*  And so what state officials have been saying is their biggest concern for this storm is [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=51.08s)]
*  really out there on the roadways. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=54.8s)]
*  You notice you don't see any signs of plows coming. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=56.84s)]
*  It's because this region really isn't prepared to be able to handle roadways with plows, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  not for this kind of storm. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=64.08s)]
*  They do have some of those available, but they focus on the interstates. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=65.56s)]
*  They focus on those critical roadways and they have been bringing some crews up from [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=69.28s)]
*  the south part of the state to deal with that in those areas that they need to. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  The other big thing and the other big concern of the storm like this is the power grid. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=77.44s)]
*  You will see that the lights are on here in downtown Fort Worth and state officials have [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=81.78s)]
*  been stressing ahead of this storm. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=85.84s)]
*  They expect the lights to stay on. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=87.86s)]
*  The state has really worked hard over the last few years to winterize this grid. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=89.9s)]
*  They have been inspecting some of the power generating facilities last month and this [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=94.74000000000001s)]
*  month to make sure that they are winterized. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  And the state has been stressing to people if the lights go out, if power goes out at [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=101.0s)]
*  some point during this storm, it is more than likely a local issue related to ice or snow [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=104.76s)]
*  that's been gathering on some of the vegetation around lines or accidents that might happen. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=110.64s)]
*  We're only in the beginning hours of this. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=116.48s)]
*  The temperature expected to drop as we get into the overnight hours and snow expected [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  to continue to pile up into Friday. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=123.12s)]
*  Jason Allen for CBS News in Fort Worth. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ThW3O5rMRQ&t=125.88000000000001s)]
