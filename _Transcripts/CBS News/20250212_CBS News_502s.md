# Trump counselor Alina Habba warns of "repercussions" for defying executive orders
**CBS News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU)
*  Welcome back to America Decides. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=0.0s)]
*  We're joined now by Alina Habba, who has an interesting title which gives her some pretty [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=1.84s)]
*  broad scope over the White House. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=6.8s)]
*  Counselor to the President, which is a title that really can be determined by each president [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=8.92s)]
*  as they serve. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=14.08s)]
*  Alina, thanks for being with us. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=15.08s)]
*  I wanted to sort of start by clarifying what it is exactly you're doing for him now, because [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=16.36s)]
*  you were such a well-known spokesperson and attorney and legal adviser over the course [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=23.36s)]
*  of the last several years. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=28.42s)]
*  What is it you're doing for him now? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=30.28s)]
*  Well, a lot of the same. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=31.860000000000003s)]
*  Obviously, I'm not the White House counsel, and it's great that you ask that question. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=33.58s)]
*  Often, my title gets confused with the White House counsel's office. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=37.82s)]
*  I do work as a counterpart with them. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=40.58s)]
*  They're wonderful. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=42.82s)]
*  That's Dave Warrington's office, which is right next to mine. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=43.82s)]
*  But my office is in the West Wing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=46.58s)]
*  I am also an adviser still. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=47.900000000000006s)]
*  I'm clearly still a spokesperson on TV answering questions just on a broader scale. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=49.900000000000006s)]
*  Determining my portfolio, I've been working with things from the Middle East to Tom Homan's [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=55.34s)]
*  group. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=61.06s)]
*  It's been really tremendous, actually. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=62.86s)]
*  It's kind of nice to not be in the courthouse and be able to help the American people. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=64.26s)]
*  What do you know then about Saudi Arabia possibly hosting this meeting for President Trump and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=68.54s)]
*  Russian President Putin? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=72.94s)]
*  I'm not going to speak to that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=74.9s)]
*  You know what I do know is that I'm good enough on TV to know not to answer that question, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=76.02s)]
*  but you can ask me something else. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=79.26s)]
*  Nice try, though. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=80.74000000000001s)]
*  You mentioned the Middle East, so I think you're going to be able to answer that question. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=81.74000000000001s)]
*  So I figured I would try. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=84.82s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=86.14s)]
*  You know, A for effort. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=87.14s)]
*  It was excellent. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=88.14s)]
*  Well, let me ask you about this. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=89.14s)]
*  You know that he's been issuing dozens of executive orders and actions over the last [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=91.5s)]
*  few weeks of the early days of the administration. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=96.14s)]
*  They're obviously being challenged in court in one way or another. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=99.58s)]
*  You had said recently that those that get in the way of the president's executive actions [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=102.61999999999999s)]
*  will face, quote, repercussions. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=105.86s)]
*  What did you mean by that? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=106.86s)]
*  If you looked at Pam Bondi's press conference that was held about five minutes, I think [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=110.41999999999999s)]
*  that's exactly what I meant by that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=114.66s)]
*  Pam Bondi just sued Letitia James, Governor Hockel and the head of the DMV in New York [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=116.78s)]
*  for ignoring a federal mandate. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=120.97999999999999s)]
*  And that's what's going to happen. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=123.58s)]
*  If you defy what is signed and executed and what the American people, frankly, voted for [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=124.58s)]
*  on November 5th, you will get sued. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=130.78s)]
*  You are a state official, federal government. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=133.18s)]
*  There's something called the chain of command. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=135.5s)]
*  And that's exactly what I meant by it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=137.18s)]
*  I would refer you to Pam Bondi's press conference, which was held just moments ago. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=138.7s)]
*  Legal repercussions is one thing. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=144.73999999999998s)]
*  Political repercussions maybe for Republicans who don't fall in line? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  I'm not a politician. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=151.34s)]
*  I speak from, you know, maybe you can't take the lawyer out of me. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=153.18s)]
*  I might be counsel to the president. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=156.94s)]
*  But the way I see it is we have a rule of law. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=158.26s)]
*  You have to follow that rule of law. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=160.66s)]
*  So when I speak, I speak to that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=161.9s)]
*  Anything else, you know, I'll leave that to the Hill and the people out there. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=164.01999999999998s)]
*  But I'm not voted by the constituents. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=166.45999999999998s)]
*  And you know, the reality of the situation is this. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=168.98s)]
*  We had a clear mandate on November 5th, and that was what the American people wanted. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=171.78s)]
*  And to have some of these rogue judges, to have some of these rogue political AGs, I'll [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=176.18s)]
*  call them, or people trying to make a name for them, Governor Hockel coming out with [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=180.5s)]
*  a press conference the day after President Trump was elected, we don't have time for [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=185.02s)]
*  that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=188.78s)]
*  The American people are tired of that rhetoric. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=189.78s)]
*  And I think that's why the Democrats lost on November 5th in such a major way. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=190.78s)]
*  When you call them political judges, let's remind people that they're appointed or nominated [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=195.02s)]
*  to the position by the sitting president. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=199.98s)]
*  There's a guy called... [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=204.17999999999998s)]
*  Not all. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=205.17999999999998s)]
*  Not all. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=206.17999999999998s)]
*  Well, which one? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=207.17999999999998s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=208.17999999999998s)]
*  Well, you have to look at some of the... [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=209.17999999999998s)]
*  Now, you may be talking about executive orders, but listen, unfortunately, and you can talk [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=210.17999999999998s)]
*  about... [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=214.54s)]
*  No, no, no, I was talking about judges. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=215.54s)]
*  I was talking about judges. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=216.54s)]
*  You just said political judges. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=217.54s)]
*  Oh, you don't think that we have judges that are politically motivated. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=218.54s)]
*  I recommend you look at the last three and a half years. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=220.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=223.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=224.62s)]
*  They're all nominated by a president, right? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=226.62s)]
*  Some of them nominated in recent years, obviously, by President Biden, others by President Obama, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=230.16s)]
*  and there are Biden and Obama judges who have weighed in on some of these issues in the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=234.26s)]
*  last few weeks. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=237.42000000000002s)]
*  A handful, though, were nominated by President Trump in his first administration, others [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=238.42000000000002s)]
*  by President Reagan. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=242.86s)]
*  So you're saying there are Democratic and Republican-nominated judges who are being too [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=244.66s)]
*  political at the bench? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=249.38s)]
*  No, that's not what I said. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=251.38s)]
*  I said that there are judges that are political. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=254.02s)]
*  Unfortunately, we've seen judges who have political contributions made, which should [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=256.26s)]
*  not sit on cases that have still sat on cases. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=259.98s)]
*  The fact that you're questioning it is concerning to me. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=263.02000000000004s)]
*  But you're talking about state-level judges that make donations or receive donations [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=265.26s)]
*  or federal ones? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=269.38s)]
*  There are judges that are... [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=270.38s)]
*  Let me be very clear. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=271.38s)]
*  I sued Hillary Clinton. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=272.38s)]
*  Let me give you a little bit of facts. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=273.38s)]
*  Perhaps you're missing that and haven't followed the record for the last three and a half years. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=274.86s)]
*  We sued Hillary Clinton on behalf of President Trump in the Russia hoax, which we now know [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=277.86s)]
*  was a Russia hoax. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=281.34000000000003s)]
*  Judge Middlebrooks, who was a Clinton-appointed judge, never heard the case, never saw the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=282.86s)]
*  case and sanctioned us a million dollars. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=287.26s)]
*  Now tell me that a judge who has never met the lawyers, never spoken to them, had one [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=289.7s)]
*  complaint and then was dismissed but was appointed by the defendant's family. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=293.5s)]
*  Tell me that that doesn't smell fishy. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=298.3s)]
*  So these are things we can't have happen in this country. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=300.5s)]
*  And if you think that the country and the rule of law is perfect, God bless you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=303.82s)]
*  You must sleep well at night. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=307.5s)]
*  But I live in a reality that has been the last three and a half years. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=308.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=312.61999999999995s)]
*  More recently, the judge who ordered the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=313.61999999999995s)]
*  for Disease Control to restore information that had been on their websites, for example, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=321.34s)]
*  nominated by George W. Bush, Elon Musk called him evil and suggested that he should be fired. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=326.97999999999996s)]
*  Is that an argument or an action that you would agree with, that the president would [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=333.53999999999996s)]
*  agree with, that a judge by merely ruling against one of your decisions is evil and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=338.58000000000004s)]
*  should be fired? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=342.3s)]
*  No. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=343.3s)]
*  And I love that you're trying to spin it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=344.3s)]
*  What I'm saying is this. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=346.14000000000004s)]
*  We have executive orders being put in place. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=347.92s)]
*  These judges that are then challenging them, we will deal with them in court. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=350.98s)]
*  I'm not calling a judge evil. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=355.26s)]
*  I'm not disagreeing with anybody else's comments. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=356.70000000000005s)]
*  I'm not Elon Musk's spokesperson. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=359.02000000000004s)]
*  I am literally speaking to one thing. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=360.86s)]
*  by what the American people voted on November 5th. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=364.46s)]
*  And having people try and stop things like Besant from even getting into the Treasury [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=366.9s)]
*  files is absurd. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=374.34s)]
*  And to say that would be anything, anything other than that is insane. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=375.82s)]
*  Look, he was nominated, he was, he was confirmed, and then he couldn't go do his job. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=379.29999999999995s)]
*  That is ridiculous. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=384.62s)]
*  Whatever words you want to use, I leave it to each person. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=386.44s)]
*  That's called the First Amendment right that we still have, I believe. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=388.62s)]
*  But I will say this. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=391.94s)]
*  You have judges who if they wanted to be president, they should have run. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=393.42s)]
*  If they want to oppose things, they should have run. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=397.34s)]
*  Now, if they're doing things based on law or their interpretation of the law, we look [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=399.1s)]
*  forward to fighting that in court the right way and we will do so. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=402.88s)]
*  We will abide it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=405.82s)]
*  We will appeal it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=406.82s)]
*  And we will take it up to the Supreme Court if we need to. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=407.82s)]
*  And then the case involving Besant, the judge took that one back, has fixed it. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=410.54s)]
*  And as you said, it's working its way through the appeals process as are all these cases. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=414.65999999999997s)]
*  And thank you for clarifying that you at least don't believe he should be fired or [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=419.0s)]
*  is evil. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=421.88s)]
*  Well, I didn't say that. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=422.88s)]
*  No, no, don't twist my words. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=424.2s)]
*  I love it. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=425.44s)]
*  You guys are great. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=426.44s)]
*  This is why I don't come on CBS. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=427.44s)]
*  No, I didn't say that. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=428.44s)]
*  What I said is everybody can use whatever words they want. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=429.72s)]
*  But as a lawyer, I'll tell you that we are going to challenge it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=431.92s)]
*  I don't know that judge personally, but I will say this. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=434.48s)]
*  I don't care what you're doing. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=437.72s)]
*  If you're trying to stop people who were appointed, confirmed by the American people from doing [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=439.48s)]
*  their job, that is not following the American way. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=444.14s)]
*  It's unconstitutional. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  There are things called separation of powers. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=449.96000000000004s)]
*  There is the executive branch, there's the judicial branch. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=450.96000000000004s)]
*  But if you want to tell me that we do not have a problem in our judicial system after [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=453.08000000000004s)]

*  happening even though they will lose federal fundings as a hospital, then maybe we should [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=462.64000000000004s)]
*  be on a different program. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=466.84000000000003s)]
*  But thank you very much. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=468.16s)]
*  I appreciate you being here and answering those questions. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=471.24s)]
*  I wasn't the one raising concerns about judges, but I can appreciate the concerns that the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=474.56s)]
*  Trump administration has. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=480.2s)]
*  I definitely have them. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgU0sV9-bUU&t=481.2s)]
