# What Americans want to hear from Trump's address to Congress
**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI)
*  We're learning more about what Americans want to hear from President Trump tonight in his address to Congress. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=0.0s)]
*  A new CBS News poll finds the economy, not surprisingly, as uppermost on people's minds. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=5.28s)]
*  CBS News elections and surveys executive director, your friend and mine, Anthony Salvanto, joins me now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=10.72s)]
*  Anthony, break it down. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=16.88s)]
*  Hey there, Major. Yeah, I try sometimes to have surprises, but sometimes it's just... [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=18.0s)]
*  I display my firm grasp of the obvious, right? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=23.44s)]
*  It's lowering prices that people say is the top thing when we gave them a list of what they want to hear about. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=26.32s)]
*  And as you said at the top, this has been the top issue for them. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=33.36s)]
*  People have said their incomes are not keeping up with inflation. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=37.84s)]
*  They have said that prices is the number one reason they don't think the economy is good. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=40.8s)]
*  But there's also this, and it really speaks to the political moment here. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=45.2s)]
*  Yes, the economy and inflation are the top things they think should be the high priorities [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=50.0s)]
*  for the Trump administration. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=55.28s)]
*  But I'm going to put that side by side with what they think are the top priorities when it comes to economy and inflation. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=56.72s)]
*  And those numbers are very, very different. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=65.6s)]
*  In other words, they don't think the administration is prioritizing the economy and inflation enough. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=67.92s)]
*  And that's a gap we're going to watch to see if the president can close tonight. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=73.6s)]
*  Anthony, one of the data drivers during the campaign was immigration. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=77.76s)]
*  What do we see there? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=81.12s)]
*  One of the things that I'm sure the president will talk about tonight, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=83.19999999999999s)]
*  because he is getting positive approval on it, is handling immigration. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=85.92s)]
*  And specifically, this big number that believes that his policies are making the number of migrants attempting to cross the border go down. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=90.56s)]
*  So that's one of those things in any address to Congress. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=99.91999999999999s)]
*  You expect the president, any president, to try to tout their accomplishments. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  And that in the data certainly seems to be one of them he'll point to. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  The best there is, Anthony Salvanto. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=111.92s)]
*  Thank you, my friend. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KH7LC0mbwI&t=114.0s)]
