# Almost all of USAID staff expected to be laid off
**CBS News:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc)
*  OK, turning now to those massive cuts to USAID, as nearly all of the agency is expected to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=0.0s)]
*  be laid off today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=5.28s)]
*  Reuters reports the agency will retain just over 600 workers, which is down from the thousands [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  that it had. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=11.82s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News White House reporter Aaron Navarro. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=12.82s)]
*  Aaron, unions representing USAID, as you know, have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=16.92s)]
*  What are they arguing? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=23.32s)]
*  Good morning, Vlad. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=24.48s)]
*  This lawsuit filed last night against President Trump, as well as Secretary of State Marco [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=25.84s)]
*  Rubio, argues that the White House's actions to dismantle USAID in the past couple of weeks [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=29.64s)]
*  oversteps the role of Congress, who established USAID as an independent agency in 1998. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=34.72s)]
*  Just a reminder of some of the actions they've taken on USAID. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=40.32s)]
*  An overall freeze on foreign aid, a stop work order, a cut down of an agency of about 14,000 [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  staff to an expected 294 instead. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=49.28s)]
*  The lawsuit last night says that none of these actions got authorization from Congress and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=53.06s)]
*  says Congress can be the only entity that can lawfully dismantle this agency. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=57.84s)]
*  They are looking for a temporary restraining order and the impending move tonight for all [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=62.68000000000001s)]
*  direct hire personnel to be put on administrative leave and any further actions. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=66.72s)]
*  It also looks to restore the agency's funding for foreign aid as well as reopen its offices. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=71.76s)]
*  And just this morning, Trump posted on True Social, quote, USAID is driving the radical [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=76.36s)]
*  left crazy and there's nothing they can do about it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=81.16s)]
*  So, Aaron, another federal judge has blocked President Trump's attempt at ending birthright [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=84.74s)]
*  citizenship. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=94.46s)]
*  Tell me about that and how the White House is responding. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=95.66s)]
*  Yeah, also last night the White House's, or the Department of Justice, filed their [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=97.86s)]
*  first appeal against this block in Washington and they continue their argument that those [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=102.78s)]
*  in the U.S. illegally are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, kind of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=107.28s)]
*  looking at that 14th Amendment language. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=110.97999999999999s)]
*  And therefore, their children are not U.S. citizens. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=113.6s)]
*  They're looking to kick that case up to the Circuit Court of Appeals out in the West [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=116.36s)]
*  Coast, but certainly one of the many things that they're going to have to respond to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=121.82s)]
*  in terms of litigation in the next couple weeks. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  All right, Aaron Navarro for us this morning. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=128.68s)]
*  Aaron, thank you very much. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRYio82Mpc&t=131.16s)]
