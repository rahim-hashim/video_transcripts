# Remembering visionary filmmaker David Lynch
**CBS News:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE)
*  We're following breaking news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=0.0s)]
*  American filmmaker David Lynch has died, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=1.84s)]
*  according to a family statement. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=4.0s)]
*  The 78-year-old is best known for directing [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=5.72s)]
*  avant-garde films like Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  as well as the TV show Twin Peaks. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=10.36s)]
*  The cause of death is unclear, but Lynch suffered [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=12.5s)]
*  from emphysema toward the end of his life. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=14.46s)]
*  Jamie Wax joins me in studio 57 for more. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=16.56s)]
*  So Jamie, give us a history about David Lynch [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=18.76s)]
*  and how he got his start in his career. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=20.68s)]
*  Gosh, what an influential filmmaker. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=22.0s)]
*  I mean, a filmmaker's filmmaker, I would say. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=24.2s)]
*  He started making short films in his youth, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=27.36s)]
*  and then many people don't know his career in Hollywood [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=30.32s)]
*  really took off in 1977 with the very unusual [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=33.12s)]
*  cult classic Eraserhead, which was seen by Mel Brooks [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=37.2s)]
*  of all people, and Mel Brooks hired him [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=40.6s)]
*  to direct The Elephant Man, which was the source [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=43.44s)]
*  of his first Oscar nomination. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  A brilliant film, brilliant adaptation, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=48.32s)]
*  and set the tone for the sort of moody, odd narrative [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=50.620000000000005s)]
*  traditionally thrown out the door and making way [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=54.92s)]
*  for something far more disorienting and interesting [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  than he did his whole career. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  And how did he stay true to himself, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  which was sort of zen-like? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=64.2s)]
*  He was one of the first promoters and practitioners [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=65.64s)]
*  of transcendental meditation while creating [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=67.48s)]
*  sort of these chaotic worlds and finding Hollywood success. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=69.64s)]
*  It's true, I mean, I think all creative people [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=72.4s)]
*  are dichotomies on some level. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=74.28s)]
*  He certainly was, he was this elegant, straight-laced guy [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=75.66s)]
*  who made very, as you say, chaotic oftentimes, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=78.92s)]
*  and unusual stories, bizarre, disturbing. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=82.2s)]
*  I say watching a Lynch movie is like when you're a kid [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=86.48s)]
*  and you spin around for fun. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=88.76s)]
*  Part of the fun is being disoriented, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=90.62s)]
*  and that is true of David Lynch's work as well. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=92.76s)]
*  But he did operate within the Hollywood system. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=95.68s)]
*  He did very well on television, he did very well [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=98.28s)]
*  working with studios and creating films, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  but he also had his big commercial misses [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=103.88s)]
*  that always had something creative and artistic [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=106.82000000000001s)]
*  for people to love. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=109.04s)]
*  How was he able to find his footing [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=109.88s)]
*  in both television and film? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=111.4s)]
*  It's an interesting thing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=112.72s)]
*  There are times when he created something as a film [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=113.64s)]
*  and people looked at it and said, no way. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=116.64s)]
*  So he brought it to TV, and vice versa. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=119.04s)]
*  He has TV projects he brought to film. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=121.72s)]
*  I think he just had a style, and I have to suspect, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=124.48s)]
*  looking at his body of work, I think he was probably [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=128.08s)]
*  incapable of not being authentic in his storytelling, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=130.36s)]
*  and somehow he came along at the right moment [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=134.24s)]
*  to find an audience for decades. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=136.52s)]
*  You say that he was one of the ones evacuated [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=138.24s)]
*  to the wildfires. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=141.72s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=142.56s)]
*  Well, I mean, he had emphysema. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=143.38s)]
*  His family has said that it was traumatic for him [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=144.44s)]
*  to be evacuated from a Southern California home, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=146.88s)]
*  and we're talking about a matter of days ago, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=149.68s)]
*  and now we've lost him. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  And you know, you think about this. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=153.72s)]
*  In 2019, the Academy gave him an honorary Oscar. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=155.34s)]
*  I think that's a statement from his fellow filmmakers [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  that he would never win in a traditional way. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=163.44s)]
*  He was too original and too unusual, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=166.4s)]
*  but that had to be one of the honors of his life, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=169.04s)]
*  because that was from his peers. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=171.32s)]
*  Jamie Wax, thank you, as always. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=173.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaJjOhFcE&t=174.76s)]
