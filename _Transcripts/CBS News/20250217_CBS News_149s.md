*  Four deputy mayors gave notice that it was no longer tenable to continue to work for him, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=36.3s)]
*  as the controversy continued to grow over the possibility he agreed to acquit pro quo [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=41.0s)]
*  to get his criminal case dropped. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=45.9s)]

*  Due to the extraordinary events of the last few weeks and to stay faithful to the oath [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=62.5s)]
*  we swore to New Yorkers and our families, we have come to the difficult decision to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=66.4s)]
*  step down from our roles. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=70.6s)]
*  Asked about it, the mayor pointed to the fact that he had weathered other departures, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=72.3s)]

*  When I was indicted, you all remember what happened. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  People departed. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  When I was indicted, people said that's the end of the administration. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=90.30000000000001s)]
*  People said that, you know, people have lost confidence. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=94.4s)]
*  And go back and do an analysis from the day that I was indicted to what we have accomplished. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=97.7s)]
*  That is my ability to lead through turmoil and I'm going to continue to do that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=103.30000000000001s)]
*  In a statement, Adams said he was disappointed, adding, quote, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=108.6s)]
*  Let me be crystal clear. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=111.9s)]
*  New York City will keep moving forward just as it does every day. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=113.6s)]
*  During the campaign rally, Adams described himself as a man who didn't break despite [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=117.2s)]
*  his many travails. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=120.9s)]
*  He didn't break when he was a young boy in a police department being beat. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=122.6s)]
*  He didn't break when someone shot out his car windows. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=128.1s)]
*  He didn't break when they wanted to fire him after 22 years for standing up and fighting for you. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=131.1s)]
*  He didn't break when they indicted him. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=136.1s)]
*  He didn't break. He didn't break. He didn't break. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=138.7s)]
*  Because the reason I'm not going to break, because I need to fight for you. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=141.4s)]
*  Marshall Cramer reporting. Thank you. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ylgaUhKXc&t=145.4s)]
