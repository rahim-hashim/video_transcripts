# Trump warns Putin to end war in Ukraine or face sanctions and tariffs
**CBS News:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34)
*  President Trump has warned Vladimir Putin that he'll impose tariffs and more sanctions [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=0.0s)]
*  on Russia if it does not reach an agreement to end the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=4.4s)]
*  In a post to True Social yesterday, Trump urged Putin to quote, settle now and stop [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=8.42s)]
*  this ridiculous war, or he'll put high levels of taxes, tariffs and sanctions on items sold [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=12.46s)]
*  by Russia. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=18.42s)]
*  Joining us now from the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv is CBS News senior foreign correspondent [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=19.42s)]
*  Holly Williams. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=24.42s)]
*  Holly, these kinds of threats. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=25.94s)]
*  Are they likely to bring Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=28.98s)]
*  Good morning, Vlad. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=35.980000000000004s)]
*  Well, interestingly, the Kremlin's actually already responded to that post from President [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=36.980000000000004s)]
*  Trump saying that it's quote, nothing new. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=40.86s)]
*  And that's probably not very surprising given that Russia is already isolated economically [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  and politically from the West by existing sanctions. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=48.78s)]
*  Look, here I think is the bigger picture. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=52.2s)]
*  On the one hand, Russia is currently making gains on the battlefield here in Ukraine. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=54.62s)]
*  But on the other, a lot of military observers believe that this war has been a humiliation [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=59.98s)]
*  for Vladimir Putin, a war that he started by invading Ukraine. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=65.7s)]
*  So Russia has suffered a string of embarrassing failures here on the battlefield. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=70.5s)]
*  The second or third most powerful military in the world, supposedly, has only succeeded [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=74.9s)]
*  in taking 20, around 20 percent of Ukraine's territory. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  And Russia has suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=83.9s)]
*  So yes, maybe at this point, Vladimir Putin would be super willing to sit down with the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=87.22s)]
*  president of the United States at a summit meeting and find a face saving way out of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=92.2s)]
*  this conflict. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=97.36000000000001s)]
*  Here in Ukraine, more and more people are open to negotiations, open to a ceasefire. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=98.72s)]
*  But the fear is that Vladimir Putin could use negotiations, use a ceasefire to buy time, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=104.08s)]
*  rebuild his military and then renege on any deal and reinvade Ukraine. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=110.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=116.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=117.2s)]
*  So speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, as you know, Holly, Ukraine's [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=118.2s)]
*  president, Vladimir Zelensky, said at least 200,000 European peacekeepers would be needed [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=122.88s)]
*  to stop new Russian attacks under any ceasefire deal that the two come to an agreement over. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=127.4s)]
*  What more can you tell us about what else Ukraine is saying that it needs? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, look, Vlad, there was a recent poll here in Ukraine that just found that just [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  over half of Ukrainians would like to negotiate a ceasefire. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  That is up dramatically since the beginning of the war in 2022. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=149.16s)]
*  And it's not surprising given the horrors that people have lived through here over the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=153.42s)]
*  last three years or so. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=157.57999999999998s)]
*  But Ukraine is adamant that there cannot be a ceasefire without security guarantees for [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  Ukraine, whether that is NATO membership, whereby the US and other countries would have [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=165.29999999999998s)]
*  to come to Ukraine's defense if it was attacked, whether it's peacekeepers or some other measures. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=169.29999999999998s)]
*  Also, many Ukrainians have said to us that no matter what happens, they need a continuing [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=174.94s)]
*  supply of American weapons to defend themselves because they do not trust Vladimir Putin to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=180.68s)]
*  stick to any deal that he agrees to. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=186.84s)]
*  So look, at least some Ukrainians would like to negotiate, would like a ceasefire, but [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=190.12s)]
*  the devil is going to be in the details. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=194.52s)]
*  Vlad. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=197.24s)]
*  All right, Holly Williams for us from Kyiv this morning. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=198.24s)]
*  Thank you, Holly. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYeErvQb34&t=201.08s)]
