# What we know about investigation into midair D.C. plane crash
**CBS News:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE)
*  The big story we're following, the mid-air collision outside of Washington, D.C. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=0.0s)]
*  Search and recovery efforts resumed this morning to find the missing victims. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=5.0s)]
*  The National Transportation Safety Board says it has now found key clues in its investigation. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=9.64s)]
*  The plane, with 64 people on board, collided with an Army helicopter carrying three soldiers [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  early Wednesday. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=21.76s)]
*  First responders have now recovered at least 40 bodies. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=23.26s)]
*  Experts say they believe no one survived the accident. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=27.28s)]
*  Divers were able to recover the plane's black boxes, and the NTSB is now analyzing them. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=30.32s)]
*  CBS News senior transportation correspondent Chris Van Cleave joins us now from Washington [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=36.72s)]
*  with more on this story. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=41.64s)]
*  Chris, the NTSB says they found those black boxes now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=42.88s)]
*  So what kind of data may investigators be able to retrieve? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=46.88s)]
*  Well, there is a voice recorder and a data recorder. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=50.52s)]
*  The data recorder records thousands of pieces of data about how the airplane was operating [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=55.16s)]
*  during that flight, leading up to this mid-air collision. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  So it will give investigators a host of data points as to what was going on mechanically [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=68.16s)]
*  with the airplane, how it was operating, the speed it was traveling, the height, the altitude. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=76.08s)]
*  That's going to be an important point. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=82.28s)]
*  They should get almost a literal mountain of data out of that data recorder that they [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  will need to analyze to thoroughly understand, even if they may start getting some initial [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=90.89999999999999s)]
*  data from that right away. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=97.3s)]
*  The voice recorder, well, that has to be transcribed. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=99.3s)]
*  There's a very laborious process that goes into how they transcribe and read out that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=102.69999999999999s)]
*  voice recorder. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=112.18s)]
*  That will take some time before investigators have a final transcript there. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=113.18s)]
*  But that should document the conversation inside the cockpit. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=117.94000000000001s)]
*  What were the pilots talking about? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=121.62s)]
*  What were they seeing? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=122.86000000000001s)]
*  Were they aware of this helicopter? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=123.94000000000001s)]
*  What was going on in those final moments? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=126.06s)]
*  And Chris, Reagan National Airport is now we know one of three capacity-constrained airports [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=128.70000000000002s)]
*  in the country. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=133.9s)]
*  How may that have played a role in this crash? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=135.10000000000002s)]
*  Well, it may or may not have. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=138.3s)]
*  And that's certainly something investigators will look at here is just the volume of traffic [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=141.9s)]
*  coming in and out of Washington, Reagan Airport. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=146.82s)]
*  Basically, capacity-controlled or slot-controlled means the FAA has determined that a certain [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=150.66s)]
*  number of flights can take off and land from this airport a day. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=155.66s)]
*  That's capacity. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=159.42000000000002s)]
*  They only allow that many flights. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=160.42000000000002s)]
*  They're pre-assigned to the airlines. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=161.98000000000002s)]
*  The airlines own those slots and they operate them. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=163.34s)]
*  may or may not be significant here, but Reagan is one of those handful of airports where [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=168.98s)]
*  the FAA has said this is what capacity is and you can't go over it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=174.66s)]
*  There's also been, Chris, a lot of talk about staffing levels at the air traffic control [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=178.66s)]
*  tower. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=183.17999999999998s)]
*  What can you tell us about that? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=184.17999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think what's raising some eyebrows is this report that staffing was, quote, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=186.22s)]
*  normal in the Washington, Reagan tower at the time of this incident. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=195.58s)]
*  That does not mean that there weren't people in it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=201.10000000000002s)]
*  There were. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=203.9s)]
*  Sources tell us that the staffing level was deemed adequate. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=204.9s)]
*  In fact, if staffing drops below a certain point, it activates a trigger, which is the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=208.3s)]
*  word the FAA uses, a trigger that could, for example, impact the number of planes coming [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=213.74s)]
*  and going from this airport. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=219.34s)]
*  No trigger was activated. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=221.18s)]
*  But the FAA controller that was managing helicopter traffic was also managing some planes taking [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=223.66s)]
*  off and landing. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=232.61999999999998s)]
*  That is typically, at that time of day, two jobs, not one. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=233.61999999999998s)]
*  We also understand a second controller was also doing two jobs, not one. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=237.94s)]
*  So two people doing the jobs of four around the time of this accident. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=242.14s)]
*  That is something the NTSB will look at. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=246.33999999999997s)]
*  necessarily mean that was a factor, but it doesn't mean it wasn't. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=248.58s)]
*  And understanding the workload and the communication coming out of the tower, that will be both [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=253.9s)]
*  of those will be key parts of this investigation for sure. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=260.58000000000004s)]
*  OK, some important contacts there. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=263.3s)]
*  Chris Van Cleve, thank you. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqDw4pg_JtE&t=265.06s)]
