# Pope Francis remains hospitalized, shows signs of improvement
**CBS News:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8)
*  Now we want to get in the latest on Pope Francis's health battle. Thousands of people gathered [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8&t=0.0s)]
*  in St. Peter's Square last night to pray for the pontiff. The Vatican says he slept well at night [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8&t=5.2s)]
*  and is showing a slight improvement as he continues oxygen therapy. CBS News foreign [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8&t=11.36s)]
*  correspondent Chris Livesey joins us with more from Rome with more on this with the Vatican there in [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8&t=16.8s)]
*  the background. Chris bring us up to speed on the Pope's condition. I know that they give updates [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8&t=22.16s)]
*  at around this time usually. That's right, Errol. You know, we heard just recently that [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8&t=27.2s)]
*  Pope Francis slept well during the night and that he's able to get up out of bed. And as you mentioned, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8&t=34.08s)]
*  there was a slight improvement that was reported last night. So all these are encouraging signs, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8&t=40.0s)]
*  but the Vatican is clear to point out that he is not out of the woods. His condition remains [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8&t=45.92s)]
*  critical. He is after all an 88 year old man who with a series of hospital stays just in the last [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8&t=52.559999999999995s)]
*  four years alone. One previously was already for pneumonia. This time it's double pneumonia, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  pneumonia in both of his lungs. He only has one and a half lungs because a portion of his lung [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8&t=64.56s)]
*  was removed when he was a young man. So it's still very serious. As you mentioned at the start of the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8&t=68.96s)]
*  of our of our talk, he we have parishioners, the faithful who have been flooding into St. Peter's [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8&t=75.28s)]
*  Square behind me. Starting last night, the Vatican started holding the rosary recitation [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8&t=81.28s)]
*  and it's going to continue to do that for the foreseeable future. Now, Pope Francis was [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8&t=89.44s)]
*  supposed to stay in the hospital regardless for at least another week just to get some rest because [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8&t=96.16s)]
*  he leads such a punishing work ethic. That was before we had heard over the weekend this turn [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8&t=101.92s)]
*  for the worst when he needed to have high flow oxygen, blood transfusions when he suffered an [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8&t=107.76s)]
*  asthma attack or what the Vatican described as a prolonged respiratory crisis. They say that that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8&t=114.48s)]
*  was the only time it happened. He's showing slight improvements. He doesn't need as much high flow [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  oxygen as he did before, but again the condition of Pope Francis remains critical. Arrol. Yeah, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8&t=127.12s)]
*  at the very least there seemed to be some encouraging updates. Chris, thank you for that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8VfR4mF0W8&t=133.68s)]
