# Details on judge's pause of Trump's federal worker "buyout" proposal
**CBS News:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY)
*  We begin this morning with a setback for President Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=0.0s)]
*  A federal judge has temporarily blocked the deadline for federal employees to accept his [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=3.74s)]
*  administration's proposed buyout offer until at least Monday. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=9.58s)]
*  Now this offer was not approved by Congress and unions are warning workers not to take [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=13.82s)]
*  the deal. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=18.28s)]
*  In a statement, the Office of Personnel Management says the government will honor the deferred [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=19.28s)]
*  resignation offer. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=24.04s)]
*  What does this all really mean? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=25.66s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Natalie Brand joins us from the White House with more on this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=26.94s)]
*  And Natalie, I would imagine it may cause some stress and confusion among federal employees, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=30.94s)]
*  but help us understand how the White House is responding to this judge's ruling. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=35.46s)]
*  Good morning, Errol. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=40.260000000000005s)]
*  Well, for now, everything is paused. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=41.260000000000005s)]
*  So the administration says that their deadline for employees to make this decision will also [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=43.22s)]
*  be postponed until later on Monday. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=48.7s)]
*  But that's when this case is back in court and the judge who made that initial decision, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=52.0s)]
*  Judge O'Toole, to pause this deadline will have to decide whether he's going to extend [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=57.72s)]
*  his pause or make a more permanent ruling. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=64.0s)]
*  So this is going to play out in a courtroom. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=67.6s)]
*  But yesterday I spoke to the policy director of one of the unions representing federal [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=69.48s)]
*  workers, the American Federation of Government Employees, and she said their big concern [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=74.92s)]
*  that the Trump administration does not have the authority to make this kind of offer, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=80.36s)]
*  this buyout for federal workers. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=85.64s)]
*  And they're also concerned that the administration may not fulfill the terms of what they're [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=88.94000000000001s)]
*  offering, paying out the employees through the end of September. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=94.76s)]
*  So everyone assessing closely, assessing this deal, and ultimately it rests in the courtroom [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=99.84s)]
*  of that judge. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  It'll be a confusing weekend for so many people. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  I also want to ask you about the Trump administration's plan to lay off, I think, nearly all of USAID's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=109.2s)]
*  employees by the end of the day today. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=115.72s)]
*  What is the actual scale of that and what change might it make to their missions abroad? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=118.56s)]
*  Yeah, CBS News has learned that a list circulating within USAID shows that fewer than 300 employees [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=124.48s)]
*  are deemed essential. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=133.16s)]
*  out of more than 10,000 who are facing leave. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  Keep in mind, Errol, that this is an agency that provides humanitarian aid, assistance [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  to dozens of countries around the world. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  That's everything from healthcare, monitoring disease outbreaks, fighting disease, also [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=147.12s)]
*  promoting democracy. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=154.12s)]
*  So there's a lot of concern internationally about this, all the turmoil at USAID right [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=155.56s)]
*  now. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=162.28s)]
*  The acting administrator of USAID, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, he addressed some of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=163.32s)]
*  the concerns and said, we're going to continue to provide foreign aid. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=169.64000000000001s)]
*  It just has to be programs that we can justify, alluding to programs that align with the administration's [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=173.88s)]
*  priorities. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=180.84s)]
*  Well, CBS News asked Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who sits on the Senate Foreign [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=181.84s)]
*  Relations Committee, whether that comment reassures him at all. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=187.04s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=190.48s)]
*  It's not. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=192.76s)]
*  And here's why. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=193.76s)]
*  It's become pretty clear that Marco Rubio, Secretary Rubio, is not in charge of the operations [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=195.2s)]
*  at AID. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=202.67999999999998s)]
*  Elon Musk is in charge of the operations over AID. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  And it was Elon Musk who tweeted out the other day that he was putting AID through the woodchipper. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=209.64s)]
*  He said he was going to kill AID. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=216.68s)]
*  Well, late last night, unions representing some of the federal employees of USAID, they [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  filed a lawsuit saying that this move by the administration is unconstitutional to try [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=227.08s)]
*  to dismantle USAID without congressional input. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=232.8s)]
*  They also say this is creating a crisis, will lead to instability globally, and really raising [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=236.52s)]
*  a lot of concerns. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=244.16000000000003s)]
*  So again, Errol, this is all developing. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=245.64s)]
*  Another lawsuit, another day. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=249.04s)]
*  We'll have to wait and see how this challenge plays out. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=250.72s)]
*  Alright, Natalie Brand, thank you for that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGWIu05QZY&t=253.48s)]
