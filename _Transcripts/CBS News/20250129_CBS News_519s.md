# Hawaii Gov. Josh Green makes case against RFK Jr. for health secretary
**CBS News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80)
*  I want to make sure the committee is clear about a few things. News reports have claimed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=0.0s)]
*  that I am anti-vaccine or anti-industry. I am neither. I am pro-safety. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=5.28s)]
*  A contentious hearing today. The president's pick to lead Health and Human Services, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=11.8s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., making his case on Capitol Hill. But as lawmakers consider his [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=16.6s)]
*  nomination, Hawaii's Democratic Governor Josh Green has a message for them, arguing that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=20.72s)]
*  his confirmation, Kennedy's confirmation, in his view, could have deadly consequences. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=25.32s)]
*  But Governor Josh Green is here on set with us now. Governor, thanks for being here. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=29.8s)]
*  Let's play a clip of Carolyn Kennedy, the daughter of President John F. Kennedy, speaking [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=34.24s)]
*  about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=40.04s)]
*  GOVERNOR CAROLYN KENNEDY, HOST,channel 9 of The Washington Post, The Washington Post [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=42.72s)]
*  Newsweek. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=44.72s)]
*  Bobby is addicted to attention and power. Bobby preys on the desperation of parents of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=46.72s)]
*  sick children, vaccinating his own kids, while building a following hypocritically [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=49.2s)]
*  discouraging other parents from vaccinating theirs. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=54.56s)]
*  So, Governor, you have a member of the Kennedy family, an esteemed ambassador, daughter of a [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=58.04s)]
*  president, criticizing Robert F. Kennedy Jr. You have Democratic senators today doing the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=63.36s)]
*  same. You have Robert F. Kennedy Jr., though, saying today that he is not anti-vaccine. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=68.36s)]
*  He was making different statements throughout his testimony today about how he couches his [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=73.48s)]
*  position in terms of mandates for vaccines and how his position, in his view, is a bit [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=78.44s)]
*  varied when it comes to the exact nature of how he looks at this issue. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=84.0s)]
*  As someone who governs a state, someone who has to deal with real-world problems, real-world [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=89.0s)]
*  health issues, what did you make of his testimony today? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  It was nonsense. I mean, I don't want to be too cruel. I respect the person and the family, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  but I've had interactions kind of cross paths with R.F.K. Jr., and it's not true. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=104.96s)]
*  First of all, I'm a physician, okay, and the only physician that's a governor. And what [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=112.96s)]
*  happened in Samoa was relevant. There's 40,000 Samoans who live in Hawaii. That nation is [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=117.55999999999999s)]
*  close to Hawaii. They had the measles outbreak five years ago. He rolled through that nation [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=122.72s)]
*  and scared them, discouraged them, talked to their prime minister. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=128.4s)]
*  I know that because I went in to clean up the mess. I took the medical mission into Samoa, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=131.28s)]
*  75 doctors and nurses, and we vaccinated 37,000 people after there had been many deaths. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=135.92s)]
*  Ultimately, 83 deaths. And he did scare them. They told me personally that he basically had [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=142.48s)]
*  come in and wanted to do this kind of experiment to see what would happen naturally if you just [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  let this virus and measles virus's very contagious roll through. And you also had 5,000 people get [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  sick and they get encephalopathy, which is swelling of the brain. They can get blindness [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=160.56s)]
*  or deafness from the virus. So he did that. And then he came and told the Congress, no, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=165.12s)]
*  I'm not anti-vax. Well, he is. He founded an organization that is anti-vax. He got paid [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=171.12s)]
*  millions of dollars by that organization to kind of go and spin that gospel. So he may not be [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=176.64s)]
*  specifically telling people, don't get this vaccine, but he's sowing doubt. And when you sow doubt, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  the vaccine rates drop and then you get lots of spread because you don't have herd immunity. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=188.72s)]
*  That's what he did in Samoa. So that was a dishonest hearing. I don't know what to tell you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=193.12s)]
*  People in Washington seem to like play the partisan thing, but this is going to kill kids. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=199.04s)]
*  COSTA Let's listen to what Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had to say to our CBS colleague, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=203.12s)]
*  Major Garrett, in the past year on this issue. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  GARRETT I had nothing to do with it. And if you actually looked at what happened in Samoa, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=211.04s)]
*  the people who died were dying not from measles but almost certainly from the defective vaccine [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=218.88s)]
*  that was brought in from Australia and then given to children who were already sick, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=224.16s)]
*  which you should never do. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  COSTA That was right before he dropped out of the presidential race. What's your response to how he's [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=231.12s)]
*  approaching this? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=236.96s)]
*  BENNETT Well, he's not taking any responsibility. We have footage from his own feeds, his own social [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=237.68s)]
*  media, from other people's feeds, that he was there yucking it up, smiling, laughing with the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=243.12s)]
*  prime minister. He did do that. He did go in there and discourage people. And it just takes a [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=248.48s)]
*  nudge for people who are vaccine hesitant. And then he spread misinformation. What really happened, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  what really happened was two children died because they were given the wrong reagent, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=259.12s)]
*  which was a tragedy, human error. Those two nurses were prosecuted and sentenced. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=263.28s)]
*  Then he went in and told people, and he said it again, by the way, today in the hearing. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=267.84s)]
*  I hope you'll be able to roll footage in the coming days. He said today the measles vaccine [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  killed those two children. That's not true. The measles reagent killed them. The vaccine was fine. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=276.24s)]
*  And then we used these vaccines to vaccinate 37,000 people in two days, and the measles stopped. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  So he's telling lie after lie, misinformation after misinformation. And this is the person [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=289.36s)]
*  who, with no experience, no training, will be in charge of the Health and Human Services Department, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  which is huge, $1.7 trillion. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=300.16s)]
*  So his nomination is still very much to be determined. But let's say Mr. Kennedy is [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=303.76s)]
*  confirmed by this Republican controlled Senate. Will you work with HHS and a potential Secretary [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  Kennedy on policy? Well, I'm going to vaccinate people. I had to deal with that, of course, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=315.36s)]
*  in the last administration when people were allowing misinformation about the COVID vaccine, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=320.32s)]
*  and I had to continuously press for the vaccine. Of course, I will work with everyone. I actually [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=325.36s)]
*  worked at HHS. I was a National Health Service Corps scholar, a physician that was sent to Hawaii [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=330.08s)]
*  to provide health care. So, of course, I will work with anybody, but it's not good to nominate [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=335.44s)]
*  people that have no experience in their discipline, and it's not good to put someone in there who will, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=341.28s)]
*  you know, misrepresent. This is a guy who was getting paid, and everyone knows it, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=346.24s)]
*  everyone knows it, to thwart vaccination programs. He admitted it today that he was paid by these [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=350.08s)]
*  guys and still wants to get paid. We have all the footage, so I don't know how anyone with a [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=356.48s)]
*  straight face can say it. He created an organization called the Children's Health Defense, which is a [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  pure anti-vax group. They're selling onesies, as Bernie pointed out, that says, don't vaccinate me [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=366.64000000000004s)]
*  or something. This is an organization he founded. So has the world gone mad that we are going to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=372.0s)]
*  suggest that this guy is actually okay with vaccinations? He will again place doubt into [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=378.16s)]
*  the field, and then we will see outbreaks. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=384.24s)]
*  COSTA finally here, Governor. The Democratic Party, your party in the political wilderness, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=386.32s)]
*  not controlling the House, the Senate, or the White House. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=391.76s)]
*  Jimmy Carter, former president of the United States and outsider, came out of nowhere in 1976. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=395.2s)]
*  A lot of people in Washington are wondering, come 2028, could it be another outsider who emerges [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=400.08s)]
*  this time around, decades later, to give the Democratic Party a new voice? You're a physician, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=405.68s)]
*  a governor, someone who's probably as far away as you can get from Washington, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=411.44s)]
*  D.C., though maybe the Alaskan governor would have a bit of an argument there as well. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=415.52s)]
*  Are you considering it all a presidential conversation for yourself in the coming years? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=420.4s)]
*  I mean, that's incredibly flattering. I'm proud to be a doctor and a governor. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=426.96s)]
*  It seems highly unlikely. I'm going to be governor through 26, and if the people have me through 2030, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=431.36s)]
*  you'd have to really convince my wife, frankly, to do anything like that. But I will always help [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=437.52000000000004s)]
*  the people here in D.C. And you never know how the world will turn, but I really am honored to be [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=442.24s)]
*  governor of Hawaii because geopolitically we're actually a lot more central to what the nation [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=447.44s)]
*  does. We handle the Pacific region. We will deal with what comes out of Taiwan and China's conflicts. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  And as you can see, everyone loves Hawaii. We've even had to deal with some of the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=458.0s)]
*  largest crises, and we're helping people that are in other states that are dealing with wildfires now [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=461.76s)]
*  and so on. So look, it's an honor that you would say something like that. But you're a governor of [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=466.16s)]
*  a key state that has to deal with a lot of different issues. It's not trying to honor you [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=472.16s)]
*  in any way, but this is a party that clearly has no evident standard bearer at this point. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=476.32000000000005s)]
*  And you're a sitting governor in a party that doesn't have many sitting governors. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=482.48s)]
*  What I'll do is I will help us lead, and I'll help the whole country lead. I'm afforded a really [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=486.64000000000004s)]
*  special honor, which is that it's very nonpartisan for me as the governor of Hawaii. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=492.16s)]
*  So a lot of Democrats support me, and a ton of Republicans have been supportive. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=496.96000000000004s)]
*  I try to damp down the division, and I'd like to do that for the country. Right now, as a governor [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=501.20000000000005s)]
*  with the other governors, we have a governor's association, and I really like to create bonds [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=506.40000000000003s)]
*  there. So one never knows, but I'm happy to be governor. Governor Josh Green of Hawaii, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=510.16s)]
*  we really appreciate you taking the time. Thanks for coming by CBS News. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhdlnJKj80&t=515.0400000000001s)]
