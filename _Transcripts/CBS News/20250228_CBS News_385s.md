# How could Russia react to the Trump-Zelenskyy Oval Office meeting?
**CBS News:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM)
*  All right, CBS News senior national security correspondent Charlie Daggett joins us now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=0.0s)]
*  Charlie, the minute that conflict started there in the Oval Office, I was thinking about [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=4.76s)]
*  you, and I want to know your reaction to that exchange between Trump, J.D. Vance, and President [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=8.84s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  You've covered world conflicts. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=16.28s)]
*  You were very involved in covering the start of this war. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=17.54s)]
*  What do you make of that exchange? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Liz, it was absolutely astonishing to watch that unfold. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  We know these arguments happen, you know, and the cameras are off. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=28.46s)]
*  We know that President Zelensky and President Trump haven't seen eye to eye. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=31.78s)]
*  I mean, President Trump called President Zelensky a dictator last week. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=35.06s)]
*  I've interviewed President Zelensky not long ago. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=40.5s)]
*  I went to the front lines with President Zelensky. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=43.38s)]
*  As Nancy pointed out, it's not his first English, it's not his first language. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=45.900000000000006s)]
*  And he sometimes struggles, but he had to take issue with the argument that J.D. Vance [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  pushing toward him, that he wasn't grateful, wasn't thankful enough. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  And then when President Trump weighed in as well, he accused President Zelensky of having [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=60.36s)]
*  hatred for President Putin. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=65.68s)]
*  Of course he has hatred for President Putin. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=67.76s)]
*  He has expressed that hatred. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=70.42s)]
*  Russia invaded Ukraine. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=73.2s)]
*  I was there when Russia invaded Ukraine. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=74.78s)]
*  I was there in 2014, 2015 when Russian-backed separatists took over parts of eastern Ukraine. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=77.44s)]
*  And then, as President Zelensky pointed out, that there was a sort of diplomatic resolution [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=84.12s)]
*  to that, and yet the fighting continued. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=88.92s)]
*  And on that note, by the way, President Putin has said that there were provocations, that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=91.68s)]
*  Ukraine was fighting Russia. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=95.8s)]
*  And that's true. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=98.72s)]
*  The Ukrainian military had continued to fight Russian separatists, Russian-backed separatists [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=100.52s)]
*  in that Donbass region after 2014, 2015, after the Minsk agreement, all the way up until [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=105.66s)]
*  the Russian invasion. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=112.12s)]
*  But make no mistake, Russia invaded Ukraine. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=114.04s)]
*  Not just taking over Crimea, that's in the past. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=117.12s)]
*  This is the full-scale invasion. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=120.82000000000001s)]
*  And while I was there, it was every indication, as President Zelensky pointed out today, yes, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=122.8s)]
*  Ukraine was going to fall in three days. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=127.92s)]
*  Those were the original predictions. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=129.56s)]
*  I saw those Russian tanks. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=131.4s)]
*  I was there when those airstrikes were coming in. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=132.72s)]
*  This is a one-sided war. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=136.4s)]
*  I will go further to say that Ukraine cannot win without America's support. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=138.60000000000002s)]
*  President Trump pointed out that he was the first to arm Ukraine with very important weapons [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=145.88000000000002s)]
*  at the time, the Javelins. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=151.08s)]
*  These were anti-tank weapons and really did stop the Russians in their tracks. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=152.78s)]
*  That was a significant step forward. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=156.8s)]
*  But now look how far we've come with all the artillery, all of the aircraft, tanks, Bradley [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=158.72s)]
*  fighting vehicles, most importantly the air defense systems. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=165.88s)]
*  Those are absolutely critical to defend Ukraine. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=169.56s)]
*  And then the long-range weapons, which was, that was very contentious at the time. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=172.5s)]
*  The Atacoms, they said, we can't use long-range U.S. weapons that might be used to hit Russian [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=176.44s)]
*  territory. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=181.44s)]
*  And all of that has come up. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=182.44s)]
*  So yes, I think everybody is in agreement that this war needs to end. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=183.8s)]
*  We have to stop people from getting killed. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=187.04s)]
*  But this is really given President Putin, I mean, we're going to talk about cards. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=189.18s)]
*  President Putin, many cards to play with. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=196.24s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to ask you next, how do you think he's reacting to this? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=197.72s)]
*  Because you know that he watched this entire exchange. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=200.8s)]
*  He must be celebrating. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=203.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=205.8s)]
*  He will be in Moscow, he'll be celebrating too. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=207.32s)]
*  Because when I was watching that fight take place in the Oval Office, all that was going [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=209.72s)]
*  through my mind is neither one of these sides is going to win, but President Putin will [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=215.04s)]
*  win. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=219.32s)]
*  He will have looked at this with glee. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=220.32s)]
*  They'll be celebrating today because of he has tried to draw a division between the United [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  States, the Trump administration and President Zelensky. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=232.24s)]
*  Putin knows that without American support, he wins. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=236.52s)]
*  I mean, he will take whatever he needs because even with American support, the Ukrainians [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=240.56s)]
*  have been suffering. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=245.86s)]
*  It's been a stalemate for six or seven months. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=247.96s)]
*  The winter is always difficult. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=250.68s)]
*  The fighting continues, but there hasn't been a real change of territory on either side. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=252.48s)]
*  But Russia is huge. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=257.56s)]
*  They've got much more manpower. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=259.6s)]
*  They've got much more air power. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=261.4s)]
*  That's critical. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=262.84s)]
*  They haven't even really used what they can use in terms of their air power. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=263.84s)]
*  They have a larger military, larger population. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=267.84s)]
*  So Putin's in it for the long run. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=271.08s)]
*  If it was ever a war of attrition, President Putin and Russia were going to win. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=273.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=277.64s)]
*  I genuinely don't know. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=278.64s)]
*  I don't think anybody can guess what's going to happen from here. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=279.84s)]
*  Now, what we saw was a sort of heated emotional exchange. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=282.56s)]
*  We don't tend to see that in front of the cameras. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  I can guarantee that those sort of arguments do happen behind closed doors because this [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=288.35999999999996s)]
*  is diplomacy and everybody wants to bring an end to it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=292.56s)]
*  I know what kind of character President Zelensky is. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=295.2s)]
*  He's fiery. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=298.23999999999995s)]
*  If anything, I was looking at him and I thought he was probably he was kind of restraining [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=299.23999999999995s)]
*  himself. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=303.0s)]
*  Because if you looked at his facial expression, I'll tell you this. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=304.0s)]
*  He understands more than he can speak in terms of his grasp of the English language. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=306.98s)]
*  So he understands all of it, but he struggles to put his sentences together as anybody else [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=313.02000000000004s)]
*  who has other languages that they speak. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=318.74s)]
*  So I was looking at his facial expressions as he was hearing what President Trump and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=321.94s)]
*  J.D. Vance was saying to him, these accusations, especially that Ukraine was ungrateful for [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=326.70000000000005s)]
*  the backing of American support. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=332.98s)]
*  I can't imagine how the people in Ukraine are feeling tonight. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=335.98s)]
*  It would be betrayal, abandonment, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=339.02000000000004s)]
*  As President Zelensky and others have said, there's nobody more than the people of Ukraine [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=343.78000000000003s)]
*  who want to see this war come to an end. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=347.3s)]
*  The idea of joining NATO, I think they were willing to sacrifice that. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=351.18s)]
*  The idea of having to let Russia continue to keep the land that they occupy, I think [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=356.02000000000004s)]
*  they were giving that away too. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=364.3s)]
*  The idea of European peacekeepers on their territory, I think that's a reality that they're [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=366.62s)]
*  going to have to come to terms with. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=371.91999999999996s)]
*  Because whatever happens, the conflict does have to come to an end. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=374.09999999999997s)]
*  There are too many people getting killed on both sides. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=377.21999999999997s)]
*  But the people in Ukraine will feel disheartened tonight. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYhSqfwdTM&t=380.58s)]
