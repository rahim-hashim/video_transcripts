# Trump threatens to withhold wildfire aid for California
**CBS News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw)
*  Welcome back to America Decides. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=0.0s)]
*  Our reporter panel is here. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=3.34s)]
*  Tom LoBianco is co-founder and national politics reporter for 24 Sight News. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=4.78s)]
*  Maeve Reston is a national political reporter for the Washington Post and joins us from [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=10.48s)]
*  Los Angeles. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Maeve, I want to start with you because that's where President Trump is heading and he created [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=16.04s)]
*  quite a stir today talking about FEMA and mismanagement and California and restrictions [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=19.76s)]
*  on potential. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=25.1s)]
*  Well, we all know there's going to be federal assistance to Southern California. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=26.64s)]
*  What has been the reaction there to the degree you've been able to detect it? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=31.28s)]
*  Well, so obviously he's been making these threats about placing conditions on wildfire [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=35.88s)]
*  aid to California all the way through the presidential campaign and then more recently [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=43.92s)]
*  on Truth Social. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=51.2s)]
*  Today, he was more specific about having a talking about these two conditions, one being [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  voter ID, as I understand it, and then this this piece of water policy that he's been [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=60.2s)]
*  absolutely obsessed with, which where he argues that Northern California should be sending [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=67.68s)]
*  more water down to Southern California. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=73.88s)]
*  Gavin Newsom's response, the governor of California's response to that has been there is no connection [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=78.12s)]
*  between sending water from Northern California down to Southern California in relation to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=85.36s)]
*  the fires. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=90.36s)]
*  There's no spigot to turn on. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=92.0s)]
*  In fact, as the reporter who just spoke about her fact check noted, the reservoirs, the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=94.76s)]
*  state reservoirs in Southern California were full. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=102.28s)]
*  Today, Governor Newsom had this press conference, a kind of preemptive strike against Trump. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=106.64s)]
*  He's playing a very cautious hand saying that he was going to go to the airport and meet [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=114.48s)]
*  President Trump, even if he wasn't invited to greet Air Force One, although now they [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=120.72s)]
*  have the Trump team has acquiesced and will allow Newsom to greet him. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  He is trying to get the message across that there should be no conditions on fire aid. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  And it's something that the governor's aides and many people here in California are very [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  worried about because obviously the damage estimates are gargantuan and they will [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=144.72s)]
*  California will need the kind of matching assistance or reimbursement for all that damage [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=151.96s)]
*  that has so often been given to other states when these fires take place. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=160.56s)]
*  But obviously, Trump and Newsom have a very antagonistic relationship. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=166.52s)]
*  Newsom has been trying to reset that a bit, dialing back his comments, sending a letter [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=171.96s)]
*  to Trump asking him to visit. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=178.36s)]
*  But it's really that's going to be a tension point, I think, for many months to come as [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=180.84s)]
*  Newsom tries to navigate this new reality where he's basically going to be begging [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=186.64s)]
*  for federal money for California. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=191.72s)]
*  And much of that will also flow through Congress and Congress will have a significant say on [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  this time. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=198.83999999999997s)]
*  I want to talk to you about something else that the Senate will have a big say on, which [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=199.83999999999997s)]
*  is RFK Jr.'s confirmation hearing next week. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=202.66s)]
*  He wrote a biography of Mike Pence. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=205.67999999999998s)]
*  Mike Pence is in a very particular kind of wilderness politically. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=207.23999999999998s)]
*  He was at the inauguration. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=211.54s)]
*  He shook the president's hand at Jimmy Carter's funeral. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=213.6s)]
*  And he's opposing RFK Jr., trying to maintain his relevance in the political sphere, have [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=217.5s)]
*  some influence, but he knows he's on the outs. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  It's remarkable. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=225.24s)]
*  If you look at somebody who has been put to pasture politically, we shouldn't be hearing [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=226.64s)]
*  from him under the old rules of politics. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=231.16s)]
*  We're in a new world. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=235.16s)]
*  His group, Advancing American Freedom, still gets plenty of money, still hires plenty of [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=236.6s)]
*  staff. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=241.84s)]
*  And he's a very experienced economist in the pro-life anti-abortion movement. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=243.08s)]
*  And of course, the timing of this, very conspicuous, actually, if you think about it, with RFK [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=246.76s)]
*  Jr.'s nomination coming up right as the March for Life is happening here in D.C. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=251.76s)]
*  So this is a very big deal. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=257.0s)]
*  Pence is all... [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  This is how I pitch the book to my agent. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=262.4s)]
*  I'm like, this guy looks boring. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=264.36s)]
*  I don't know how he does it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  Actually, I do know how he does it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=268.4s)]
*  He's masterful at inserting himself into situations at precisely the right moment. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=269.78s)]
*  And he did it again here with this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=275.88s)]
*  So he's hitting a pivot point. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  And if you look at RFK Jr., so HHS deals more with... [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=281.38s)]
*  Health and Human Services, right. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=285.34s)]
*  Deals more with spending to the states. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=287.67999999999995s)]
*  Pence used to do this when he was governor, the battles over abortion policy and the Medicaid [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=290.14s)]
*  expansion. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=295.17999999999995s)]
*  And when he was doing that, he was fighting Obama. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=298.18s)]
*  And he was very good at positioning himself against Obama on his way up. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=301.14s)]
*  RFK is maybe not pro-choice, but certainly not pro-life. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=305.53999999999996s)]
*  And this is the big wedge. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=311.09999999999997s)]
*  It has a long track record. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=312.09999999999997s)]
*  Lots of sound bites, lots of things attributed to him in this space. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=313.18s)]
*  And it's ironic because if you look at... [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=317.78s)]
*  Pence helped get Trump in front of the March for Life crowd back in 2017 on video, and [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=320.86s)]
*  then in person, I think 2019 or 2020, Trump will be marching with J.D. Vance in the parade [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=326.14000000000004s)]
*  for this. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=332.66s)]
*  And of course, Vance is ascendant right now. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=333.66s)]
*  A lot of talk about him for 2028. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=335.3s)]
*  But Pence is reminding people that, hey, this guy will be overseeing the money with regard [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=339.5s)]
*  to abortion. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=344.08000000000004s)]
*  And some of the regulatory decisions that flow through HHS. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=345.08000000000004s)]
*  Do you have any sense that this advocacy from Pence will get the attention of Senate Republicans [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=347.5s)]
*  and possibly jeopardize RFK Jr.'s confirmation? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=353.8s)]
*  I don't know that it's enough to tilt the nomination. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=357.12s)]
*  Certainly not in the way that Hegseth or Gabbard are in trouble right now. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=360.32s)]
*  But it'll put a lot of pressure on in the hearing. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=365.4s)]
*  Maeve, I want to go back to you because what is the situation as fires continue to not [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  just burn the original ones? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=375.56s)]
*  They're moving toward full containment, but other fires have broken out in the Los Angeles [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=377.56s)]
*  area. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=381.44s)]
*  Rain is coming, as I understand it, forecast this weekend. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=382.52s)]
*  Lots of complications. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=385.48s)]
*  Lots of complications. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=387.84s)]
*  And, you know, a lot of people living here in L.A. who feel really traumatized by how [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=388.84s)]
*  quickly these fires have moved. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=395.52s)]
*  We saw the Hughes fire the other night racing well across 8,000 acres in a matter of hours [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=397.32s)]
*  and endangering homes. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=404.64s)]
*  And now we have rain forecast for the weekend. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=406.52s)]
*  So Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who's also quite embattled at the moment, was out this [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=409.76000000000005s)]
*  week showing sandbags and dump trucks full of sand and K-Rail that they were going to [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=415.6s)]
*  put up to keep toxic chemicals from flowing into the ocean. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=422.72s)]
*  But a lot of this is sort of a moment where Californians are having to come to grips with [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=429.12s)]
*  these dangers that they are living with every day. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=436.72s)]
*  And so the added layer of members of Congress, Republican members of Congress, talking about [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=440.16s)]
*  setting conditions on wildfire aid has really enraged a lot of people here. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=446.92s)]
*  And this meeting that Trump is about to have in Los Angeles with a lot of local officials, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=453.48s)]
*  they are hoping to really convey to him that, you know, there are a lot of people in Los [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=459.88000000000005s)]
*  Angeles who voted for him and there are a lot of constituents that he needs to take [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=464.68s)]
*  care of just as presidents have in many years past. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=469.6s)]
*  In disasters and every day, we're all Americans. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=475.12s)]
*  I know the local officials will be reminding the president of something that he sometimes, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=477.84000000000003s)]
*  maybe just with a rhetorical flourish, tends to diminish or overlook. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=482.24s)]
*  Tom LoBianco, Maeve Reston, thank you very much. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emMxeVTmbuw&t=485.72s)]
