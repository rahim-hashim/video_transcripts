# Trump, Musk take questions at White House
**CBS News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ)
*  Hi, everyone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Moments ago, the President and Elon Musk were in the Oval Office answering questions. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=6.0s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=9.72s)]
*  X, are you okay? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=10.72s)]
*  This is X, and he's a great guy. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=11.72s)]
*  High IQ. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  He's a high IQ individual. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  And he's got this cool train he's got. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  So thank you very much. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=22.88s)]
*  We had a busy day today. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=23.88s)]
*  The King just left, and we've had a great discussion, terrific discussion, concerning [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=24.88s)]
*  Gaza and everything else. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=31.72s)]
*  We had discussions also about Saturday at 12 o'clock. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=34.68s)]
*  It's going to be a big moment. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=39.44s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=41.04s)]
*  I don't expect much happening with these people, but we'll see what happens. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=42.04s)]
*  And we're going to be signing a very important deal today. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  It's Doge. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=51.28s)]
*  And I'm going to ask Elon to tell you a little bit about it and some of the things that we [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=52.76s)]
*  found, which are shocking. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=57.6s)]
*  Billions and billions of dollars in waste, fraud, and abuse. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=60.24s)]
*  And I think it's very important. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=64.68s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons I got elected. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=66.6s)]
*  I said we're going to do that. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=68.4s)]
*  Nobody had any idea it was that bad, that sick, and that corrupt. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=70.44s)]
*  And it seems hard to believe that judges want to try and stop us from looking for corruption, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=74.32s)]
*  especially when we found hundreds of millions of dollars worth, much more than that, in [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=79.08000000000001s)]
*  just a short period of time. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=84.68s)]
*  We want to weed out the corruption. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  And it seems hard to believe that a judge could say, we don't want you to do that. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  So maybe we have to look at the judges, because that's very serious. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=93.64s)]
*  I think it's a very serious violation. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=97.36000000000001s)]
*  I'll ask Elon Musk to say a few words, and we'll take some questions. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  Elon, go ahead. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=106.68s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=109.11999999999999s)]
*  So at a high level, if you say, what is the goal of Dojo, and I think a significant part [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=110.11999999999999s)]
*  of the presidency, is to restore democracy. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  This may seem like, well, are we in a democracy? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  Well, if you don't have a feedback group, FKX, we'd have to... [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=125.08s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=129.04s)]
*  Tell you, gravitas can be difficult sometimes. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=130.04s)]
*  So if there's not a good feedback group from the people to the government, and if you have [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=135.76s)]
*  rule of the bureaucrat, if the bureaucracy is in charge, then what meaning does democracy [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=143.92s)]
*  actually have? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=150.16s)]
*  If the people cannot vote and have their will be decided by their elected representatives [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=151.56s)]
*  in the form of the president and the Senate and the House, then we don't live in a democracy. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  We live in a bureaucracy. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=162.84s)]
*  So it's incredibly important that we close that feedback group, we fix that feedback [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=165.28s)]
*  group, and that the public's elected representatives, the president, the House, and the Senate, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=168.52s)]
*  decide what happens, as opposed to a large, unelected bureaucracy. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=175.2s)]
*  This is not to say that there aren't some good... [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=179.16s)]
*  There are good people who are in the federal bureaucracy, but you can't have an autonomous [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=182.04s)]
*  federal bureaucracy. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=188.96s)]
*  You have to have one that is responsive to the people. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=189.96s)]
*  That's the whole point of a democracy. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=193.24s)]
*  And if you asked the founders today, what do you think of the way things have turned [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=195.96s)]
*  out? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=203.36s)]
*  Well, we have this unelected, fourth unconstitutional branch of government, which is the bureaucracy, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=204.36s)]
*  which has, in a lot of ways, currently more power than any elected representative. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=210.8s)]
*  And this is not something that people want. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=216.24s)]
*  It does not match the will of the people. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=222.8s)]
*  So it's just something we've got to fix. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  And we've also got to address the deficit. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=226.60000000000002s)]
*  So we've got a $2 trillion deficit. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=228.4s)]
*  And if we don't do something about this deficit, the country's going bankrupt. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  It's really astounding that the interest payments alone on the national debt exceed the Defense [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  Department budget, which is shocking, because we spend a lot of money on defense. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=243.96s)]
*  And if that just keeps going, we're essentially going to bankrupt the country. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=251.16s)]
*  So what I really would say is, it's not optional for us to reduce the federal expenses. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=254.16s)]
*  It's essential. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=259.72s)]
*  It's essential for America to remain solvent as a country. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=261.38s)]
*  And it's essential for America to have the resources necessary to provide things to its [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=265.34000000000003s)]
*  citizens and not simply be servicing vast amounts of debt. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=269.44s)]
*  And also, could you mention some of the things that your team has found, some of the crazy [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=273.92s)]
*  numbers, including the woman that walked away with about $30 million, et cetera? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, we do find it sort of rather odd that there are quite a few people in the bureaucracy [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=284.44000000000005s)]
*  who have ostensibly a salary of a few hundred thousand dollars, but somehow manage to accrue [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=294.44000000000005s)]
*  tens of millions of dollars in net worth while they are in that position, which is what happened [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  at USAID. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm curious as to where it came from. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=307.4s)]
*  Maybe they're very good at investing, in which case we should take their investment advice [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=308.4s)]
*  perhaps. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=312.84s)]
*  But just, there seems to be mysteriously they get wealthy. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=313.84s)]
*  We don't know why. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=318.88s)]
*  Where does it come from? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=319.88s)]
*  And I think the reality is that they're getting wealthy at a taxpayer expense. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  That's the honest truth of it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=326.4s)]
*  So we're looking at, say, well, if you look at, say, Treasury, for example, basic controls [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=328.36s)]
*  that should be in place, that are in place in any company, such as making sure that any [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=339.36s)]
*  given payment has a payment categorization code, that there is a comment field that describes [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=344.8s)]
*  the payment, and that if a payment is on the do not pay list, that you don't actually pay [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=349.40000000000003s)]
*  it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=355.08000000000004s)]
*  None of those things are true currently. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=356.12s)]
*  So the reason that departments can't pass audits is because the payments don't have [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=358.52s)]
*  a categorization code. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=363.03999999999996s)]
*  It's like just a massive number of blank checks just flying out the building. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=364.03999999999996s)]
*  So you can't reconcile blank checks. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=367.88s)]
*  You've got comment fields that are also blanks. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=370.78s)]
*  You don't know why the payment was made. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=372.36s)]
*  And then we've got this truly absurd, a do not pay list, which can take up to a year [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=374.88s)]
*  for an organization to get on the do not pay list. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  We're talking about terrorist organizations. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=384.48s)]
*  We're talking about known fraudsters, known aspects of waste, known things that do not [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=386.2s)]
*  match any congressional appropriation. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=391.64s)]
*  It can take up to a year to get on the list. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=393.08s)]
*  And even once on the list, the list is not used. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=395.6s)]
*  It's mind blowing. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=399.68s)]
*  So what we're talking about here, we're really just talking about adding common sense controls [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=401.68s)]
*  that should be present that haven't been present. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=407.22s)]
*  So you say, well, how could such a thing arise? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=411.88s)]
*  That seems crazy. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=414.92s)]
*  When you understand that really everything is geared towards complaint minimization, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=416.68s)]
*  so then you understand the motivations. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=421.92s)]
*  So if people receive money, they don't complain, obviously. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=424.96000000000004s)]
*  But if people don't receive money, they do complain. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=428.92s)]
*  And the fraudsters complain the loudest and the fastest. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=432.32000000000005s)]
*  So then when you understand that, then it makes sense. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=435.96000000000004s)]
*  That's why everything just, they approve all the payments at Treasury. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=440.44s)]
*  Because if you approve all the payments, you don't get complaints. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=445.28s)]
*  But now we're saying that, no, actually, we are going to complain. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=450.08s)]
*  If money is spent badly, if your taxpayer dollars are not spent in a sensible and [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=453.4s)]
*  prugal manner, then that's not okay. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=457.56s)]
*  Your tax dollars need to be spent wisely on things that matter to the people. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=461.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, these things, it's just common sense. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=467.0s)]
*  It's not draconian or radical, I think. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=469.32s)]
*  It's really just saying, let's look at each of these expenditures and [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=474.36s)]
*  say, is this actually in the best interest of the people? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=477.71999999999997s)]
*  And if it is, it's approved. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=480.76s)]
*  If it's not, we should think about it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=481.64s)]
*  So, you know, there's crazy things like just [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=484.76s)]
*  grocery examination of social security. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=489.4s)]
*  And we've got people in there that are 150 years old. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=491.92s)]
*  Now, do you know anyone that's 150? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=494.96s)]
*  I don't, okay. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=497.2s)]
*  They should be on the Guinness Book of World Records. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=498.91999999999996s)]
*  They're messing out. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=501.23999999999995s)]
*  So, you know, that's a case where, like, I think they're probably dead. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=503.76s)]
*  It's my guess. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=506.96s)]
*  Or they should be very famous, one of the two. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=508.47999999999996s)]
*  And then there's a whole bunch of social security payments where there's no [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=512.6s)]
*  identifying information. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=514.96s)]
*  Well, why is there no identifying information? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=516.8s)]
*  Obviously, we want to make sure that people who deserve to receive social [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=520.36s)]
*  security do receive it and that they receive it quickly and accurately. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=524.52s)]
*  Also, another crazy thing. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=530.28s)]
*  So, you know, one of the things is like we are trying to sort of right size the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=531.5600000000001s)]
*  federal bureaucracy, just make sure that this, obviously, there needs to be a lot [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=535.84s)]
*  of people working for the federal government, but not as many as currently. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=539.24s)]
*  So, we're saying, well, okay, well, if people can retire, you know, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=542.36s)]
*  with full benefits and everything, that would be good. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=546.76s)]
*  They can retire, get their retirement payments, everything. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=549.24s)]
*  And then we were told, this is actually, I think, a great anecdote. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=551.9200000000001s)]
*  The most number of people that could retire possibly in a month is 10,000. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=555.28s)]
*  We're like, well, why is that? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=559.64s)]
*  Well, because all the retirement paperwork is manual on paper. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=562.52s)]
*  It's manually calculated, then written down on a piece of paper. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=567.84s)]
*  Then it goes down a mine. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=570.5600000000001s)]
*  And like, what do you mean a mine? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=572.72s)]
*  Like, yeah, there's a limestone mine where we store all the retirement paperwork. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=574.16s)]
*  And you look at a picture of this mine, we'll post some pictures afterwards. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=580.16s)]
*  And this mine looks like something out of the 50s, because it was started in 1955. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=584.4s)]
*  So it looks like it's like a time warp. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=589.52s)]
*  And then the speed, then the limiting factor is the speed at which the mine [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=592.76s)]
*  shaft elevator can move determines how many people can retire from the federal government. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=596.48s)]
*  And the elevator breaks down sometimes, and then nobody can retire. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=603.64s)]
*  Doesn't that sound crazy? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=609.04s)]
*  There's like a thousand people that work on this. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=610.88s)]
*  So I think if we take those people and say, you know what, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=612.84s)]
*  instead of working in a mine shaft and carrying manila envelopes to boxes in a mine shaft, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=615.84s)]
*  you could do practically anything else. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=623.64s)]
*  And you would add to the goods and services of the United States in a more useful way. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=625.9200000000001s)]
*  So anyway, so I think that's an example. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=633.0400000000001s)]
*  Like at a high level, if you say, how do we increase prosperity? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=637.44s)]
*  Is we get people to shift from roles that are low to negative productivity to high productivity roles. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=639.92s)]
*  And so increase the total output of goods and services, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=647.48s)]
*  which means that there's a higher standard of living available for everyone. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=650.0s)]
*  That's the actual goal. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=654.12s)]
*  Everyone's very quiet, by the way. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=657.4s)]
*  Is it normal that nobody is quiet? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=659.4s)]
*  You're detractors, Mr. Musk. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=660.72s)]
*  I have to what? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=663.56s)]
*  Including a lot of Democrats. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=664.2s)]
*  I have detractors? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=666.2s)]
*  You do, sir. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=667.24s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=667.88s)]
*  You say that you're orchestrating a hostile takeover of government and doing it in a non-transparent way. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=668.88s)]
*  What's your response to that criticism? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=675.6s)]
*  Well, first of all, you couldn't ask for a stronger mandate from the public. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=678.08s)]
*  The public voted. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=684.0s)]
*  We have a majority of the public vote voting for President Trump. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=687.36s)]
*  We've won the House. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=691.68s)]
*  We won the Senate. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=693.0s)]
*  The people voted for major government reform. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=694.56s)]
*  There should be no doubt about that. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=700.48s)]
*  That was on the campaign. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=701.84s)]
*  The president spoke about that at every rally. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=703.84s)]
*  The people voted for major government reform, and that's what people are going to get. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=706.3199999999999s)]
*  They're going to get what they voted for. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=710.16s)]
*  And a lot of times, people that don't get what they voted for, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=712.48s)]
*  but in this presidency, they are going to get what they voted for. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=716.16s)]
*  And that's what democracy is all about. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=719.2s)]
*  Mr. Musk, the White House says that you will identify and excuse yourself from any conflicts of interest that you may have. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=721.84s)]
*  Does that mean that you are, in effect, policing yourself? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=728.08s)]
*  What are the checks and balances that are in place to ensure that there is accountability and transparency? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=731.12s)]
*  No. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=735.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, we actually are trying to be as transparent as possible. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=736.48s)]
*  In fact, our actions, we post our actions to the Doge handle on X and to the Doge website. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=739.2800000000001s)]
*  So all of our actions are maximally transparent. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=747.68s)]
*  In fact, I don't know of a case where an organization has been more transparent than the Doge organization. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=751.68s)]
*  The kind of things we're doing are, I think, very simple and basic. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=762.64s)]
*  What I mentioned, for example, about Treasury, just making sure that payments that go out, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=767.68s)]
*  taxpayer money that goes out, is categorized correctly, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=772.48s)]
*  that the payment is explained, that organizations on the Do Not Pay List, which takes a lot to get there, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=776.16s)]
*  that actually are not paid, which currently they are paid. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=782.48s)]
*  These are not individual judgment decisions. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=786.64s)]
*  These are about simply having sensible checks and balances in the system itself to ensure that taxpayer money is spent well. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=789.12s)]
*  So it's got nothing to do with, say, a contract for some company of mine at all. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=795.12s)]
*  But if there is a conflict of interest when it comes to you yourself, for instance, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=799.04s)]
*  you've received billions of dollars in federal contracts when it comes to the Pentagon, for instance, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=803.04s)]
*  which the president, I know, has directed you to look into. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=808.4s)]
*  Are you policing yourself in that? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=811.04s)]
*  Is there any sort of accountability check and balance in place that would provide any transparency for the American people? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=812.7199999999999s)]
*  Well, all of our actions are fully public. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=819.36s)]
*  So if you see anything, you say, like, wait a second, hey, that seems like maybe there's a conflict there. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=823.04s)]
*  It's not like people are going to be shy about saying that. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=830.8s)]
*  They'll say it immediately. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=832.64s)]
*  Including you yourself. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=833.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=834.96s)]
*  Transparency is what builds trust. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=837.76s)]
*  Not simply somebody asserting trust. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=839.6s)]
*  So not somebody saying they're trustworthy, but transparency. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=841.84s)]
*  So you can see everything that's going on. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=844.8s)]
*  And you can see, am I doing something that benefits one of my companies or not? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=846.64s)]
*  It's totally obvious. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=850.3199999999999s)]
*  And if we thought that, we would not let him do that segment or look in that area. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=852.0s)]
*  If we thought there was a lack of transparency or a conflict of interest. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=856.8s)]
*  And we watched that also. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=861.76s)]
*  He's a big businessman. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=864.4s)]
*  He's a successful guy. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=865.76s)]
*  That's why we want him doing this. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=866.72s)]
*  We don't want an unsuccessful guy doing this. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=868.08s)]
*  Now, one thing also that Elon hasn't really mentioned are the groups of people that are getting some of these payments. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=872.16s)]
*  They're ridiculous. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=879.4399999999999s)]
*  And we're talking about billions of dollars that we've already found. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=880.88s)]
*  We found fraud and abuse. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=883.68s)]
*  I would say those two words as opposed to the third word that I usually use. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=887.6s)]
*  But in this case, fraud and abuse. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=891.04s)]
*  It's abusive because most of these things are virtually made up or certainly money shouldn't be sent to them. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=894.48s)]
*  And you know what I'm talking about. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=901.36s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=902.9599999999999s)]
*  But we're talking about tens of billions of dollars that we've already found. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=905.4399999999999s)]
*  And now a judge who's an activist judge wants to try and stop us from doing this. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=910.9599999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=917.5999999999999s)]
*  And why would they want to do that? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=917.92s)]
*  I campaigned on this. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=918.9599999999999s)]
*  I campaigned on the fact that I said government is corrupt. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=919.92s)]
*  And it is very corrupt. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=923.4399999999999s)]
*  It's very, very. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=924.8s)]
*  It's also foolish. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=926.4799999999999s)]
*  As an example, a man has a contract for three months and the contract ends, but they keep paying him for the next 20 years. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=928.88s)]
*  You know, because nobody ends a contract. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=935.76s)]
*  You get a lot of that. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=937.36s)]
*  You have a contract that's a three, a three month contract. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=938.16s)]
*  Now, normally, if you're in a small and in all fairness, it's the size of this thing is so big. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=942.64s)]
*  But if you have a contract and you're in a regular business, you end the contract in three months. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=948.32s)]
*  You know, it's a consultant. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=953.28s)]
*  Here's a contract for three months, but it goes on for 20 years. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=955.36s)]
*  And the guy doesn't say that he got money for 20 years. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=959.76s)]
*  You know, they don't say it. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=962.0s)]
*  They just keep getting checks month after month. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=963.0400000000001s)]
*  And you have various things like that. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=965.6s)]
*  And even much worse than that, actually, much worse. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=967.76s)]
*  And I guess you call that incompetence. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=970.8000000000001s)]
*  Maybe it could be corruption. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=972.5600000000001s)]
*  It could be a deal is made on both sides. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=974.32s)]
*  You know, where you get some money, he kicks. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=976.08s)]
*  I think he has a lot of kickback here. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=979.04s)]
*  I see a lot of kickback here. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=980.8s)]
*  There's a lot of kickbacks. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=982.16s)]
*  Yeah, tremendous kickback because nobody could be so stupid to give out some of these contracts. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=982.96s)]
*  So he has to get a kickback. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=987.04s)]
*  So that's what I got elected for that and borders and military and a lot of things. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=989.12s)]
*  But this is a big part of it. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=995.92s)]
*  And I hope that the court system is going to allow us to do what we have to do. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=998.0s)]
*  We got elected to, among other things, find all of this fraud, abuse, all of this horrible stuff going on. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1002.96s)]
*  And we've already found billions of dollars, not like a little bit, billions, many billions of dollars. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1010.96s)]
*  And when you get down to it, it's going to be probably close to a trillion dollars. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1018.5600000000001s)]
*  It could be close to a trillion dollars that we're going to find. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1023.2800000000001s)]
*  That will have quite an impact on the budget. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1026.96s)]
*  And you'll go to a judge with a handpick of judge and he has certain leanings. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1029.28s)]
*  I'm not knocking anybody for that, but he has certain leanings. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1035.04s)]
*  And he wants us to stop looking. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1038.08s)]
*  How do you stop looking? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1041.28s)]
*  I mean, we've already found it. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1042.2399999999998s)]
*  We have a case in New York where a hotel has paid $59 million, $59 million because of because it's housing migrants, illegal migrants, all illegal, I believe. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1043.76s)]
*  And they were being paid twice the normal room rate at 100% occupancy. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1057.44s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1060.48s)]
*  So it's a racket. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1061.1200000000001s)]
*  I just must ask a question. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1061.68s)]
*  Well, if I may just go into the president's comments. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1063.52s)]
*  At a high level, what are the two ingredients that are really necessary in order to cut the budget deficit in half, from $2 trillion to $1 trillion? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1069.28s)]
*  And it's really two things, competence and caring. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1081.28s)]
*  And if you add competence and caring, you'll cut the budget deficit in half. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1086.48s)]
*  And I fully expect to be scrutinized and get a daily proctology exam, basically. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1091.92s)]
*  I just want to camp out there. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1097.6s)]
*  So it's not like I think I can get away with something. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1099.92s)]
*  I'll be scrutinized nonstop. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1102.48s)]
*  And but with the support of the president, we can cut the budget deficit in half from $2 trillion to $1 trillion. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1105.04s)]
*  And then with deregulation, because there's a lot of sort of regulations that don't ultimately serve the public good. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1111.36s)]
*  We need to free the builders of America to build. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1119.04s)]
*  And if we do that, that means I think we get the economic growth to be maybe 3%, 4%, maybe 5%. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1122.3999999999999s)]
*  And that means if you can get $1 trillion of economic growth and you cut the budget deficit by a trillion, between now and next year, there is no inflation. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1129.76s)]
*  There's no inflation at 26. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1139.6799999999998s)]
*  And if the government is not borrowing as much, it means that interest costs decline. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1141.9199999999998s)]
*  So everyone's the mortgage, their car payment, their credit card bills, their student debt, their monthly payments drop. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1146.08s)]
*  That's a fantastic scenario for the average American. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1155.12s)]
*  I mean, imagine they go down the grocery aisle and the prices for one year to the next are the same. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1160.2399999999998s)]
*  And their mortgage, all their debt payments dropped. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1166.48s)]
*  How great is that for the average American? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1173.76s)]
*  We had no idea we were going to find this much. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1176.96s)]
*  And it's open. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1180.8s)]
*  It's not like complicated. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1181.6s)]
*  It's simple stuff. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1183.52s)]
*  It's like we can't believe it. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1185.28s)]
*  A lot of work, a lot of smart people involved. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1187.1200000000001s)]
*  Very, very smart people. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1189.44s)]
*  But it's you're talking about anywhere, maybe 500 billion dollars. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1190.6399999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1196.72s)]
*  The kind of numbers you're talking about. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1197.6799999999998s)]
*  You know, normally when you're looking at something, you'll find you're looking for one out of 100. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1199.84s)]
*  Here, you're almost reversing it. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1204.24s)]
*  You look for one that's good. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1206.24s)]
*  And you can look at the title and you say, why are we doing this? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1208.3999999999999s)]
*  Why are we doing that? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1211.6799999999998s)]
*  And the public gets it. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1212.72s)]
*  You know, the public gets it. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1213.84s)]
*  You've seen the polls. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1214.96s)]
*  The public is saying, why are we paying all this money? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1216.08s)]
*  This is for years. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1218.3999999999999s)]
*  This has gone on. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1219.76s)]
*  Senator Rand Paul today said that Doge cuts will ultimately need a vote in Congress. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1224.56s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1228.8799999999999s)]
*  Is that the plan? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1229.68s)]
*  I really don't know. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1230.24s)]
*  I know this. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1231.12s)]
*  We're finding tremendous fraud and tremendous abuse. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1232.24s)]
*  If I need a vote of Congress to find fraud and abuse, it's fine with me. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1236.16s)]
*  I think we'll get the vote. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1240.64s)]
*  Although there'll be some people that wouldn't vote. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1242.32s)]
*  And how could a judge want to hold us back from finding all of this fraud [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1244.64s)]
*  and finding all of this incompetence? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1248.8000000000002s)]
*  Why would that happen? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1252.0800000000002s)]
*  Why would even Congress want to do that? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1253.0400000000002s)]
*  Now, Congress, if we do need a vote, I think we'd get a very easy vote [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1254.88s)]
*  because we have a track record now. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1258.5600000000002s)]
*  We've already found billions of dollars of abuse, incompetence, and corruption. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1260.3200000000002s)]
*  A lot of corruption. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1266.88s)]
*  If a judge does block one of your policies, part of your agenda, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1268.0s)]
*  will you abide by that ruling? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1271.6000000000001s)]
*  Will you comply with that? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1273.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, I always abide by the courts and then I'll have to appeal it. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1273.8400000000001s)]
*  But then what he's done is he slowed down the momentum [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1276.56s)]
*  and it gives crooked people more time to cover up the books. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1280.0s)]
*  You know, if a person's crooked and they get caught, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1284.56s)]
*  other people see that and all of a sudden it becomes harder later on. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1287.44s)]
*  So, yeah, the answer is I always abide by the courts. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1291.12s)]
*  Always abide by them and will appeal. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1295.12s)]
*  But appeals take a long time. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1298.0s)]
*  And I would hope that a judge, if you go into a judge and you show them, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1299.6799999999998s)]
*  here's a corrupt situation. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1303.44s)]
*  We have a check to be sent, but we found it to be corrupt. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1305.76s)]
*  Do you want us to send this corrupt check to a person [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1309.84s)]
*  or do you want us not to give it and give it back to the taxpayer? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1312.8799999999999s)]
*  I would hope a judge would say don't send it, give it back to the taxpayer. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1316.4s)]
*  Yeah, if I can add to that, what we're finding is that [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1319.84s)]
*  a bunch of the fraud is not even going to Americans. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1323.04s)]
*  So I think we can all agree that if there's going to be fraud, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1325.6s)]
*  it should at least go to Americans. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1328.0s)]
*  But a bunch of the fraud rings that are operating in the United States [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1330.0s)]
*  and taking advantage of the federal government, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1332.8799999999999s)]
*  especially in the entitlements programs, are actually foreign fraud rings. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1334.56s)]
*  They're operating in other countries and actually exporting money to other countries. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1337.6s)]
*  We should stop that. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1342.56s)]
*  And this is big numbers, so about $100 to $200 billion a year. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1345.28s)]
*  Serious money. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1349.12s)]
*  Mr. Musk, you said on X that an example of the fraud that you have cited [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1350.0s)]
*  was $50 million of condoms were sent to Gaza. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1355.9199999999998s)]
*  But after fact-checked this, apparently Gaza in Mozambique, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1360.0s)]
*  and the program was to protect them against HIV. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1364.72s)]
*  So can you correct the statements that wasn't sent to Hamas actually, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1368.3200000000002s)]
*  it was sent to Mozambique, which makes sense why condoms were sent there? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1372.0800000000002s)]
*  And how can we make sure that all the statements that you said were correct [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1375.68s)]
*  so we can trust what you say? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1380.16s)]
*  Well, first of all, some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1381.44s)]
*  So nobody can about $1,000. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1386.4s)]
*  I mean, we will make mistakes, but we'll act quickly to correct any mistakes. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1388.48s)]
*  I'm not sure we should be sending $50 million worth of condoms to anywhere, frankly. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1396.88s)]
*  I'm not sure that's something Americans would be really excited about. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1401.1200000000001s)]
*  That is really an enormous number of condoms, if you think about it. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1404.96s)]
*  But if it went to Mozambique instead of Gaza, I'm like, okay, that's not as bad, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1408.56s)]
*  but still, why are we doing that? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1412.88s)]
*  Mr. Muth, can you talk a little bit about how closely you're working with agency heads [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1415.7600000000002s)]
*  as you're directing these cuts? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1420.5600000000002s)]
*  How much input do agency heads have when you're making these decisions? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1424.8000000000002s)]
*  We work closely with the agency heads. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1428.48s)]
*  There are sort of checks in place, so it's not just us just going in and doing things willy-nilly. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1434.88s)]
*  It's in partnership with the agency heads. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1438.48s)]
*  And I check with the president to make sure that this is what the president wants to happen. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1442.56s)]
*  We talk almost every day, and I double check things to make sure. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1450.08s)]
*  Is this something, Mr. President, you want us to do this? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1454.56s)]
*  Well, then we'll do it. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1457.1200000000001s)]
*  USAID has been one of your main targets. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1459.6s)]
*  Are you concerned at all that some of the cuts or that shutting that agency altogether [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1462.72s)]
*  may lead to diseases or other bigger problems starting in other countries [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1467.04s)]
*  that then come to the United States? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1471.52s)]
*  Yeah, so that's an interesting example. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1473.68s)]
*  So that's something where we work closely. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1475.6s)]
*  We've been listening to Elon Musk and President Trump speak from the Oval Office. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1477.12s)]
*  The president signing an executive order to force federal agencies to coordinate and [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1480.1599999999999s)]
*  consult with DOJ, the Department of Government Efficiency. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1484.3999999999999s)]
*  I want to bring in our chief Washington correspondent, Major Garrett now. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1487.52s)]
*  I mean, Major, when you listen to what they're talking about, cutting waste, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1491.44s)]
*  restoring democracy. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1495.84s)]
*  I'm going to read a little bit more of what they said. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1498.32s)]
*  With competence and caring, you can cut the budget deficit in half. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1501.84s)]
*  If we do that, there's no inflation in 2026. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1505.52s)]
*  All of this sounds very good. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1508.3999999999999s)]
*  It would be hard to argue with what they're saying, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1509.4399999999998s)]
*  but it really takes away the reality of the situation. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1511.28s)]
*  USAID workers cut off from pay and insurance. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1514.3999999999999s)]
*  Food stuck in warehouses going rotten. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1517.4399999999998s)]
*  People in clinical trials that are now in limbo because those have ended. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1520.08s)]
*  Do you agree? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1524.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1526.08s)]
*  All of those are practical realities of immediately stopping federal payments [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1526.6399999999999s)]
*  to various agencies and federal workers in the United States. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1532.56s)]
*  Some recipients of research grants, some being cared for by those medical research grants, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1537.1999999999998s)]
*  as you just indicated, and some Americans in very dangerous hot spots around the world [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1542.24s)]
*  working for USAID who don't know if they can even come back home, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1546.8s)]
*  if they will have a job, health care, all these uncertainties. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1550.6399999999999s)]
*  Yes, the American people had a referendum on government reform. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1554.56s)]
*  President Trump won that referendum. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1559.92s)]
*  He is entitled to exercise some manner of control over the executive branch. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1562.16s)]
*  There is nothing illegal about that, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1566.8s)]
*  and there is something potentially politically valuable in doing that. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1568.64s)]
*  And scrubbing the vast network of federal payments is probably long overdue. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1572.64s)]
*  But when you get down to the specifics, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1578.16s)]
*  like Elon Musk was just asked about something President Trump said repeatedly last week. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1580.32s)]
*  First, it was $50 million in condoms to Hamas. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1585.36s)]
*  Then it was $100 million. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1588.56s)]
*  That is completely false. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1590.64s)]
*  100% false. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1592.56s)]
*  It was never true. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1594.08s)]
*  And Elon Musk just said, oh, well, we'll sometimes make mistakes. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1595.44s)]
*  That wasn't a mistake. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1599.28s)]
*  That was an intentional effort to say, look at all that we've found that is so horrifying. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1600.88s)]
*  And when you dig down deeper, it's not nearly what was described. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1606.48s)]
*  And if that's consistent with how these efforts are going to be described, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1610.48s)]
*  President Trump said again, hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1615.84s)]
*  Well, if that falsehood last week is representative of what they're finding [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1619.28s)]
*  and they're misleading the public about, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1624.24s)]
*  then we need to be much more cautious about the assertions [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1626.0s)]
*  and the guarantees of transparency that on closer inspection may not actually bear out. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1628.96s)]
*  I'm glad you mentioned that as well, saying, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1635.1200000000001s)]
*  okay, what does it matter if it goes to Gaza or Mozambique? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1636.88s)]
*  Either way, it's not good. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1639.28s)]
*  And also interesting to note that Elon Musk was asked about conflicts of interest [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1640.56s)]
*  in terms of the government contracts he had. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1645.04s)]
*  And the response was essentially people won't be shy about that. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1646.72s)]
*  So no clear answers on the checks and balances there. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1650.0s)]
*  But Major, I did want to ask you also, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1652.32s)]
*  we know that we have a three branch of government system. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1654.48s)]
*  Elon Musk, rather, the president was asked, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1657.68s)]
*  do you think you'll need a vote in Congress to make Doge cuts? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1660.48s)]
*  And the president said, I don't know. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1662.96s)]
*  But how would a judge want to hold us back? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1664.6399999999999s)]
*  And also saying we'd have the votes. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1666.6399999999999s)]
*  Essentially saying that the executive branch should have [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1668.24s)]
*  unilateral authority to make these changes. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1670.72s)]
*  Lindsay, I'm not a White House advisor, not to this one, not to any White House. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1673.04s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1676.4s)]
*  But there's a process. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1676.96s)]
*  There's a very clear cut process. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1678.56s)]
*  It's available to the White House right now. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1680.56s)]
*  If you find things that are odious in the federal payment system, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1683.52s)]
*  programs that could not withstand any kind of serious political scrutiny [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1687.04s)]
*  from Republicans or Democrats, but since you're the majority party, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1691.36s)]
*  just from Republicans, federal funding ends mid-March. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1694.72s)]
*  That's when it expires, which means you need to have an appropriations bill [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1700.0800000000002s)]
*  to fund the government for the rest of this fiscal year. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1703.6000000000001s)]
*  Why don't you put that on a list, send it to Congress and say, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1706.0800000000002s)]
*  get rid of those things? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1709.2800000000002s)]
*  You don't think the Republicans in Congress would vote to get rid of those things [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1710.5600000000002s)]
*  that can't withstand political scrutiny? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1713.92s)]
*  I'm pretty confident they would. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1716.3200000000002s)]
*  That's the actual process. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1717.68s)]
*  That's what federal judges are saying. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1718.88s)]
*  Congress appropriated this money. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1721.2s)]
*  If you disagree with that, go back to Congress, have them rescind it, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1722.72s)]
*  and the problem is solved. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1726.24s)]
*  If you want to operate within the Constitution [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1727.84s)]
*  and the normal protocol of spending and decision-making, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1730.32s)]
*  whether this White House will avail themselves [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1734.56s)]
*  of that perfect and clarifying opportunity, I don't know. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1737.28s)]
*  The president's comments suggest possibly otherwise. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1740.88s)]
*  We have less than a minute, Major, but we did hear Elon Musk say [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1744.16s)]
*  that his goal is moving people from low productivity to high productivity jobs, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1747.1200000000001s)]
*  so everyone has a higher standard of living. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1750.96s)]
*  I think, per your point and the results of the election, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1753.8400000000001s)]
*  that Americans are looking for major reform and change. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1756.4s)]
*  But I suppose it's not necessarily the overwhelming mandate [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1760.88s)]
*  that they like to say that the popular vote margins were pretty slim. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1764.56s)]
*  They were, but Elon Musk talked about this mine shaft in Pennsylvania [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1768.16s)]
*  in which paper records are stored for federal retirees. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1772.8s)]
*  Might there be a better way of doing that? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1775.8400000000001s)]
*  There probably is. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1777.2s)]
*  Why don't we look at that, but do it within the system? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1778.16s)]
*  Ask Congress to change it? I bet it will. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1780.56s)]
*  All right, Major Garrett, thank you so much. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyqB3t91quQ&t=1783.04s)]
