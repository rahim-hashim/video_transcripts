# What does TikTok's future look like under Trump administration?
**CBS News:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w)
*  I want to just we were talking about those executive actions and orders that will be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=0.0s)]
*  issued today that flurry of activity by the president. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=5.28s)]
*  They will sign some of them in front of this crowd. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=8.96s)]
*  And we just heard from Ed O'Keefe. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=11.4s)]
*  I want to go to congressional correspondent Nicole Killian because she's on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=12.4s)]
*  And of course, one of the other big stories involves TikTok. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=17.04s)]
*  What do we know about that, Nicole? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=21.32s)]
*  Because just to remind everybody, this ban on TikTok, the required divestiture was passed [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=23.28s)]
*  by Congress, signed in bipartisan way, signed by President Biden. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=29.54s)]
*  And now Donald Trump says he wants to undo that. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=33.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. And soon after he is sworn in here at the Capitol, President-elect Trump [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=37.06s)]
*  says he intends to issue that executive order to prevent the TikTok ban from taking place. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=41.14s)]
*  Of course, a lot of users were surprised to get those notifications over the weekend saying [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=47.14s)]
*  that the service was not available only to find out a couple of hours later that service [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=51.019999999999996s)]
*  was restored. TikTok putting out a statement thanking, quote, the efforts of President Trump. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=55.34s)]
*  And of course, the president-elect has said that this executive order would basically extend [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=60.940000000000005s)]
*  the period of time before the law's prohibitions take place. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=65.58s)]
*  And so, as you mentioned, of course, that law passed by Congress just last year that would require [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=69.22s)]
*  TikTok to be sold off by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, in order to keep operating. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=74.06s)]
*  Now, President-elect says that he prefers to see some type of joint venture where a U.S. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=79.82000000000001s)]
*  entity would get a 50 percent ownership stake in some potential deal. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=84.62s)]
*  But that remains to be seen. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=89.46000000000001s)]
*  In the meantime, there are a number of congressional Republicans who believe that the law should stand [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=91.42s)]
*  as is, particularly because Congress passed it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=98.06s)]
*  It's been upheld by the Supreme Court. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=100.82000000000001s)]
*  But the president-elect is still moving forward today with that executive order. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=103.26s)]
*  And worth noting that TikTok CEO Xiao Chu is expected to be here for the inauguration. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=107.06s)]
*  Nicole Killian, thank you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=112.1s)]
*  We're going to keep talking about these executive orders, but I just have to pause for a moment [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=115.17999999999999s)]
*  because Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton has issued a very stern warning after this and has said [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=120.17999999999999s)]
*  that any company that hosts, distributes services or otherwise facilitates the communist-controlled [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=127.3s)]
*  TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=133.5s)]
*  So we see someone who is clearly in the MAGA camp rebuking those companies, warning them [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=140.3s)]
*  that they should not put TikTok back up. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=147.74s)]
*  And at the same time, there are a lot of concerns out there as well about what does this mean [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=150.62s)]
*  if a president can, with the stroke of a pen, undo what has been passed by a bipartisan [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=154.98000000000002s)]
*  Congress and upheld by the Supreme Court? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=159.66000000000003s)]
*  I may ask Senator Blunt about that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=161.74s)]
*  I think that circumstance, it could be a huge problem. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=163.66000000000003s)]
*  I wasn't in the Senate the last two years, so I haven't read the law carefully. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=168.06s)]
*  I heard yesterday that if there is a viable purchase in place, the president has some [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=172.06s)]
*  power under the law to suspend the law. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=179.54000000000002s)]
*  Otherwise, I don't know how you suspend the law. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=182.46s)]
*  It's passed by the Congress, signed by the president, the law of the country, though [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=184.74s)]
*  there may be this viable purchase option and maybe he decides there is one. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=188.22s)]
*  Tom Cotton's position, who is the head of the Senate Intel Committee, is that that law [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=193.74s)]
*  would mean that 90-day extension would have been required to have viable and significant [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=198.98s)]
*  progress on a deal prior to January 19th. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=204.06s)]
*  And that's where the stickiness is now. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=207.82s)]
*  We're now past that, and he's trying to invoke a 90-day extension, also saying he wants to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=209.62s)]
*  joint venture with the government of China, which I believe is not legal, but maybe trying [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  to gesture to what China does. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=219.7s)]
*  I sat by Tom Cotton for four years on the Intel Committee. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=221.74s)]
*  He's not to be trifled with. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=224.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=225.78s)]
*  He's definitely a hunk. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=226.78s)]
*  Let me ask you a question, Senator, about these executive orders more broadly. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=229.26000000000002s)]
*  It's the theme of the day. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=232.70000000000002s)]
*  It's certainly the theme of the beginning of the Trump administration. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=233.74s)]
*  Mike Lee once said about executive orders, the president is not a king. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=236.06s)]
*  There was a period where Republican senators in particular did not like executive orders. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=239.82000000000002s)]
*  Help us understand how you see those in the context of a government that was built with [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=244.54000000000002s)]
*  checks and balances between the power of the presidency and the power of Congress. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=249.58s)]
*  Well, what presidents mostly do now is they reverse the last executive orders. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=253.42000000000002s)]
*  So you could argue they're trying to get back to where it was before the other person issued [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=258.3s)]
*  their executive orders. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=262.58000000000004s)]
*  I think it's a huge problem. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=263.66s)]
*  Every president starts the presidency in this same way. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=266.1s)]
*  This may be a little more dramatic than others. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=270.66s)]
*  I don't know, but they all started the same way. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=273.22s)]
*  Find out in some cases they don't have the power to do what they hope to do, just like [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=276.74s)]
*  President Biden did about student loans. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=280.86s)]
*  President Trump may find out the same thing about the 14th Amendment and birthright citizenship. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=284.66s)]
*  But we need to... [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=290.42s)]
*  One of the problems here is, John, like the Iranian agreement, it's only as good as the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=292.18s)]
*  president who is willing to support it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=298.22s)]
*  The presidents need to go to the... [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=301.14s)]
*  Make the effort to get the Congress to make this a permanent treaty, a permanent agreement [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=303.1s)]
*  about Paris climate. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=308.78000000000003s)]
*  If they can't do that, they should realize that we're moving forward here on shaky ground [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=310.62s)]
*  and whatever we do could be immediately changed by the next president. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=315.66s)]
*  And I'd like to see every president do a better job of getting permanently done what they [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=319.02s)]
*  think ought to be done, rather than temporarily done what they think should be done. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=324.02s)]
*  So, I understand why President Trump is doing this today, because he's reversing a lot of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=328.41999999999996s)]
*  things that President Biden did four years ago today. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=333.7s)]
*  Well, some of these go beyond that and are probably, like you just said, going to go [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=336.9s)]
*  to the Supreme Court, with the 14th Amendment and trying to end birthright citizenship, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=340.34s)]
*  which is what the government interprets as the Constitution saying those born on American [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=344.41999999999996s)]
*  soil are citizens at birth regardless of their parents' immigration status. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=348.73999999999995s)]
*  He says no longer the case. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=352.34s)]
*  That raises a lot of practical questions about what does that mean for people currently in [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=353.58s)]
*  that status and then those coming here. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=357.74s)]
*  Also, I would flag for that executive order trying to end asylum by decree. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=360.18s)]
*  Asylum under international law is a human right that you can flee persecution and come [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=365.22s)]
*  and ask for it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=370.06s)]
*  We have seen President Biden test that with that executive order that he just put in place [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=371.06s)]
*  right before the election to try to drive down those crossing the border. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=376.78000000000003s)]
*  That's already in the courts. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=381.18s)]
*  So, that is already being pressed. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=382.58s)]
*  People trying to today end asylum by decree would say, if you were politically persecuted, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=384.82s)]
*  you are not welcome in the United States of America as a safe haven. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=389.7s)]
*  Of course, the problem is that over 90 percent of the people that claim asylum by decree [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=392.09999999999997s)]
*  don't get it when they go to court. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=396.46s)]
*  Under current law, which is why you'd go to Congress to change that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=397.9s)]
*  I understand. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=400.7s)]
*  To change that law. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69UaVvnm8w&t=401.7s)]
