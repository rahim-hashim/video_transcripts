# Why Americans are planning an "economic blackout" day
**CBS News:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4)
*  February 28th, the 24-hour economic blackout. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=0.0s)]
*  No Amazon, no Walmart, no fast food, no gas, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=4.32s)]
*  not a single unnecessary dollar spent. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=8.44s)]
*  For one day, we are going to finally turn the tables. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Maybe you've seen segments like this on your social feeds. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=16.56s)]
*  This call for an economic blackout has been spreading [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=19.36s)]
*  and activists are urging Americans to refrain [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=23.2s)]
*  from making any purchases [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=25.62s)]
*  at major retailers tomorrow on Friday. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=27.4s)]
*  The nationwide protest comes as people continue [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=30.08s)]
*  to endure rising prices on everything from food and gas [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=32.16s)]
*  to housing and utilities. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=35.28s)]
*  National Consumer Reporter for USA Today, Betty Lynn Fisher [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=36.96s)]
*  joins us now from Akron, Ohio [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=40.0s)]
*  to talk about what this all means. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=42.08s)]
*  So fill us in, what is the purpose [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=44.32s)]
*  specifically of this blackout? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=46.64s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=49.16s)]
*  So, you know, this started out as you just saw the video [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=50.0s)]
*  of John Schwartz who goes by the one called Jay on Instagram [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  and he says that it just started as a bold idea [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=55.8s)]
*  where he was frustrated and wanted to have consumers [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=59.04s)]
*  take back a day and, you know, take a day starting tomorrow [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=63.8s)]
*  after midnight and for 24 hours not to shop [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=68.88s)]
*  or spend any money anywhere in person or online [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=71.72s)]
*  to just try to make an impact [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=76.4s)]
*  on what he calls corporate greed. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=77.84s)]
*  Is there any hint or evidence [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=80.32s)]
*  as to how much this is catching on [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  and which companies, we heard him mention some of them, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  but which ones are being targeted [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=89.04s)]
*  and why this date of February 28th? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=90.76s)]
*  Yeah, I think, you know, I think he just came up with a date [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  when he was coming up with this bold idea [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=95.76s)]
*  for one day to start with. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  It does seem that this, you know, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=100.2s)]
*  has become kind of a viral social media movement. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=102.36s)]
*  There has been a lot of people posting. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=106.08s)]
*  There are also, in addition to this, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=109.88s)]
*  this is the People's Union is John Schwartz's group. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=112.44s)]
*  This is kind of their initial one-day boycott. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=115.12s)]
*  They have since expanded [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=118.76s)]
*  and they'll be doing some other events too. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=120.92s)]
*  So for tomorrow, there's not any specific company [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  that is targeted. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=128.28s)]
*  They have mentioned companies like Target [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=129.20000000000002s)]
*  and Walmart and Amazon, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=131.88s)]
*  but the idea is not to spend money anywhere. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=133.24s)]
*  But then there are other efforts by the People's Union [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=135.96s)]
*  as well as other organizations [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=138.24s)]
*  that have been upset with companies [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=140.6s)]
*  such as Target and Walmart and Amazon [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=143.36s)]
*  that have rolled back their diversity, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=145.88000000000002s)]
*  equity and inclusion efforts, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=148.08s)]
*  as well as President Trump's elimination [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=149.4s)]
*  of federal DEI programs since taking office. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=151.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's something I had seen over the past month [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=154.68s)]
*  as people voicing ways that they could show frustration [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=157.08s)]
*  from DEI policies being rolled back. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=160.68s)]
*  Is this likely to have an impact on the economy though? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=165.68s)]
*  I mean, one single day of buying things you don't need [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=168.0s)]
*  could be supplemented by buying them on Saturday. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=170.6s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=173.96s)]
*  You know, it remains to be seen. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=174.8s)]
*  I think that it's hard to know whether or not [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=176.68s)]
*  there really is gonna be something quantifiable [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=178.8s)]
*  to show data that one day has made an impact [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=180.84s)]
*  or like you said, that people aren't buying today [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=184.36s)]
*  or aren't buying on Saturday. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=186.32s)]
*  There are other efforts by this group and others [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=188.08s)]
*  to expand their boycotts to week long or month long. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=190.88s)]
*  There are some that are right now [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=195.48000000000002s)]
*  indefinitely boycotting Target. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=196.76s)]
*  There is a call by the religious community [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  to start on Ash Wednesday, March 5th, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  a 40 day fast of Target, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=205.32s)]
*  also to protest the DEI initiatives. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=207.23999999999998s)]
*  Interesting, people trying to figure out different ways [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=211.28s)]
*  of getting their messages heard. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=213.68s)]
*  Betty Lynn Fisher, great to chat with you about this. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  Appreciate you waking up with us. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=217.72s)]
*  Thank you, thanks. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf0j92eyhu4&t=218.56s)]
