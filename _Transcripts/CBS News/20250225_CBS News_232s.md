# Musk doubles down on email from federal employees, Trump backs him up
**CBS News:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0)
*  Federal workers across the country [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=0.0s)]
*  are experiencing confusion this morning [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=1.8s)]
*  after the Office of Personnel Management [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=4.28s)]
*  said each agency can decide how to respond [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=6.76s)]
*  to an email demanding information on what [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=9.72s)]
*  work they had performed. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=12.56s)]
*  Originally, last night was the deadline for a reply [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=14.36s)]
*  from all of them. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=17.6s)]
*  But earlier, Elon Musk appeared to extend that deadline, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=18.64s)]
*  saying workers would get another chance to respond, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=21.8s)]
*  but could still be fired. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=24.76s)]
*  President Trump was asked about the email yesterday [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=26.72s)]
*  at the White House, and he is supporting Musk's actions. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=29.08s)]
*  And then if you don't answer, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=33.36s)]
*  like you're sort of semi-fired or you're fired. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=35.16s)]
*  CBS News correspondent, Natalie Brand, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=39.76s)]
*  joins us from the White House with more on this. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=41.6s)]
*  Natalie, how are individual agencies handling [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=43.96s)]
*  this complication over how to reply to Musk's demands? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=46.92s)]
*  Good morning, Errol. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=52.92s)]
*  Yeah, as you kind of outlined, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=53.76s)]
*  there's a lot of mixed messages here, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=55.06s)]
*  but what CBS News has learned is in this call [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=57.2s)]
*  between the Office of Personnel Management [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=60.24s)]
*  and then also agency leaders and HR personnel, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=63.24s)]
*  basically the message was it's up to individual agencies [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=68.28s)]
*  on how to respond or how they would like employees [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=72.48s)]
*  to respond. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  And this follows, as we discussed yesterday, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=77.64s)]
*  a lot of pushback from some of these agency leaders, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=79.64s)]
*  essentially telling their employees to hold off [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=83.72s)]
*  on replying to that email for now. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=86.84s)]
*  The list of those agencies grew yesterday, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=89.76s)]
*  and CBS News tracking them learned the Justice Department, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=93.08s)]
*  the FBI, the State Department, the Pentagon, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  the Department of Energy, DHS, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=99.76s)]
*  and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=101.76s)]
*  all told employees to hold off. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=104.36s)]
*  Those agencies, obviously, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=106.84s)]
*  dealing with law enforcement and national security. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  On the other hand, you had other agencies telling employees [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  to go ahead and respond. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=114.76s)]
*  That included, from what we've learned, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=116.58s)]
*  the Department of Transportation, Education, Commerce, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=118.5s)]
*  the NTSB, and also some employees [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=122.22s)]
*  with the National Park Service. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=125.34s)]
*  Now, what's interesting is in a new OPM memo last night, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=127.5s)]
*  again, it told the agencies decide [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=134.22s)]
*  how you'd like to handle this, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=136.3s)]
*  but suggested that perhaps this weekly list [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=137.7s)]
*  of accomplishments could be part of a weekly activity report. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=143.06s)]
*  So, you have on the one hand them [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=147.57999999999998s)]
*  in kind of doubling down on this idea, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=150.14s)]
*  and on the other hand, leaving it up to these agencies. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=152.66s)]
*  And then as you noted, you have this new tweet last night [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=156.38s)]
*  from Elon Musk giving employees, he says, a second chance, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=159.57999999999998s)]
*  or else they could face termination. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=163.33999999999997s)]
*  But, Errol, one of the big employee unions [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=165.76s)]
*  for federal workers said, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=169.12s)]
*  employees report to their agencies [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=171.46s)]
*  through specific chains of command, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=174.58s)]
*  not to the Office of Personnel Management, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=177.06s)]
*  or DOGE, or Elon Musk. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=180.22s)]
*  And, Natalie, we saw Musk also say [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=182.66s)]
*  that he was just trying to see who replies to email [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=184.7s)]
*  to make sure that these agencies have a pulse, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=187.22s)]
*  which is very eye-opening. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=190.1s)]
*  Do we know what might happen with the responses [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=191.26s)]
*  that have already been sent? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=194.54s)]
*  Yeah, well, according to sources [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=196.72s)]
*  who kind of briefed us on this phone call last night, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=199.36s)]
*  employees who have already responded, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=202.44s)]
*  they said really nothing would be done with that information, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=205.56s)]
*  which again, begs the question [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=208.96s)]
*  of why this exercise was initiated in the first place. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=211.64s)]
*  But again, the bottom line here is, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=215.44s)]
*  it seems like the administration now giving deference [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=217.72s)]
*  to these agency heads, which a lot of legal experts [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=221.48s)]
*  have said that is the way to go here. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=224.8s)]
*  All right, Natalie Brandt at the White House. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=229.68s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tynAVDtdsh0&t=231.32s)]
