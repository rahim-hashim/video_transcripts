*  talk coherently, but I can [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=52.08s)]
*  explain. I was in the house. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=57.0s)]
*  We were in the house. We were [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  in the house. We were the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  agents or house and policemen [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=62.48s)]

*  told us. If I could wait your [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=66.32s)]
*  property as soon as you can. It [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=68.32s)]
*  was Tuesday 6 30 p.m. And I [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=72.12s)]
*  helped my daughter and my [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=74.52s)]
*  husband to evacuate the place [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=76.12s)]
*  as soon as they can. But I [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=79.16s)]
*  promised to them I'm going to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=81.19999999999999s)]
*  stay and I will save the house [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=82.75999999999999s)]
*  because I was watering, hosing [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=86.28s)]
*  down the property hillside and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=89.16s)]
*  the whole structure with the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=91.76s)]
*  four inches pipe that our [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=94.36s)]
*  neighbor provided us and gave [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=96.76s)]
*  it to me. And I was watering [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=98.76s)]
*  it and hosing down all the area. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=101.16s)]
*  It was completely wet. I knew [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=103.56s)]
*  there is no water. There is no [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  fire can penetrate to this [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=108.56s)]
*  area. I was doing this. The [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  fire department, the firefighter [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=113.36s)]
*  told me you have to leave now. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=114.96s)]
*  I said my husband and my [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  daughters are gone. And then [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  they told me you have to leave [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  it now. And I stayed there until [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=124.36s)]
*  the water hose still was running. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=127.96s)]
*  Then firefighter three hours [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=130.76s)]
*  later came to my house again and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=132.76s)]
*  told me you have to leave. I [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=134.35999999999999s)]
*  said I can't. He said I'm going [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  to save your house and your [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  property and your business, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=139.56s)]
*  everything. And I said, OK, I [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=140.95999999999998s)]
*  can help you. He said, no, you [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=144.56s)]
*  can't. The fire is too hot and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=145.96s)]
*  you're going to burn. And I [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=147.96s)]
*  continue watering it. I noticed [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=149.96s)]
*  suddenly the valve is off. I [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=152.16s)]
*  said, what's going on? I saw [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=155.96s)]
*  the fire. I saw the firefighter [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=157.96s)]
*  was inside the neighbor house [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=161.56s)]
*  and was shutting down the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=163.76s)]
*  valves which was giving me [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=166.16s)]
*  water. And at that time it was [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=168.36s)]
*  almost 12 at night and I just [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=171.16s)]
*  left the property. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=173.76s)]
*  I know it's really, really [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  difficult. Thank you for sharing [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  that. I know you've lost [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  everything and I'm so sorry. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=178.85999999999999s)]
*  I wanted to speak with your [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=180.76s)]
*  husband, Majid, if I could. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=182.16s)]
*  And I know you told me that you [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  have insurance through the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  California Fair Plan. You've [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  already logged online, but [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=188.45999999999998s)]
*  you're actually extremely [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=189.85999999999999s)]
*  concerned about what happens [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=191.06s)]
*  next. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=192.26s)]
*  Yes, I've already filed the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=193.56s)]
*  claim, but my concern is that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  from what I heard on the Fox [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=197.85999999999999s)]
*  News, the exposure from [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=199.85999999999999s)]
*  California Fair Plan for as of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=200.85999999999999s)]
*  September was $460 billion, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=204.26s)]
*  but their cash on hand is only [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=206.66s)]
*  $700 million. So that doesn't [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=209.45999999999998s)]
*  leave much hope for thousands [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=212.26s)]
*  of people who have California [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=214.66s)]
*  Fair Plan. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=217.06s)]
*  And you told me that, you know, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=218.06s)]
*  to rebuild like you would like [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=219.26s)]
*  to rebuild, but you're concerned [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=220.26s)]
*  that you're just not the payout [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=221.66s)]
*  won't be enough for that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=222.85999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the payout is not enough [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=224.26s)]
*  for that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=226.26s)]
*  Yeah, the insurance policy from [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=227.26s)]
*  California Fair Plan is not [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=228.85999999999999s)]
*  replacement cost. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=230.45999999999998s)]
*  And today's high cost is probably [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=232.45999999999998s)]
*  not going to be enough to build [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=237.26s)]
*  what it was there. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=239.06s)]
*  And I thank you for talking with [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=240.26s)]
*  me. I know you were actually [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=241.45999999999998s)]
*  falling asleep earlier as you [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=242.66s)]
*  were just standing here. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=244.06s)]
*  It's been such a difficult [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=246.26s)]
*  journey for you and your family, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=247.85999999999999s)]
*  having lost everything. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=249.66s)]
*  Yes, and we have vacated twice [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=251.45999999999998s)]
*  from two different shelters. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=254.45999999999998s)]
*  Because we like it to Circle [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=256.06s)]
*  View over there, also Valley [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=258.46s)]
*  Circle, and there was a fire [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=260.86s)]
*  nearby there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=262.66s)]
*  So we had to evacuate that one [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=263.66s)]
*  and then came to this one, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=265.86s)]
*  which is Westwood Shelter. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=267.26s)]
*  And if I can, Rudabe and Jamie, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=270.06s)]
*  I want to introduce you to their [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=272.46s)]
*  daughter, Resvan. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=274.66s)]
*  Hi, Resvan. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=276.46s)]
*  I know that you are going to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=278.06s)]
*  introduce me to someone very [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=279.66s)]
*  special. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=281.06s)]
*  Yeah, so basically this is my [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=282.26s)]
*  pet, Coco. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=285.66s)]
*  She got traumatized by the fire. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=288.26000000000005s)]
*  She lost her house in her [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=291.26000000000005s)]
*  comfortable home, and it's been [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=292.46000000000004s)]
*  really hard on her. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=294.06s)]
*  She also has separation anxiety. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=295.06s)]
*  So when we were trying to get [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=297.66s)]
*  her to assimilate into the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=300.26000000000005s)]
*  shelter life and sleep in a cage [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=301.86s)]
*  with other pets, even though [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=304.26000000000005s)]
*  they were closed off, she [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=305.86s)]
*  couldn't deal with it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=307.06s)]
*  She started shaking, and we were [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=308.06s)]
*  afraid that since she's senile, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=309.26000000000005s)]
*  she might have a heart attack or [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=311.26000000000005s)]
*  something. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=312.66s)]
*  So we brought her back here. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=313.06s)]
*  And now she's a little bit more [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=314.26s)]
*  happy, but she slowly... [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=315.86s)]
*  At first, we had to force feed [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=318.26s)]
*  her because she wouldn't even [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=319.65999999999997s)]
*  accept food, and we tried to [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=320.65999999999997s)]
*  drop her off at the Agoura Hills [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=321.86s)]
*  Animal Shelter, which, you know, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=323.86s)]
*  there was plenty of room for her [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=325.86s)]
*  and food, and it seemed like it [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=327.06s)]
*  was a safe environment, but she [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=328.65999999999997s)]
*  couldn't take it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=331.26s)]
*  She just... [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=332.26s)]
*  She was just sitting in a corner [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=333.06s)]
*  and, like, shaking and bang. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=334.86s)]
*  So we got her and we brought her [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=336.65999999999997s)]
*  here, and now she's with us and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=338.65999999999997s)]
*  she's happy. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=340.06s)]
*  But we have to sleep in the car [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=340.65999999999997s)]
*  every single night. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=343.06s)]
*  Because Coco cannot sleep on her [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=344.06s)]
*  own. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=346.46s)]
*  And it's just really stressful. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=347.06s)]
*  Like, Coco's not happy, but if [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=350.46s)]
*  you're willing to... [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=353.26s)]
*  If you like Coco, you should [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=354.86s)]
*  follow her on Instagram. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=357.26s)]
*  Her Instagram is coco.the.goat. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=358.46s)]
*  I think everybody's going to do [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=361.26s)]
*  that right now because we love [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=363.46s)]
*  Coco, and I can't believe you [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=364.66s)]
*  guys have been sleeping in your [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=366.06s)]
*  car. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=368.26s)]
*  That's so tough, and I know your [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=368.66s)]
*  dad isn't getting the proper [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=369.46s)]
*  amount of sleep. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=371.06s)]
*  My final question before you go, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=371.66s)]
*  before a young person to be [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=373.26s)]
*  going through this, I know your [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=374.65999999999997s)]
*  mom was telling me you're... [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=375.86s)]
*  Coco's eating my notes. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=377.06s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=378.86s)]
*  Oh, no, it's okay. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=379.86s)]
*  Is that... [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=381.26s)]
*  I hope that's okay to eat paper. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=381.86s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=383.65999999999997s)]
*  It's not cellulose. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=384.46s)]
*  It doesn't really affect them [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=385.46s)]
*  badly, but they shouldn't eat [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=386.46s)]
*  it because it's just like, you [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=388.65999999999997s)]
*  know, it's like empty calories [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=389.65999999999997s)]
*  for them. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=391.86s)]
*  Okay, yeah. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=392.26s)]
*  And I guess my final question [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=392.86s)]
*  was for a young person to go [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=394.65999999999997s)]
*  through this, how are you [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=395.86s)]
*  holding up? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=396.86s)]
*  I'm... [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=397.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, so I'm just trying not [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=399.06s)]
*  to think about it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=401.26s)]
*  You know, when it first [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=402.06s)]
*  happened, I was... [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=403.26s)]
*  I didn't even process it, and [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=405.66s)]
*  then all of a sudden, like, five [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=407.26s)]
*  hours later, it hit me when I [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=408.66s)]
*  was like, oh, but everything's [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=410.66s)]
*  going to be okay after a few [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=411.66s)]
*  days. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=412.86s)]
*  Like, we're just going to go [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=413.26s)]
*  home. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=414.26s)]
*  And then I was like, there is [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=414.66s)]
*  no home. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=415.86s)]
*  It sucks, but like, I mean, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=417.46s)]
*  it's worse for Coco, so, you [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=419.26s)]
*  know, it's just like whatever. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=421.46s)]
*  I'm so sorry that this has [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=425.46s)]
*  happened, and I know you've lost [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=426.86s)]
*  everything, and I know that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=428.46s)]
*  you're an artist, and that's, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=429.46s)]
*  like, a way that you get [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=430.66s)]
*  relief, and your mom was [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=432.06s)]
*  telling me that you've lost, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=433.06s)]
*  you know, all of that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=434.46000000000004s)]
*  Is there anything else in your [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=435.66s)]
*  heart? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=436.46000000000004s)]
*  Is there anything else that [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=436.86s)]
*  you want to say? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=437.46000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I've lost, like, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=438.86s)]
*  everything that I've made. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=440.46000000000004s)]
*  I've lost all of my art [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=441.86s)]
*  supplies. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=443.06s)]
*  I've lost, like, everything [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=445.26000000000005s)]
*  that I've collected over the [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=446.46000000000004s)]
*  years. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=447.86s)]
*  Only, like, one thing stays... [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=449.06s)]
*  I mean, only, like... [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=451.46000000000004s)]
*  So I've saved two art pieces, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=453.16s)]
*  and then this one trinket [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=456.26000000000005s)]
*  follows me everywhere I go. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=457.86s)]
*  I don't know what it is about [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=459.46000000000004s)]
*  this trinket, but I still have [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=460.56s)]
*  that thing, and, like, that's [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=462.16s)]
*  about it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=465.16s)]
*  I don't have anything else. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=465.76s)]
*  Like, I don't have any clothes [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=466.76s)]
*  other than the clothes that I [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=468.16s)]
*  got at the shelter and the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=469.36s)]
*  clothes that were on my body at [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjoqGwuGM4&t=471.56s)]
