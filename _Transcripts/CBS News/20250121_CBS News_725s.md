# Trump announces $500 billion AI infrastructure project
**CBS News:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68)
*  Well, thank you very much. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=0.0s)]
*  And it's an honor to be here today. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=4.76s)]
*  We have first full day as president. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=7.04s)]
*  We're back. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=11.48s)]
*  And we had a great first term, but we're going to have an even better second term. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=13.4s)]
*  And I think we're going to do things that people will be shocked at. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=18.28s)]
*  We're starting off with tremendous investment coming into our country at levels that nobody's [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=22.72s)]
*  really ever seen before. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=29.32s)]
*  And they're very happy with the fact that I won the race and that they feel confident [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=30.56s)]
*  in their investments. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=37.72s)]
*  And it's big money and high quality people. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=38.72s)]
*  So my first day back from from having a nice life, it's my honor to welcome three of the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=42.68s)]
*  world's leading technology CEOs. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=50.2s)]
*  In the case of Larry, Larry Ellison, it's well beyond technology, sort of CEO of everything. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=53.16s)]
*  He's an amazing man and amazing business person. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=61.12s)]
*  But to announce the largest infrastructure project by far in history, and it's all taking [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=65.88s)]
*  place right here in America. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=71.72s)]
*  As you know, there's great competition for AI and other things, and they're coming in [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=75.8s)]
*  at the highest level. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=82.32s)]
*  We're joined by Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison, Softbank CEO, my friend Masa, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=83.32s)]
*  Masa Yoshison, and CEO of OpenAI and I would say the by far the leading expert based on [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=92.0s)]
*  everything I read, Sam Altman. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  So that's great that you're coming in together. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=105.6s)]
*  That's a massive group of talent and money. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=108.83999999999999s)]
*  Together, these world leading technology giants are announcing the formation of Stargate. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=112.28s)]
*  So put that name down in your books, because I think you're going to hear a lot about it [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  in the future. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=123.8s)]
*  A new American company that will invest $500 billion at least in AI infrastructure in the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=124.8s)]
*  United States and move and very, very quickly moving very rapidly, creating over 100,000 [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=131.28s)]
*  American jobs almost immediately. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=137.76s)]
*  This monumental undertaking is a resounding declaration of confidence in America's potential [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=140.4s)]
*  under a new president. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=146.4s)]
*  Let me be a new president. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=149.32s)]
*  I didn't say it, they did. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=151.4s)]
*  So I appreciate that fellas, but it'll ensure the future of technology. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=153.56s)]
*  What we want to do is we want to keep it in this country. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=158.84s)]
*  China is a competitor and others are competitors. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=161.4s)]
*  We want it to be in this country and we're making it available. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=165.08s)]
*  I'm going to help a lot through emergency declarations because we have an emergency. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=169.52s)]
*  We have to get this stuff built. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  So they have to produce a lot of electricity and we'll make it possible for them to get [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=177.60000000000002s)]
*  that production done very easily at their own plants if they want, where they'll build [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=182.56s)]
*  at the plant, the AI plant, they'll build energy generation and that will be incredible. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=188.56s)]
*  And it's technology and artificial intelligence all made in the USA. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=198.08s)]
*  Begin immediately Stargate will be building the physical and virtual infrastructure to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  power the next generation of advancements in AI and this will include the construction [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=208.04000000000002s)]
*  of colossal data centers, very, very massive structures. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=213.68s)]
*  I was in the real estate business. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=218.84s)]
*  These buildings, these are big, beautiful buildings are going to employ a lot of people [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  and physical campuses and locations currently being scouted nationwide. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=224.64s)]
*  They're making their choices of locations. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=228.72s)]
*  I think they have their choice. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=230.88s)]
*  I'd like to ask Larry, Sam and Masa to say a few words and just talk about a little bit [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=233.23999999999998s)]
*  about what they're doing. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  And if you have any questions and then we'll go into a couple of other subjects also. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=241.39999999999998s)]
*  But this is to me a very big thing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=246.39999999999998s)]
*  $500 billion Stargate project. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=249.2s)]
*  I think it's going to be something that's very special. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=252.92s)]
*  It'll lead to something that could be the biggest of all. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=255.24s)]
*  So Larry, maybe we'll start with you and we'll go down the line. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=259.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=263.2s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=264.2s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=269.2s)]
*  We certainly couldn't do this without you. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=270.2s)]
*  It would simply be impossible. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=272.08s)]
*  AI holds incredible promise for all of us, for every American. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=275.4s)]
*  We've actually been working with OpenAI for a while and with Masa for a while. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=281.2s)]
*  The data centers are actually under construction. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=286.04s)]
*  The first of them are under construction in Texas. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=288.44s)]
*  Each building is a half a million square feet. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=291.0s)]
*  There are 10 buildings currently being built, but that will expand to 20 and other locations [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=293.36s)]
*  beyond the Abilene location, which is our first location. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=299.0s)]
*  The kind of applications that we're building to give you an idea, maybe the most charismatic [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=303.84s)]
*  and the one that I think touches us all, is electronic health records, not just maintaining [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=308.96s)]
*  electronic health records, but by looking at electronic health records, understanding [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=316.68s)]
*  the condition of the doctors, better understanding the condition of their patients, and being [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=321.36s)]
*  able to provide health care plans that are much better than the otherwise would be. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=325.92s)]
*  A doctor in Indian River Reservation would be able to see how a doctor at Memorial Sloan [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=330.56s)]
*  Kettering would treat the patient, or a doctor at Stanford would treat the patient. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=337.92s)]
*  We actually provide all of that information, all of that guidance to the doctors who are [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  treating cancer patients or patients with any other kind of disease made possible by AI. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=350.56s)]
*  I'm not going to take a lot of time. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=356.4s)]
*  I'm going to pass it to Masa, but this is a very exciting program for Oracle to be a [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=358.04s)]
*  part of. Thank you. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=361.8s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=362.8s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=367.8s)]
*  That was good. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=368.8s)]
*  That's good. That's great. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=370.8s)]
*  I feel tall now. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=373.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=378.36s)]
*  Well, Mr. President, last month I came to celebrate your winning and promised that you [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=379.36s)]
*  would invest $100 billion. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=388.56s)]
*  And you told me, oh, Masa, go for $200. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=390.56s)]
*  Now I came back with $500. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=394.56s)]
*  Because this is the, as you said yesterday, this is the beginning of the golden age of [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=398.56s)]
*  America. This is one great example, I think. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=409.84s)]
*  Right? We wouldn't have decided to do this. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=413.92s)]
*  This is the beginning of golden age. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=417.35999999999996s)]
*  We wouldn't have decided unless you won. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=419.52s)]
*  And yesterday we agreed, we signed to make this happen. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=422.96s)]
*  Because of this day. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=428.96s)]
*  So we would make this happen. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=432.23999999999995s)]
*  We would immediately start deploying $100 billion with the goal of making $500 billion [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=436.23999999999995s)]
*  within the next four years, within your time. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=444.32s)]
*  Right? Because of your success. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=448.56s)]
*  So we are very, very excited to do this. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=452.16s)]
*  And our partner is, of course, Softbank, OpenAI, Oracle, and an additional investing partner [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=455.92s)]
*  with MGX. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=465.12s)]
*  On top of that, we have the technology partner, Nvidia. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=468.0s)]
*  And of course, Microsoft has been very, very supportive to SAM and continue to support [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=472.71999999999997s)]
*  all our success. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=479.59999999999997s)]
*  This is not just for business. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=482.08s)]
*  As Larry said, this will help people's life. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  This will help solving many, many issues, difficult things that otherwise we could not [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=489.12s)]
*  have solved with the power of AI. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=496.88s)]
*  I think AGI is coming very, very soon. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=500.71999999999997s)]
*  And after that, that's not the goal. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=504.96s)]
*  After that, artificial super intelligence will come to solve the issues that mankind [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=507.36s)]
*  would never, ever have thought that we could solve. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=514.64s)]
*  Well, this is the beginning of our golden age. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=518.88s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=524.3199999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=525.04s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=525.92s)]
*  Sam? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=526.88s)]
*  I don't have too much to add, but I do want to say I'm thrilled we get to do this in the [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=527.38s)]
*  United States of America. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=533.06s)]
*  I think this will be the most important project of this era. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=534.26s)]
*  And as Masa said, for AGI to get built here, to create hundreds of thousands of jobs, to [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=537.14s)]
*  create a new industry centered here, we wouldn't be able to do this without you, Mr. President. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=541.86s)]
*  And I'm thrilled that we get to. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=546.26s)]
*  I think it'll be an exciting project. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=547.86s)]
*  I think we'll be able to do all of the wonderful things that these guys talked about. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=550.1s)]
*  But the fact that we get to do this in the United States is, I think, wonderful. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=553.86s)]
*  So thank you very much. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=558.34s)]
*  Can you just say one word? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=559.62s)]
*  I hear so many positive things about what it's going to do for medical research and [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=561.22s)]
*  for solving things, cancer and all the different problems. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=566.9s)]
*  How will AI help us with the fight against the various problems, diseases, etc.? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=570.74s)]
*  These guys can maybe share more about some of the work they're doing there. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=578.5s)]
*  I think they'll jointly be some of the leaders about driving progress here. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=581.46s)]
*  But I believe that as this technology progresses, we will see diseases get [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=585.38s)]
*  cured at an unprecedented rate. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=589.9399999999999s)]
*  We will be amazed at how quickly we're curing this cancer and that one and heart disease [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=592.18s)]
*  and what this will do for the ability to deliver very high quality health care, the costs, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=596.98s)]
*  but really to cure the diseases at a rapid, rapid rate, I think will be [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=602.42s)]
*  among the most important things this technology does. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=607.94s)]
*  Very good. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=612.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=612.74s)]
*  Can I take an answer to that question? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=613.22s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=614.5s)]
*  So we're currently working on... [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=616.66s)]
*  Should I step on this? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=618.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=619.78s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=620.26s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=622.34s)]
*  I'm not that tall. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=623.54s)]
*  I'm not that tall. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=624.58s)]
*  I'm not that tall. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=625.22s)]
*  I'm not that tall. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=626.26s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=630.26s)]
*  One of the most exciting things we're working on, again, using the tools that Sam and Masa [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=631.9399999999999s)]
*  are providing, is a cancer vaccine. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=637.22s)]
*  It's very interesting. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=641.38s)]
*  Early... [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=643.14s)]
*  It turns out, I'll be quick, all of our cancers, cancer tumors, little fragments of those tumors [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=643.94s)]
*  float around in your blood. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=651.86s)]
*  So you can do early cancer detection. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=654.34s)]
*  You can do early cancer detection with a blood test and using AI to look at the blood test. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=657.86s)]
*  You can find the cancers that are actually seriously threatening the person. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=667.38s)]
*  So we can, again, cancer diagnosis using AI has the promise of just being a simple blood test. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=671.78s)]
*  Then beyond that, once we gene sequence, once we gene sequence that cancer tumor, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=679.14s)]
*  you can then vaccinate the person, design a vaccine for every individual person to [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=686.98s)]
*  vaccinate them against that cancer. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=694.02s)]
*  And you can make that vaccine, that mRNA vaccine, you can make that robotically, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=696.82s)]
*  again, using AI in about 48 hours. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=704.1800000000001s)]
*  So imagine early cancer detection, the development of a cancer vaccine for your particular cancer [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=706.74s)]
*  aimed at you and have that vaccine available in 48 hours. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=713.3800000000001s)]
*  This is the promise of AI and the promise of the future. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtqPEA2Z68&t=717.5400000000001s)]
