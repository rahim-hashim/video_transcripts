# Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage-release deal could be in place by weekend
**CBS News:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0)
*  U.S., Arab, and Israeli officials tell CBS News that Israel and Hamas have agreed in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=0.0s)]
*  principle to a ceasefire and hostage release draft deal. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=4.0600000000000005s)]
*  Negotiators are still working to hammer out the final details of that agreement in Qatar. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=7.62s)]
*  CBS News foreign correspondent Rami Nissencio is following the very latest from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=12.02s)]
*  Rami, could we finally get a deal? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=17.34s)]
*  That is the question on everyone's mind. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=21.22s)]
*  In short answer, that is where this very much appears to be headed. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=25.44s)]
*  The word that's on my mind is imminent. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=31.32s)]
*  That has been talked about over the past several hours since this morning. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  And CBS News has learned from two sources familiar with the details that Hamas has given [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=37.68s)]
*  the green light for this deal. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=43.46s)]
*  We got a short quote from those sources earlier saying that, quote, we are very close and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=45.660000000000004s)]
*  the target now is for an agreement today or tomorrow, maybe as early as tonight that that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=49.94s)]
*  deal will be signed. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=54.1s)]
*  And as we know, this would put at least a ceasefire, not an end, but a ceasefire to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=55.3s)]
*  now 466 days of war, the release of what we understand to be 98 Israeli hostages for hundreds [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=60.26s)]
*  of Palestinian detainees. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=66.46s)]
*  And that pause on the death toll that keeps rising in Gaza that's risen to nearly 47000 [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=68.12s)]
*  people. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=73.06s)]
*  And of course, that's according to the Hamas run health ministry. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=74.06s)]
*  But you know, glad across Israeli media, we're seeing a similar reporting is what we've got. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=76.06s)]
*  They're talking about a breakthrough, a quote there in talks in Doha, a meeting with Hamas [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=81.02s)]
*  leadership that ended when most disputes were resolved and that government meetings will [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  be held tomorrow. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=89.36s)]
*  If all this goes ahead, the agreement could be implemented by this weekend. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=90.36s)]
*  And I think the optics we're waiting to see, just like happened 13 months ago, is that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=94.0s)]
*  we could start to see the release at least of a handful of hostages this weekend. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=98.84s)]
*  And how, Remy, are loved ones of those being held by Hamas and Gaza reacting to the news [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=103.88s)]
*  that they may be finally getting closer to seeing their loved ones? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=108.24s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=113.38s)]
*  Vlad, I would I would describe this as an anxious hope that they're alive. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  But of course, the the anxious fear, I suppose that they're dead. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=120.97999999999999s)]
*  So many mothers, fathers, siblings, friends that we've talked to don't want to hope again. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=125.5s)]
*  And it's horrible really to say that. But in this case, in case this this falls apart, that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=130.62s)]
*  is their fear. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=135.38s)]
*  These talks since last summer have gone ahead and then collapsed. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=137.0s)]
*  And before the news broke this breakthrough, we have been talking to so many people. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=141.48s)]
*  We attended protests. We attended one silent protest in Jerusalem. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=146.72s)]
*  Families and friends of hostages there. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  One friend of one of the hostages, 28 year old Romy Gonen, who still is in Gaza, who is [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=151.84s)]
*  on that list of 33, by the way, that we've been talking about the past few days, told us [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=157.72s)]
*  about her anxiety. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=161.4s)]
*  Have a listen. This is her friend, Avital Lieberman. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=162.92s)]
*  I try to be very cautious and not get too excited because there have been lists before. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  We just keep hoping and then getting our hopes up and our hearts shatter. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=171.72s)]
*  So I try not to get too excited, but stay hopeful. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=176.56s)]
*  As long as it's not everyone, my heart will never be whole because we've all become one [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=180.16s)]
*  family and we want everyone to be home. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=186.24s)]
*  It's an amazing start and I think we should bring them home so that we can start bringing [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=188.48s)]
*  everybody home. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=192.56s)]
*  But it's it's just the beginning. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=194.0s)]
*  As you. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=196.04s)]
*  Yeah, the beginning, possibly the beginning of the end, but the end still could take many [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=197.9s)]
*  months, really. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=202.26s)]
*  We did speak to other families. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=203.26s)]
*  Cynicism of Hamas is what they're telling us that they're playing games. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=205.18s)]
*  But again, hope and we'll again get confirmation soon, perhaps in the next few hours this evening [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=208.54s)]
*  to see if that waiting for so many people here is finally over. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=213.34s)]
*  Would be remarkable, Remy, if that happens in the next couple of hours before President [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=217.01999999999998s)]
*  Biden delivers his final farewell address from the Oval Office. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=221.1s)]
*  We'll be watching all right, Remy, in a sense here for us in Tel Aviv. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=225.36s)]
*  Thank you, Remy. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8JNhb5QxM0&t=228.04s)]
