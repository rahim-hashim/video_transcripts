# Hegseth's blunt message on Ukraine's war with Russia
**CBS News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU)
*  Welcome back. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth delivered a blunt message during his visit [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=0.0s)]
*  to NATO headquarters today. He warned U.S. involvement in the war between Ukraine and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=5.24s)]
*  Russia will change under the Trump administration. Take a listen to some of those remarks. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=9.98s)]
*  We must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=15.92s)]
*  objective. The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=23.0s)]
*  outcome of a negotiated settlement. Instead, any security guarantee must be backed by capable [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=30.68s)]
*  European and non-European troops. If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=38.28s)]
*  at any point, they should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission and they should not [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  be covered under Article 5. There also must be robust international oversight of the line [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  of contact. To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  to Ukraine. The U.S. is prioritizing deterring war with China in the Pacific, recognizing [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=66.92s)]
*  the reality of scarcity and making the resourcing tradeoffs to ensure deterrence does not fail. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=73.72s)]
*  Deterrence cannot fail for all of our sakes. As the United States prioritizes its attention [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=81.44s)]
*  to these threats, European allies must lead from the front. And this just in, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=89.96s)]
*  President Trump says he held a phone call with President Vladimir Putin this morning. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=97.36s)]
*  Trump shared a lengthy truth social post saying, quote, we have also agreed to have our respective [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=101.52s)]
*  teams start negotiations immediately. And we will begin by calling President Zelensky of Ukraine [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=107.76s)]
*  to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now. CBS News Senior [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  National Security correspondent Charlie Daggadat joins us now for more on this. And Charlie, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  let's talk about the significance of this call. What are your thoughts here? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=124.16s)]
*  Hey, Mugo, you know, they're talking. That's the big significant development in this call. You know, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=128.68s)]
*  I saw the readout of on truth social. You called it a lengthy and highly productive phone call [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=136.4s)]
*  between both the men. He said that the war in Ukraine, Russia's war with Ukraine has to end [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  a war that has cost, in his words, millions of lives. That might be an exaggeration. But either [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=151.28s)]
*  way, both men had agreed that this needed to be ended and that, again, he will be speaking directly [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=157.84s)]
*  to President Zelensky. I can tell you that I can assume that President Zelensky's administration [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=164.0s)]
*  will be happy with some of the language used, not just from President Trump, but from [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=169.52s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as well, because there are certain sort of levers in negotiation [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=175.12s)]
*  that are being surrendered going forward, talking about regaining 2014 borders, joining NATO, etc. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=182.96s)]
*  So it's certainly an important development, this communication between this administration and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=191.36s)]
*  President Putin, Russia. And now it remains to be seen what's going to happen going forward, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=198.88000000000002s)]
*  not just in terms of negotiation, but in terms of America's involvement in Ukraine and NATO. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=205.44000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And you mentioned comments from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. I wanted to get your [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=211.12s)]
*  take on what he had to say. Yeah. Well, you know, unambiguous, I think, is the way I would describe [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=215.36s)]
*  it. I mean, he was very clear. You heard in that clip, he repeated that US troops would not be [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=222.88000000000002s)]
*  involved in any sort of post-war scenario. This has got to be European troops. He pointed out that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=228.88000000000002s)]
*  this is a non-NATO mission, and that's important. So in addition to saying, discussing that we [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=234.72000000000003s)]
*  wouldn't go back to the 2014 borders, he called it an unrealistic objective. Then he went even [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=241.84s)]
*  further, saying chasing it was an illusionary goal that would just prolong the war. Now, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=246.96s)]
*  President Zelensky himself, he sort of has rode back from wanting to hold on to Crimea. That would [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=253.36s)]
*  have been re-2014. That was under Ukraine territory, now under Russian territory. The Russians had up [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=260.48s)]
*  to 2014 had taken over the Donbass region. Remember, this conflict has been going on long [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=268.24s)]
*  before 2022, when we started covering it. And the important thing about when he talks about [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=273.44s)]
*  European forces being there in any sort of post-war scenario is that if you engage NATO troops, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=283.76000000000005s)]
*  that means that the United States has a level of responsibility in defending those NATO troops, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=291.20000000000005s)]
*  let alone American forces. It would trigger Article 5, et cetera. And that is why he's [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=295.76s)]
*  sort of laying the groundwork that American forces, he repeated it twice, American forces [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=300.88s)]
*  would not be involved directly inside Ukraine and wouldn't be part of any kind of post-war [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=306.32s)]
*  scenario going forward. Charlie, I want to talk about big picture here. The US follows through [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=312.64s)]
*  on its promise to put more pressure on Europe to lead this cause. Are we seeing a shift in [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=319.44s)]
*  US military priorities? Well, you know, Mugo, in a way it was to be expected. I don't think there [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=325.84s)]
*  are too many NATO partners that wouldn't have expected this sort of language. You know, the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=331.28s)]
*  Trump administration and the Biden administration, frankly, have been demanding that NATO European [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=334.79999999999995s)]
*  partners do more in their fair share. For instance, it was repeated again by the defense secretary. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=339.68s)]
*  They need to look closer at sort of 5% of their gross GDP to spend on defenses. This is very much, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=345.35999999999996s)]
*  just look at the map. This is a European issue. You know, countries like Germany and Poland, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=352.72s)]
*  Poland are already reaching that 5% and then some and hosting, you know, US forces there. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=357.12s)]
*  But this is very much a message that had been coming out of the Trump campaign even before [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=363.6s)]
*  becoming president and having this administration that Ukraine should be considered a European [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=369.92s)]
*  issue. Yes, the United States has been supporting Ukraine with billions of dollars of aid and will [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  continue to do so. That has been made clear. But this in terms of management is pushing forward to [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=381.6s)]
*  a European issue. I think it's also interesting that in defense secretary Hegset's initial [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=389.76000000000005s)]
*  address, yes, he mentioned Ukraine several times and mentioned American support or maybe a lack of [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=396.64000000000004s)]
*  American support in terms of boots on the ground, but never once did he mention President Putin in [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=402.56s)]
*  a conflict that President Putin might be argued began. That is very true. Charlie Dagda, thank [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=407.76s)]
*  you so much for giving us some insight and context to all of this. Appreciate your time today. Thank you. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nqFdXsiLzU&t=413.92s)]
