**CBS News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I)

*  And does a fantastic job in his country is his son [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=23.88s)]

*  we've had some quick discussions just now and we're gonna have some longer discussions after this and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=34.52s)]
*  The relationship with [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=40.64s)]
*  Jordan has been very strong has been with me and I really has been with the country [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=42.56s)]
*  But I think I've been closer than other presidents to Jordan and what Jordan [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  Represents and it's an honor to have you and your son with us today [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=52.32s)]
*  And if you'd like to say a few words and thank you very much [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  Thank you very much for having us and so short after your recognition [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=60.2s)]
*  I think just as a testament to what you said is a special relationship between our two countries and the personal relationship [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=63.84s)]
*  of the friendship and trust between the two of us [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=70.64s)]
*  Mr. President, I truly believe that with all the challenges that we have in the Middle East that I finally see [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=74.12s)]
*  Somebody that could take us across the finish line to bring [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=79.94000000000001s)]
*  Stability peace and prosperity to all of us in the region and it is I think our collective responsibility in the Middle Eastern [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=82.98s)]
*  Continue to work with you to support you to achieve those lofty goals [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=90.58000000000001s)]
*  So I'm very delighted to be here and as you said sir, we've got some very interesting discussions [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=94.26s)]
*  Thank you very much [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=99.46000000000001s)]
*  Many people in the region especially Jordan are worried about the annexation of the West Bank [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=101.82s)]
*  Will you give the his majesty the king guarantee that you won't allow Israel to annex the West Bank? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=106.69999999999999s)]
*  And how are you gonna think it's gonna work out very well. That's not really what we're talking about today [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=112.22s)]
*  I think that's something that's gonna work out automatically and it's in good shape and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=116.82s)]
*  We discuss it other people have discussed it with us and with me [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=123.06s)]
*  That's gonna work out West Bank is gonna work out very well [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=127.44s)]
*  Taking the Palestinian people he's made clear he doesn't want to well [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=131.46s)]
*  I don't know but he may have just something to say because we discussed just briefly [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=134.82000000000002s)]
*  I think maybe you want to say it now or well, Mr. President [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=139.62s)]
*  I think we have to keep in mind that there is a plan from Egypt and the Arab countries [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=144.34s)]
*  We're being invited by Mohammed bin Salman to discussions in Riyadh [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=150.5s)]
*  I think the point is is how do we make this work in a way that is good for everybody? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=153.98000000000002s)]
*  Obviously we have to look at the best interests of the United States of the people in the region [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=158.9s)]
*  Especially to my people of Jordan and we're going to have some interesting discussions today [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=164.02s)]
*  I think one of the things that we can do right away [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=168.38s)]
*  Is take two thousand children that are either cancer children or in very ill state [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=171.54s)]
*  To Jordan as quickly as possible and then wait for I think the Egyptians to present their plan on how we can work with [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=178.38s)]
*  The president to work on the college of challenges [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=185.26s)]
*  I didn't know that what you just said two thousand children with cancer or other problems and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=193.89999999999998s)]
*  That's really a beautiful gesture. That's really good and we appreciate it and we'll be working on the rest with [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=200.45999999999998s)]
*  With Egypt, I think you're gonna see some great progress. I think with Jordan you're gonna see some great progress [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=208.85999999999999s)]
*  Three of us and we'll have some others helping and we're gonna have some others that are very high level [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=215.26s)]
*  Helping and the whole thing will come it's not a complex thing to do and with the United States being in control of that [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=219.85999999999999s)]
*  Piece of land a fairly large piece of land. You can have stability in the Middle East for the first time and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=226.66s)]
*  The Palestinians or the people that live now in Gaza will be living beautifully in another location [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=233.57999999999998s)]
*  They're gonna be living safely. They're not going to be [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=239.38s)]
*  Killed murdered and having to leave every ten years because I've been watching this for so many years. It's nothing but trouble [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=242.62s)]
*  Everyone's being killed and being [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=250.58s)]
*  robbed it's it's it's like living in hell and they're gonna end up having a [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=252.9s)]
*  great home great [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=258.34000000000003s)]
*  families that don't have to get mugged and killed and beaten up and harassed by Hamas and everybody else and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=260.26s)]
*  I know we'll be able to work something and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=268.18s)]
*  You and you what you just said about the 2000 is fantastic. It's so beautiful. It's music to my ears [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=271.21999999999997s)]
*  But we're gonna be able to work something and I know we'll be able to work something also with [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=277.9s)]
*  with I believe [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=283.26s)]
*  Not not a hundred percent, but 99 percent. We're gonna work out something with Egypt [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=285.21999999999997s)]
*  How is my way is going to own Gaza your White House has been clear [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=294.26s)]
*  Taxpayer dollars won't be used for this. So what money you're going to use to buy? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=298.18s)]
*  We're not going to buy anything. We're gonna have it we're gonna keep it and we're gonna make sure that there's going to be peace and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=302.38s)]
*  there's not going to be any problem and nobody's going to question it and we're going to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=308.26s)]
*  Run it very properly and eventually we'll have [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=313.7s)]
*  economic development at a very large scale maybe the largest scale on that site and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=316.9s)]
*  We'll have lots of good things built there including hotels and office buildings and housing and other things [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=321.5s)]
*  And we'll make that site into what it should be and the people from Gaza who wouldn't be able to be there for years [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=327.86s)]
*  because you're talking about just to get it and prepare it and [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=334.18s)]
*  To take care of all of the problems that currently it has as you know tunnels and people are in those tunnels [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=338.26s)]
*  And you have some good people and some bad people and you may have [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=344.34000000000003s)]
*  Hostages right now, you know, you have the hostages [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=349.3s)]
*  Possibly there they don't know where they are and you know [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=352.18s)]
*  I have a Saturday deadline and I don't think they're gonna make the deadline personally. I think they [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=354.96000000000004s)]
*  They want to play tough guy, but we'll see how tough they are [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=360.82000000000005s)]
*  But it's it's gonna be a wonderful thing. It's gonna be wonderful for the Middle East. I think it'll turn the Middle East [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=364.98s)]
*  I think you're gonna have peace in the Middle East you can eventually have peace in the Middle East [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=369.98s)]
*  I [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=373.9s)]
*  Couldn't this deadline risk undermining the talks that you're having with the King today [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=376.14s)]
*  Risk the kind of wider piece that you're trying to because that's not we're not talking about a big situation [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=381.94s)]
*  We're talking about something that can go very quickly [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=387.34s)]
*  We're talking about it's gonna go quickly. It's not gonna take a long time. Okay, that's not good [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=390.61999999999995s)]
*  Where when you know bullies, you know the bully is right, you know the the bully [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=395.17999999999995s)]
*  I've always and I found it throughout my life a bully is the weakest person and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=400.05999999999995s)]
*  They're bullies Hamas is bullies [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=404.78s)]
*  The weakest people are bullies, you know that right? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=407.85999999999996s)]
*  All right, go ahead president. You were saying that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=411.02s)]
*  Palestinians will live somewhere else safe [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=413.78s)]
*  Where exactly do you want them to live? Well, it's not where I want them to live [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=416.26s)]
*  It's gonna be where we ultimately choose as a group and I believe we'll have a parcel of land in [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=420.85999999999996s)]
*  Jordan I believe we'll have a parcel of land in Egypt. We may have [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=427.94s)]
*  someplace else but I think when we finish our talks will have a place where [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=432.94s)]
*  they're gonna live very happily and very safely and you know, don't forget they [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=437.78s)]
*  Only want to be on the Gaza Strip because they don't know anything else [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=442.46s)]
*  They never had an alternative and they don't want to be in the Gaza Strip, but they have no choice [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=446.46s)]
*  They have to be and they're being killed there at levels that nobody's ever seen [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=451.34s)]
*  No place in the world is like as as dangerous as the Gaza Strip. They don't want to be there [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=455.62s)]
*  They have no alternative when they have no alternative not one person will want to stay where they are [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=461.1s)]
*  Nobody wants to stay there. They're living in hell. It's it's a death trap [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=466.42s)]
*  Mr. President, how do you know that the Palestinians don't want to leave the land? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=471.54s)]
*  Some people say this is ethnic cleansing you won't be able to force them to leave the land [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=475.54s)]
*  We're moving into a beautiful [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=480.28000000000003s)]
*  Location where they have new homes where they can live safely where they'll have doctors and medical and all of those things [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=483.04s)]
*  And I think it's gonna be great. Yeah any questions King of Dilla? What do you think about the US taking over the concert? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=490.88s)]
*  Do you want to see the US own the Gaza Strip? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=496.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, I think as I said earlier, the president is looking at Egypt coming to present their plan [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=499.0s)]
*  As I said, we will be in Saudi Arabia to discuss how we can work with the president and with the United States [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=505.16s)]
*  So I think let's wait until the Egyptians can come and present it to the president and not get ahead of ourselves [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=511.52s)]
*  Well, I think what we said I have to look at the best interests of my country [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=520.12s)]
*  I think the the president is very happy that we do this thing with 2,000 children as quickly as possible [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=524.22s)]
*  And again, I believe that the president is looking forward to getting a group of us Arabs here to discuss the overall plan [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=529.8s)]
*  Absolutely [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=541.44s)]
*  That's from the Gaza Strip the 2000 [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=543.6s)]
*  Are you willing to change your mind if you hear the Egyptian and the Arab plan? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=546.28s)]
*  If they present you something different, I think we sort of have gone down the line [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=551.24s)]
*  We know pretty much what is going to be presented and I think it's going to be something that's going to be magnificent for the Palestinians [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=557.16s)]
*  They're going to they're going to be in love with it. I did very well with real estate. I can tell you about real estate [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=565.04s)]
*  They're going to be in love with it [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=570.52s)]
*  First of all number of people relative to other things that have taken place over the decades and centuries [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=578.04s)]
*  it's a very small number of people and [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=584.0s)]
*  They're living a terrible life. Look at look at the way they're living now. Nobody's nobody's living like that in the entire world [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=586.64s)]
*  They're living under buildings that are mostly fallen down and will continue to fall down and [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=595.72s)]
*  They're living under people are being killed every day. The conditions are horrible [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=601.0s)]
*  There are no conditions anywhere in the world that are worse than the Gaza Strip right now [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=605.04s)]
*  But don't you [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=609.78s)]
*  You said all hell will break out if all the hostages are not released on Saturday [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=612.42s)]
*  What did you mean by that? And are you encouraging Netanyahu to walk away from this deal? Have you talked about this? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=616.4599999999999s)]
*  So I've looked at what? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=621.3s)]
*  At the condition of people coming out of the hostage situation and it's horrible [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=623.3s)]
*  I looked at the before and after yesterday [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=629.38s)]
*  Three young men one one is dead now as you know the older gentleman who died [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=633.78s)]
*  Everybody said he was alive and well, he's he's dead, but the three young men and I looked at them [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=639.9399999999999s)]
*  From a short while ago and I looked at him now. They are emaciated. They look like Holocaust survivors. They looked [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=646.22s)]
*  I mean they'll get better but they [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=654.62s)]
*  They're in rough shape. They were treated really badly and we've heard things from them since [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=658.02s)]
*  and I think the reason that [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=663.4599999999999s)]
*  Hamas is playing [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=666.4599999999999s)]
*  So cute is because they probably they saw the reaction to these three people that came out and the and the other was look [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=668.02s)]
*  the one young lady and her hand blown off practically and [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=675.42s)]
*  They were not in great shape either [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=679.3s)]
*  But she's missing her fingers and a big part of her hand. You know what she did [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=681.8199999999999s)]
*  She was stopping a bullet that was aimed at her [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=686.26s)]
*  She went like that that it blew off her hand [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=688.98s)]
*  And [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=692.0200000000001s)]
*  Now I think what they're I think they want time because I think they the people that they have living are in such bad shape [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=693.22s)]
*  Because they're sending the most healthy people out [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=700.58s)]
*  Because they don't want to send the least healthy people out and there was an uproar when they saw the people from yesterday [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=704.34s)]
*  So these people are [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=711.1s)]
*  So I don't want to do two and then we do another two and another week and then we do four and three weeks [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=713.0600000000001s)]
*  No, no, they either have them out [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=719.1800000000001s)]
*  by Saturday at 12 o'clock or [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=721.94s)]
*  All bets are off [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=724.74s)]
*  Mr. President, would you still consider withholding aid to those countries if they don't accept your plans to accept? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=727.4200000000001s)]
*  Well, I don't want to say that because we've had such a good relationship and we're doing so well just in the short time that [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=733.34s)]
*  We've been talking. I mean [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=739.2600000000001s)]
*  The King just made a statement. I didn't ask him to do that [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=741.6600000000001s)]
*  about [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=746.86s)]
*  Literally saving 2,000 young children from the Gaza Strip [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=748.3s)]
*  We didn't know about that you didn't know about that nobody did except for the king and his son [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=754.02s)]
*  I assume you told your son, right? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=758.74s)]
*  And I just thought it was great. No, I think we'll do something. I don't have to threaten with money [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=761.26s)]
*  We do we contribute a lot of money to Jordan and to Egypt by the way a lot to both [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=766.54s)]
*  But I don't have to threaten that I don't think I think we're above that. I do believe we're above this [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=772.88s)]
*  Would you consider other countries not Jordan and Egypt there was talks about Indonesia Albania other places? Yeah [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=778.78s)]
*  And we have other [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=786.06s)]
*  Countries that want to get involved. We have a lot of people who want to get involved. There's a great sense of [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=788.0999999999999s)]
*  Wanting to help the Palestinians [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=795.06s)]
*  they really there's a lot of good countries out there people that rule those countries with [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=797.14s)]
*  Big hearts and this gentleman is at the top of the list [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=802.3s)]
*  They don't want to leave how are you gonna force them? Oh, they're gonna be great. They're gonna they're gonna be very happy [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=805.4200000000001s)]
*  The [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=818.78s)]
*  Response will be from a multitude of countries Arab international [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=820.62s)]
*  I know the Europeans want to step in and again, we'll probably have to look to the help of the United States to make sure that [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=824.76s)]
*  Kogat which is the clearing agency on the Israeli side makes as efficient as possible [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=831.7199999999999s)]
*  Because 2,000 kids the best way to get to them is by helicopters and get them straight to our [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=836.3199999999999s)]
*  Institutions I also believe that quite a few countries would also probably like to take some of those kids [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=841.04s)]
*  It has a treated in there [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=845.92s)]
*  Yes, and that's right this should have been done by the Biden administration, but you know, they didn't do anything [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=849.5999999999999s)]
*  They didn't know what the hell they were doing. So this should have been done by the Biden administration [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=854.88s)]
*  This should have never happened because October 7th would have never happened if I were president zero chance of happening [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=858.76s)]
*  You wouldn't have had that a whole mess where the Middle East got blown up and you wouldn't have had Ukraine and Russia [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=865.0799999999999s)]
*  Fighting that would have never happened. And by the way, we're making good progress there. I think I really think we're making some very good progress [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=871.78s)]
*  Would buy Gaza and today you just said we're not going to buy Gaza [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=882.16s)]
*  Not gonna have to buy we're gonna we're gonna have Gaza we don't have to buy there's nothing to buy [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=885.92s)]
*  We will have Gaza. What is that? No reason to buy? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=892.28s)]
*  There is nothing to buy. It's Gaza. It's it's a war-torn area. We're gonna take it. We're gonna hold it [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=895.64s)]
*  We're gonna cherish it. We're going to [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=902.28s)]
*  Get it going eventually where a lot of jobs are going to be created for the people in the Middle East [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=905.64s)]
*  It's it's going to be for the people in the Middle East, but I think it could be a diamond [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=910.88s)]
*  It could be an absolute [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=914.28s)]
*  Tremendous asset for the Middle East and you're gonna have peace [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=916.76s)]
*  It's gonna bring peace in the Middle East Gaza the way it is right now every 10 years [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=919.9599999999999s)]
*  You're gonna have the same thing happening. I've watched it so long all the death and destruction of Gaza [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=924.68s)]
*  The civilization has been wiped out in Gaza. No, it's gonna be a tremendous thing. It's [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=930.4s)]
*  It's fronting on the sea [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=937.04s)]
*  It's gonna be a great economic development job [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=939.24s)]
*  Put people to work a lot of people to work and those people are all gonna be from the Middle East [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=941.8000000000001s)]
*  Can you clarify again sir, how do you feel about the US taking Gaza as the president said well again [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=951.2s)]
*  This is something that we as Arabs will be [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=958.12s)]
*  Coming to the United States with something that we're going to talk about later to discuss all these options [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=962.08s)]
*  Mr. President take it under what authority it is sovereign under the US authority [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=968.4799999999999s)]
*  Mr. President, would you seek to personally develop property in Gaza after this happens? No, I've had a great career in real estate [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=973.0s)]
*  You know when you've done what I've done in the last [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=981.56s)]
*  number of years including the four years that [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=984.88s)]
*  We should have been doing something else frankly because people see that now for sure [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=988.16s)]
*  but [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=992.52s)]
*  When you've done what I've done [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=993.76s)]
*  You can just do more good for people [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=996.4399999999999s)]
*  When you're president when you're president we can do things [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=999.24s)]
*  This is all things that should have been done [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1001.96s)]
*  But actually things that shouldn't have had to be done a Gaza [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1004.56s)]
*  Absolutely, it would have been it would have been so great if the Biden administration would have started this but actually in all fairness to them [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1008.6s)]
*  it was [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1017.12s)]
*  They should have never let it happen [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1019.04s)]
*  It did happen and because of the fact that they let this happen this catastrophe of October 7th [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1021.0s)]
*  Something like this becomes practical and very real meaning the development and and all of the things that I've talked about with respect [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1027.28s)]
*  to the Gaza Strip [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1034.56s)]
*  If you didn't have the October 7th catastrophe and it was a horrible catastrophe [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1036.76s)]
*  Then probably you wouldn't be talking about that [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1042.32s)]
*  But the the only thing I can say is this is going to bring stability and peace to the Middle East and [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1044.72s)]
*  Ultimately when it's developed which will be in quite a while from now [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1052.3200000000002s)]

*  We're going to have it. We're going to take it then the question was asked of the president by what authority and he said under [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1135.46s)]
*  US authority this is something we have not heard from a sitting US president [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1143.0600000000002s)]
*  I can think of in recent history or ever [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1148.02s)]
*  Read it's definitely unprecedented this entire plan to overtake Gaza and [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1153.6200000000001s)]
*  His [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1160.26s)]
*  Reasoning for why he thinks he can do it which is not true [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1161.42s)]
*  Gaza is a sovereign territory the US cannot just go around the world and take control of [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1165.6200000000001s)]
*  areas that it wishes to [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1172.02s)]
*  And so the president did not explain [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1174.54s)]
*  Why he thinks he can do that? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1179.22s)]
*  He did not explain what he meant by US authority and you read hit the nail right on the head [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1181.58s)]
*  When you were talking about what the Jordanian king offered which was to take two thousand sick children [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1188.02s)]
*  Who have illnesses and cancer? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1195.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean there are two million people in Gaza and the president wants Jordan and Egypt to take all of them [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1197.26s)]
*  While he redeveloped this as a real estate plan [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1205.5s)]
*  2,000 kids versus two million people that's very different and the president seemed to [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1210.14s)]
*  Suggest that he thinks Jordan and Egypt and other Arab nations would eventually be on board with taking all two million [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1216.54s)]
*  But the king was very [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1223.02s)]
*  Careful and very strategic in his words and saying that we have to consult with our counterparts [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1225.02s)]
*  We have to have a broader meeting but keep in mind read [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1231.34s)]
*  You know Jordan along with those other countries have already issued a statement to say they support a two-state [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1235.82s)]
*  Palestinian solution they do not believe that the Palestinians should be displaced and they will not take [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1243.34s)]
*  Those Palestinians in the meantime and so this is a really awkward [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1250.78s)]
*  Conversation that we just saw play out here and it's notable read that yesterday the president said that he would consider withholding [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1256.3799999999999s)]
*  Us aid from Jordan and other countries who do not comply essentially with what he wants which is for them to take [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1264.8999999999999s)]
*  The displaced Palestinians today. He changed his tune because he was sitting right next to the king and he said well [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1272.3799999999999s)]
*  I don't think we'll get there. I don't think we have to we're already making good progress [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1278.74s)]
*  So, you know, this is a very careful conversation that they are having in public [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1281.98s)]
*  But I'm very curious to learn more about what they talk about in private read, right? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1288.5s)]
*  And it seemed that when you listen to the king right there that he wanted Egypt to have more to say here [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1294.3s)]
*  But you know you bring the dollars and cents conversation in [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1300.38s)]
*  President Donald Trump was heard there saying the US gives a lot of money to Egypt as well [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1303.66s)]
*  Is that we do what we're really talking about here? You know, the president says we're above that [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1308.46s)]
*  We don't have to make a threat [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1312.8600000000001s)]
*  But the threat is there in the air that dollars could be pulled from Jordan dollars could be pulled from Egypt [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1314.22s)]
*  Is that really what it's going to come down to when he says under US authority? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1320.6200000000001s)]
*  Is he really meaning under US threat of pulling dollars? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1324.8200000000002s)]
*  Well, I think you know if you just listen to what the president said yesterday read [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1329.8600000000001s)]
*  Yes, that is at the heart of it because even though these countries have repeatedly and publicly said they will not take [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1335.1399999999999s)]
*  these displaced Palestinians from Gaza [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1342.54s)]
*  President Trump has also said time and time again that he thinks they'll change their minds [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1345.58s)]
*  So you have to wonder what political levers he has well [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1350.1s)]
*  I can tell you that in 2022 the State Department agreed to a new deal with Jordan to supply [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1353.22s)]
*  $1.45 billion in aid a year and we did just hear the king say that he has to do what's best for his country [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1359.84s)]
*  without committing to anything beyond that [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1369.1599999999999s)]
*  2,000 children, but certainly this is an important calculation and it gives President Trump leverage [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1371.6s)]
*  Now even if he found a place for two million Palestinians to go [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1379.84s)]
*  There still remains so many questions read about his vision for rebuilding and I think the central question today is [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1385.22s)]
*  How are you going to end the war first before we even start talking about? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1393.5s)]
*  Rebuilding we know that the ceasefire deal is extremely fragile [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1398.78s)]
*  Especially since President Trump set a new deadline yesterday in saying that if all the hostages are not released by Saturday [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1403.7s)]
*  Then quote all hell will break loose read [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1411.26s)]
*  Well and also news broke while we were inside of this experience [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1415.34s)]
*  Watching outside of the White House to see what was going on behind closed doors between the King of Jordan and President Donald Trump [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1419.4199999999998s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu seemed to echo almost word for word what President Donald Trump said by way of that Saturday deadline [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1425.98s)]
*  We have to remind our viewers [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1433.3s)]
*  We are in phase one of what is likely or at least thought initially to be a two-phase [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1434.78s)]
*  Ceasefire and hostage release deal now Hamas has paused [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1440.38s)]
*  They paused in their release because they say Israel is going back on some of their promises [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1444.66s)]
*  But how can this be seen if we're threatening a deadline on Saturday that all hell will break loose [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1450.06s)]
*  How can this not be seen as Israel and United United States also ripping up their side of the deal today not Saturday, but today [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1455.34s)]
*  Yeah [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1463.38s)]
*  Well, and this was the Biden [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1464.54s)]
*  Administration's worst nightmare as it related to the ceasefire deal that they spent so many months of brokering [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1466.54s)]
*  read and you're right that there were two phases when it came to releasing all the hostages and [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1473.9s)]
*  Ending the war permanently the third phase was supposed to be [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1479.78s)]
*  Rebuilding Gaza and there were a lot of concerns about whether the Trump administration would be able to successfully [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1484.22s)]
*  Implement the ceasefire deal now. You may remember when all parties signed it [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1492.54s)]
*  There was praise from President Trump. He said it was an epic deal [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1498.8600000000001s)]
*  He said it never would have crossed over the finish line if not for his victory in November if not for his [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1502.5s)]
*  Middle East envoy seat with Wicoff who did play an instrumental role in [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1510.42s)]
*  Sealing the deal and there was high praise for the agreement [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1516.1s)]
*  Well, I think it was really telling read that when Prime Minister Netanyahu visited the White House about a week ago at that time [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1519.86s)]
*  Steve Wicoff said [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1527.34s)]
*  You know, he was asked what if Israel just says we're not going to end the war [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1529.1399999999999s)]
*  What about that and what was a really revealing bit of information was Wicoff said? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1533.6999999999998s)]
*  Well, look the problem is we signed a deal. They signed a deal that was not so wonderful [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1539.4599999999998s)]
*  You know the Trump administration had nothing to do with that deal [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1544.1399999999999s)]
*  We did not dictate the terms and so they were already backing off [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1547.3799999999999s)]
*  From this praise of the ceasefire agreement [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1551.78s)]
*  I think opening a door realizing that it might fall apart and here we are today read to your point [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1555.76s)]
*  It seems as though they are ready to start over renegotiate and the deal whatever you want to call it [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1562.5s)]
*  remains to be seen unless [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1569.5s)]
*  The hostages are all released which as you mentioned Hamas has already said is not going to happen [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1572.26s)]
*  And so this like I mentioned is exactly why the Biden administration was so fearful [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1576.82s)]
*  That even though they were able to get it done. It wasn't going to be up to them to carry it out and [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1583.1s)]
*  Now we are seeing a very different turn of events read and we don't know what the future will be for Gaza [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1591.66s)]
*  We do Jane so much to keep track of and literally history writing itself in real time [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1598.7s)]
*  Thank you so much for that live report from the White House invaluable [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnC-p5_z6I&t=1605.06s)]
