# Canada's Trudeau calls Trump tariffs "a very dumb thing to do"
**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg)
*  Alright, so earlier in the show we told you about the tariffs that Trump has now imposed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=0.0s)]
*  on Canada, Mexico, and China. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=4.38s)]
*  Now moments ago we heard from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=6.88s)]
*  Let's listen to that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=10.08s)]
*  So today the United States launched a trade war against Canada. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=14.44s)]
*  Their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=19.98s)]
*  At the same time, they're talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=24.38s)]
*  Vladimir Putin, a lying, murderous dictator. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=30.46s)]
*  Make that make sense. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=35.54s)]
*  Canadians are reasonable and we are polite, but we will not back down from a fight. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=39.42s)]
*  Not when our country and the well-being of everyone in it is at stake. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=45.86s)]
*  At the moment, the US tariffs came into effect in the early hours of this morning, and so [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=53.26s)]
*  did the Canadian response. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=60.46s)]
*  Canada will be implementing 25% tariffs against $155 billion worth of American goods, starting [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=63.94s)]
*  with tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods immediately, and tariffs on the remaining [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=73.1s)]
*  $125 billion of American products in 21 days' time. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=78.82s)]
*  Again, today, we are forced to impose 25% tariffs on $155 billion worth of American goods, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=84.82s)]
*  $30 billion worth of American goods immediately, and in 21 days, $125 billion worth of goods. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=96.66s)]
*  Today, we will also be challenging these illegal actions by filing dispute resolution claims [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=109.69999999999999s)]
*  at the World Trade Organization and through the USMCA. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=117.3s)]
*  But in the meantime, our tariffs will remain in place until the US tariffs are withdrawn [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=122.25999999999999s)]
*  and not a moment sooner. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=129.01999999999998s)]
*  And should these tariffs not cease, we are in active and ongoing discussions with provinces [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=132.42s)]
*  and territories to pursue several non-tariff measures, measures which will demonstrate [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=137.94s)]
*  that there are no winners in a trade war. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=145.38s)]
*  Now, just like I did a month ago, I want to speak first directly to the American people. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=151.06s)]
*  We don't want this. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=160.02s)]
*  We want to work with you as a friend and ally. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=162.1s)]
*  And we don't want to see you hurt either. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=166.7s)]
*  But your government has chosen to do this to you. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=170.26s)]
*  As of this morning, markets are down and inflation is set to rise dramatically all across your country. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=177.42s)]
*  Your government has chosen to put American jobs at risk at the thousands of workplaces [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=185.1s)]
*  that succeed because of materials from Canada or because of consumers in Canada or both. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=192.38000000000002s)]
*  They've chosen to raise costs for American consumers on everyday essential items like [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=201.58s)]
*  groceries and gas, on major purchases like cars and homes, and everything in between. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=207.14000000000001s)]
*  They've chosen to harm American national security, impeding access to the abundant [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=215.3s)]
*  critical minerals, energy, building materials, and fertilizers that we have and that the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=221.18s)]
*  United States needs to grow and prosper. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=228.26s)]
*  They've chosen to launch a trade war that will, first and foremost, harm American families. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=234.5s)]
*  They've chosen to sabotage their own agenda that was supposed to usher in a new golden [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=241.9s)]
*  age for the United States. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=248.5s)]
*  And they've chosen to undermine the incredible work we've done together to tackle the scourge [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=252.74s)]
*  that is fentanyl, a drug that must be wiped from the face of the earth. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=259.02s)]
*  So on that point, let me be crystal clear. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=265.22s)]
*  There is absolutely no justification or need whatsoever for these tariffs today. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=269.3s)]
*  Now the legal pretext your government is using to bring in these tariffs is that Canada is [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=279.66s)]
*  apparently unwilling to help in the fight against illegal fentanyl. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=286.3s)]
*  Well, that is totally false. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=291.18s)]
*  Let's look at the facts. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=296.02s)]
*  Our border is already safe and secure. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=298.18s)]
*  Far less than 1% of fentanyl flows and less than 1% of illegal crossings into the United [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=302.5s)]
*  States comes from Canada. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=308.3s)]
*  But we acted because we know we can always do better. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=310.86s)]
*  We responded to concerns, including from the President, by implementing an ambitious $1.3 [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=317.1s)]
*  million border plan. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=323.98s)]
*  A border plan that includes generational investments in new AI and imaging tools to stop the flow [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=325.46000000000004s)]
*  of fentanyl in its tracks, stronger coordination and information sharing with American agencies, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=332.66s)]
*  along with the deployment of drones, helicopters and additional personnel to keep our border [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=340.14000000000004s)]
*  secure. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=345.86s)]
*  Now a month ago, as part of an agreement with the United States that paused the tariffs, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=347.82s)]
*  we made further commitments. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=353.3s)]
*  We appointed Kevin Brosseau as our fentanyl czar, a man who dedicated his multi-decade [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=355.98s)]
*  career in law enforcement to combating organized crime networks and drug trafficking. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=362.58000000000004s)]
*  We designated seven drug cartels, sick, evil groups who cynically profit off the pain and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=369.1s)]
*  suffering of people on both sides of the border, as the terrorist organizations that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=375.84s)]
*  they are. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=380.96s)]
*  And just yesterday, we launched a new Joint Operations Partnership, supported by a $200 [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=383.32s)]
*  million investment between Canada's security and law enforcement agencies, a partnership [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=390.32s)]
*  that will enhance the coordination of information and intelligence in order to thwart criminal [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=397.12s)]
*  gangs involved in the illegal fentanyl trade. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=402.32s)]
*  And critically, our actions are working. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=407.0s)]
*  As the U.S. States, as the U.S. Customs and Border Protection just acknowledged, there [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  was a 97% drop in fentanyl seizures from January compared to December, to a near zero low of [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=418.12s)]
*  less than half an ounce seized in January, even with all the further enforcements and [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=429.48s)]
*  actions we've taken at the borders. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=438.76s)]
*  In sum, we stepped up. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=441.56s)]
*  We engaged closely and constructively with the President and his administration. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=445.38s)]
*  We did everything we promised. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=450.68s)]
*  We stuck to our word. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=453.46s)]
*  And we did it because we believe in working together to protect our citizens. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=456.52s)]
*  Now, I want to speak directly to one specific American, Donald. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=463.52s)]
*  In the over eight years you and I have worked together, we've done big things. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=472.52s)]
*  We signed a historic deal that has created record jobs and growth in both of our countries. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=480.8s)]
*  We've done big things together on the world stage, as Canada and the U.S. have done together [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=487.56s)]
*  for decades, for generations. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=494.32s)]
*  And now, we should be working together to ensure even greater prosperity for North Americans [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=498.08000000000004s)]
*  in a very uncertain and challenging world. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=506.08s)]
*  Now, it's not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal, but Donald, they [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=510.08s)]
*  point out that even though you're a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=518.4s)]
*  We, two friends fighting, is exactly what our opponents around the world want to see. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=526.4s)]
*  And now, to my fellow Canadians, I won't sugarcoat it. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=538.4s)]
*  This is going to be tough, even though we're all going to pull together, because that's [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=543.9s)]
*  what we do. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=549.9s)]
*  We will use every tool at our disposal so Canadian workers and businesses can weather [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=551.4s)]
*  this storm. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=556.8199999999999s)]
*  From expanding EI benefits and making them more flexible, to providing direct supports [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=558.4s)]
*  to businesses, we will be there as needed to help. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=563.56s)]
*  But Canada, make no mistake, no matter how long this lasts, no matter what the cost, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=568.4s)]
*  the federal government and other orders of government will be there for you. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=575.64s)]
*  We will defend Canadian jobs. We will take measures to prevent predatory [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=580.8s)]
*  behaviour that threatens Canadian companies because of the impacts of this trade war, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=586.56s)]
*  leaving them open to takeovers. We will relentlessly fight to protect our economy. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=592.1999999999999s)]
*  We will stand up for Canadians every single second of every single day, because this country [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=600.4399999999999s)]
*  is worth fighting for. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=608.0s)]
*  Okay, you were just hearing from Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responding to [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=611.0s)]
*  the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. He said they are part of his speech basically [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=621.44s)]
*  just saying that this is dumb, a dumb thing to do. That was his direct message to President [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=626.6s)]
*  Donald Trump, but he also told Canadians that things are going to be tough for a bit. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=633.08s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News Money Watch correspondent Kelly O'Grady. And Kelly, I want to ask you [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=637.5600000000001s)]
*  this, what is your response to what you just heard from Canadian Prime Minister Justin [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=642.9200000000001s)]
*  Trudeau? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=647.1600000000001s)]
*  So I look at this in terms of two ways we go. I mean free trade, Canada, Mexico, these [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=650.2800000000001s)]
*  are two of our biggest trading partners and we have built so many of our various supply [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=656.2s)]
*  chains, whether it is the automotive industry or the energy industry to have free trade [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=662.4399999999999s)]
*  going across those borders. So from one perspective, this is tough and both sides are going to [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=668.92s)]
*  feel the pain because they're so interconnected and reliant on each other. And I think it [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=676.1999999999999s)]
*  also does send a message when there are trade agreements in place, like the USMCA, that [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=682.3199999999999s)]
*  is the US-Mexico-Canada agreement that was done during President Trump's first term, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=688.32s)]
*  that well, things can, you can go back on your word. And so there is one half of me [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=693.9200000000001s)]
*  that looks at it this way. The other half of me looks at it as look, Trudeau is correct, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=699.1600000000001s)]
*  Canadians are going to feel pain. We will feel pain here in this country, but Canadians [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHo8T4j5kqg&t=706.0400000000001s)]
