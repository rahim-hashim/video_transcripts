# Duckworth, a former Black Hawk pilot, on D.C. plane crash
**CBS News:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI)
*  Now, lawmakers of both sides of the aisle are expressing their condolences. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=0.0s)]
*  And they're also asking how this could have happened. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  So let's head on over to Capitol Hill with CBS News congressional correspondent Nicole [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Killian. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=8.84s)]
*  Nicole, you had a rather enlightening interview with Senator Tammy Duckworth about the crash. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=9.84s)]
*  What did she say? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=14.88s)]
*  Well, she is still gathering information just like everyone else is. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  She was briefed by federal officials not too long ago. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  And so she is hoping to glean more information. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=26.86s)]
*  So she is kind of refraining from commenting on what might have happened. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=30.82s)]
*  However, she did tell us from her own personal experience, of course, she was a combat pilot [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=35.78s)]
*  for many years. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=43.1s)]
*  In fact, she was involved in an accident when her own Black Hawk helicopter went down along [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=44.1s)]
*  with her crew. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=48.739999999999995s)]
*  That is ultimately how she lost her legs and her limbs. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=50.019999999999996s)]
*  But obviously, she is still here today as a survivor from that accident. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=54.94s)]
*  And so I talk more personally to her about that experience, but also what comes to mind [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=59.58s)]
*  when she sees an accident like what we all witnessed last night. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=65.7s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=69.7s)]
*  You know very intimately what it's like to be in a Black Hawk. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=71.22s)]
*  You also know what it's like to be in a Black Hawk when it goes down. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=75.6s)]
*  What goes through your mind in a moment like that? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=80.66s)]
*  Well, you know, our soldiers are the best trained in the world and they would have been doing [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=85.02s)]
*  their jobs and everything that they could until their very last moment to do their jobs [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=88.74s)]
*  and stick with the training that they've received. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=93.17999999999999s)]
*  I have every confidence in that helicopter crew that they are well trained. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=96.41999999999999s)]
*  They wouldn't be out there in this special airspace. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=100.17999999999999s)]
*  The airspace around Washington, D.C., especially this inner ring is called the SFRA, the Special [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=103.02s)]
*  Flight Restricted Area. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=107.5s)]
*  You don't get to fly in that without additional flight training. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=108.53999999999999s)]
*  So we know that this is a trained crew that was in there. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=111.78s)]
*  We just have to hold, you know, just be patient. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=114.86s)]
*  Let the accident investigators do their job and we'll figure out what happened. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=117.14s)]
*  Now from the briefing that she had with officials earlier today, she said she was made aware [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=121.22s)]
*  that there was some communication between air traffic controllers and the Black Hawk [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=126.36s)]
*  helicopter and that it appeared that they did receive that communication from air traffic [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  control. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=138.3s)]
*  And kind of what happened beyond that, she still certainly has questions and has asked [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=139.3s)]
*  for a transcript of some of that air traffic control traffic. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=144.02s)]
*  She has also said that she doesn't believe that this crew had any type of night vision [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=150.38000000000002s)]
*  goggles or were using night vision goggles at the time of this. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=155.82000000000002s)]
*  But she also said it's not necessarily required and also just talked about being in a populated [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=159.46s)]
*  area like D.C. because there are a lot of lights. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=164.62s)]
*  Something that you may or may not need. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=167.26s)]
*  But she believes that certainly the crew executed in the best way possible based on the training [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=169.98s)]
*  and experience that they had. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=176.5s)]
*  But obviously, like all of us, is still waiting to get more answers as this investigation [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=178.22s)]
*  continues. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=183.54s)]
*  Nicole, I have less than a minute with you. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=184.54s)]
*  But confirmation hearings for President Trump's nominees were today. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=186.22s)]
*  Did this come up? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=189.1s)]
*  It did. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=191.42s)]
*  You know, she was part of a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee where [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=192.42s)]
*  they were holding a confirmation hearing for the nominee for secretary of the Army, Daniel [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=196.01999999999998s)]
*  Driscoll. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=202.54s)]
*  So it did come up and that the committee did take a moment of silence during that hearing [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=203.54s)]
*  to pause to remember the victims. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=208.26s)]
*  But there were some questions asked about safety and training protocol going forward. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=211.32s)]
*  We have heard from other members of Congress on this issue as well. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=216.42s)]
*  Certainly everybody, their thoughts and prayers are with the families, but certainly a lot [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=220.7s)]
*  of concerns about aviation safety and what role Congress may play going forward. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=223.98s)]
*  Nicole Killian, thank you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDf3EhEgmI&t=228.57999999999998s)]
