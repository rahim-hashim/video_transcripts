# Israel and Hamas agree to ceasefire, hostage deal after 15 months of war | Special Report
**CBS News:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY)
*  This is a CBS News special report. I'm Errol Barnett. We have breaking news for you coming out of the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel and Hamas have agreed to a ceasefire and hostage deal after 15 months of war. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=7.28s)]
*  This deal comes after many months of negotiations brokered through the U.S., Egypt, and Qatar. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=13.68s)]
*  This chapter of the conflict began, you may remember, when Hamas orchestrated a terror attack on Israeli soil back in October of 2023. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  That killed 1200 and they took another 250 people hostage. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=28.4s)]
*  Nearly 100 hostages are still inside Gaza and at least a third are believed to be dead. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=33.12s)]
*  Now the Hamas-led attack also led to an Israeli military invasion into Gaza that killed more than 46,000 Palestinians. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=38.4s)]
*  We want to bring in Face the Nation moderator and our Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent, Margaret Brennan, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  who has been working the phones to get the latest information on this. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=52.88s)]
*  Margaret, tell us what is part of this agreement? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=56.24s)]
*  This is a breakthrough deal as you just described it. It's also going to be incredibly difficult to implement, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=59.92s)]
*  but what it could mean is that as soon as this weekend, as soon as Sunday, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  you could see hostages released from Gaza handed over by Hamas back to Israel. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=71.44s)]
*  We will be watching to see the implementation of this. What we know is that on paper, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=79.6s)]
*  Hamas and Israel have agreed to a deal that has multiple stages. The first phase, perhaps the most important, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=84.72s)]
*  particularly to some of those American families who have been waiting to see their loved ones return. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=91.44s)]
*  This is a 42-day implementation during which 33 of those hostages, some alive, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=96.72s)]
*  some status unconfirmed, would be released in small numbers during which time we would also see [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  some redeployment of troops. We would also see aid go into Gaza, aid that is very much needed [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=111.2s)]
*  as famine-like conditions exist inside. Israel controls the entire security perimeter [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=118.48s)]
*  of that Palestinian territory, which is so embattled. What we know is that this announcement [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=123.68s)]
*  is expected to come in Doha, Qatar. That's because it is Qatar, a U.S. partner and the United States [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=130.72s)]
*  that have forced this deal to come together. The U.S. pressing the Netanyahu government, Qatar and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=138.08s)]
*  Egypt pressing Hamas to get to this deal today. It has been negotiated with the agreement of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=144.24s)]
*  the brother of Yahya Sinwar, the architect of that brutal assault on Israel that you described. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=152.08s)]
*  His brother signed off on this deal, I am told, by high-level U.S. and local sources who say this [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  means it's official. Even just within the past hour, Errol, this thing could have fallen apart, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=164.48s)]
*  but there are planning, as you saw there, I think, pictures there of a press conference [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=169.92s)]
*  being put together where the details will be released. But the bottom line here is of the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  hostages that were taken, seven of them still in captivity are U.S. citizens. Three of them [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=181.12s)]
*  assessed to be alive. We will have to see if this deal is fully implemented, meaning this is little [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=190.88000000000002s)]
*  by little, a few hostages, movement on each side. If all the steps go through and this is fully [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  implemented, they could see the return, for example, of 64-year-old Keith Siegel, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  Eden Alexander, a U.S. citizen, Segi Chen. We'll be watching for that as well as the remains of some [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=210.0s)]
*  of the hostages that remain in Hamas captivity. Errol, this is really striking because it comes [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=216.48s)]
*  in the final days of the Biden administration. It was President Biden who sent his diplomatic team [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=222.16s)]
*  saying, get this done. In fact, U.S. negotiator Brett McGurk has been there for the better part [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=227.67999999999998s)]
*  of a month trying to get negotiations closed. And what's so fascinating here is he had assistance [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=233.04s)]
*  from Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. And I am told by sources in the region [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=240.16s)]
*  and U.S. officials that they were working really as a team representing the United States, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=246.88s)]
*  pressing Israel to agree to concessions, pressing Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to agree to these [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=252.72s)]
*  concessions. In the next few days, this will be critical. Back in Israel, because it is a democracy [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=259.2s)]
*  and they have a process for that, the deal will still have to be agreed to by the cabinet. It will [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=267.52s)]
*  still have to go before the Knesset. And one thing to watch here that could really lead to political [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  blowback, and I know our Rami and Asensio is in the region watching this, is the names of the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners who will be released. There are a number of Palestinians who are part of this [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=283.52s)]
*  deal who have been in Israeli detention facilities for some time. As their list of names is made [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  public, we could see court cases challenging the release here. So there is a process here that could [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=295.36s)]
*  make this very difficult in just the next 48 hours. But the U.S. at this point believes they have gotten [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=302.8s)]
*  Israel and Hamas over the finish line here with the assistance of Qatar and Egypt. And for Joe [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  Biden in the final days of his administration, this is the deal that he was really wanting to see, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=316.32s)]
*  to bring to end such an incredibly bloody war that has killed over 47,000 Palestinians in Gaza, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=323.12s)]
*  that has upended the entire Middle East and also weakened one of the biggest adversaries [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=330.32s)]
*  of the United States in the Middle East, Iran. But we will be watching this carefully to see [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=337.2s)]
*  implementation follow through. But a big diplomatic win for him, just to get to this point, now we have [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=341.28s)]
*  to watch the implementation of it. Margot, Brendan laying out the headline here on a breakthrough [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=346.88s)]
*  ceasefire deal agreement between Israel and Hamas. And as you just laid out, Margot, though, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=352.8s)]
*  it is tenuous. Forty-two days of a ceasefire where we could see hostages released as early as this [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  Sunday, but there are so many components to it. Stay close with us. We want to cross over now [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  to CBS News foreign correspondent Remy Inosensio. He's been on the ground covering this war from [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=368.0s)]
*  both sides since the beginning. He joins us from Tel Aviv. And I know, Remy, you've been in contact [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=373.84s)]
*  with many relatives of hostages and other victims. I'm curious what they've been telling you lately [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=379.52s)]
*  as we've been hearing that this deal could be imminent and what you're hearing from them today. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=385.76s)]
*  Errol, yes, that's right. In terms of the reaction that I'm getting from some families of hostages [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=392.08s)]
*  I'm texting right now is that there is relief coming from many, as you would expect. But from one [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=398.64s)]
*  complication, the older brother of the hostage, Evitar David, Elie David, who I spoke to in Jerusalem, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=405.12s)]
*  just messaged me and said, it's complicated. He says, I hate this deal because his brother and [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=412.88s)]
*  21 other men are actually not on this list of the 33. Of course, he is hoping that there's a [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=419.28s)]
*  comprehensive deal here. But this is showing the cynicism that people have been thinking about when [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=424.4s)]
*  it comes to Hamas in its dealings with Israel. The relief, no doubt, that many people are feeling [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=432.4s)]
*  here mixed with, you would imagine, emotional torture, if you will, over the past 466 days, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=439.28s)]
*  ever since the events of October 7, 2023. You can also imagine that this is not just one generation. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=448.88s)]
*  We're talking generational trauma here from hostages as young as one year old to [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=454.8s)]
*  hostages as old as 85 years old. Another brother of another hostage, Michael Levy, talked about his [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=462.0s)]
*  brother Orlevy, who was abducted from the Nova Music Festival. I asked him, how does he keep hope [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=470.08000000000004s)]
*  alive? He said that's the only thing that he can actually hold onto. He also said, talking about the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=475.36s)]
*  intergenerational anxiety, he said that while his brother was abducted, hopefully still alive, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=482.72s)]
*  his brother's wife was killed in the events of October 7 when a grenade was hurled into her [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=488.96000000000004s)]
*  shelter. But their three-year-old son, Almag, turned three years old without his parents. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=499.12s)]
*  I asked Michael, Almag's uncle, if he was asking less about his parents. He didn't say that they [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=505.44000000000005s)]
*  were asking less about him, but that he was actually forgetting faces, thinking that strangers [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=512.48s)]
*  were actually his parents. So this is the ebb and the flow of the emotions that have been happening [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=516.5600000000001s)]
*  here. No doubt a lot of relief, but again, talking, messaging with some of the hostage families right [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=521.6800000000001s)]
*  now, as one says, it's complicated because of course everyone wants to see all of their families, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=526.88s)]
*  all of these hostages home immediately. And that's understandable. And Remy, you made a point about [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=532.0s)]
*  these first 33. We understand, according to details from earlier today, that that would [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=536.32s)]
*  include women, children and older hostages. Margaret Brennan mentioned Keith Siegel among [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=541.68s)]
*  them. He's an Israeli-American. CBS News spoke with his wife. I spoke with his wife Aviva [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=546.88s)]
*  months ago. She's 63 now. He's 64. And while she was a hostage and released a month later during [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=552.2399999999999s)]
*  the first hostage release, she worries about his psychological state, which is so understandable. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=559.04s)]
*  Can you give us a quick update on the latest on the fighting? Because that, of course, has continued [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=566.3199999999999s)]
*  this entire time. Yes, the fighting that has continued on in Gaza has been actually ramping [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=571.12s)]
*  up over the past few days. Our CBS News team in Gaza has been messaging us saying that they feel [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=580.88s)]
*  it might be Israel's attempt to try to destroy as much of Hamas as it has been trying to do over the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=588.32s)]
*  past 15 months before any kind of deal has been clinched. But even in just the past hour or so, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=595.28s)]
*  we even got reports of the killing of the deaths of a few more journalists. Tragic in that this [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=602.3199999999999s)]
*  has happened just as this deal has been reached. But when you look across the whole entire 15 months, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=608.0799999999999s)]
*  the death toll from the Hamas Run Health Ministry is pushing 47,000 people over nearly 470 days. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=616.32s)]
*  You can do the math there. So many people losing their lives, men, women, and children. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=625.5200000000001s)]
*  We have been talking about the hostage families. And to your question, it is so important to look [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=631.0400000000001s)]
*  across just miles south of where I'm standing here in Tel Aviv with the devastation, with the [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=637.7600000000001s)]
*  destruction that you are seeing on your screens right now that have been continuing in Israel's [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=642.96s)]
*  avowed promise to destroy Hamas, still very much clearly intact as we see them very apparent [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=648.88s)]
*  in negotiations that have finally, as we see, come to the ceasefire right now. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=656.5600000000001s)]
*  Remy, you know, Sencio giving us the latest from Tel Aviv on this breaking news. Remy, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=660.8000000000001s)]
*  thank you. And we are standing by for a press conference update of sorts out of Qatar. This [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZqUkzY0tY&t=664.72s)]
