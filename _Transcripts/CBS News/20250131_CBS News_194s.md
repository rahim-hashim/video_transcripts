# Small medical transport plane crashes in Philadelphia
**CBS News:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE)
*  We have been watching our local CBS News coverage on a small plane crash in Philadelphia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=0.0s)]
*  It took off from Northeast Philadelphia from the airport there for Springfield, Missouri. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=5.24s)]
*  And our station there reports that this was a private medical transport plane that went [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=11.28s)]
*  down. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=16.32s)]
*  We know at least two people were on board. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=17.32s)]
*  We're hearing reports of injuries on the ground. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=19.12s)]
*  CBS News transportation safety expert and analyst Robert Semmwalt joins us now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=21.48s)]
*  He's also former chair of the National Transportation Safety Board. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  We're still getting information in. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=28.56s)]
*  What will emergency crews and investigators be doing in these first stages? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=32.12s)]
*  The biggest challenge right now is to extinguish the fire and make sure that the area is safe. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=35.6s)]
*  We know some of the conditions. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=42.260000000000005s)]
*  It was rainy at the time. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=43.8s)]
*  We also know that the crash happened only minutes after takeoff. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=45.68s)]
*  We've been hearing coverage that that means that the fuel tank will have been full. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=48.92s)]
*  What else does that tell you? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=53.6s)]
*  Well, you're right. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=54.92s)]
*  It's a big fireball. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=56.040000000000006s)]
*  And so I think that the challenge, of course, is going to be to find any black boxes that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=57.48s)]
*  might be on board the airplane. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=63.16s)]
*  And they can usually survive a big inferno, but that will be a challenge, I think, initially. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=65.32s)]
*  Of course, our viewers will be used to hearing talk of black boxes. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  Why is that so significant in an investigation like this? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=74.8s)]
*  If it's a cockpit voice recorder, it provides the most direct evidence of what's going on [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=77.0s)]
*  inside that cockpit. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=81.88s)]
*  So that one is key. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=83.58s)]
*  The flight data recorder records hundreds or thousands of flight parameters. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=85.76s)]
*  And so both of those are critical to unlocking these mysteries. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  Okay, important data there. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  So small plane crashes, we know, are a little more common than commercial crashes. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=95.28s)]
*  This year there was a crash in California last week. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=99.4s)]
*  Days earlier, a single engine plane crash in Nevada. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  Why do we see this happen more frequently? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, there's a different standard, regulatory standard, for commercial airlines versus general [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=107.28s)]
*  aviation. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=113.68s)]
*  Commercial aviation is everything other than military or airlines. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  So the regulatory requirements are not as stringent. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  The maintenance requirements may not be as stringent. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  The pilot training requirements may not be as stringent. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=125.68s)]
*  So that is one factor, about three factors right there. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=128.20000000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=132.44s)]
*  Some people may be watching this, they may be feeling very disconcerted. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=133.44s)]
*  Obviously this happening two days after such a tragedy happening near Washington, D.C. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=136.56s)]
*  What is your message to people? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=141.24s)]
*  Well, flying certainly on an airline is very, very safe. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=144.64s)]
*  And I say that in spite of the disaster that occurred two nights ago. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=149.88s)]
*  Even general aviation, like we're dealing with here in this particular crash, is pretty [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=155.48s)]
*  darn safe. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=160.88s)]
*  But be selective about who you're flying with if you're going out for general aviation. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=162.24s)]
*  Make sure that you know who you're flying with and that the airplane is well maintained. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=167.72s)]
*  I think those are important factors to consider. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=171.76s)]
*  Anything else you think we should know here on these initial stages? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=174.56s)]
*  Well, it is all initial. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=177.48s)]
*  And so usually what I've found in my 15 years at the NTSB is that whatever we hear now is [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  probably going to be inaccurate. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=184.88s)]
*  So just let the facts settle down a bit and then facts will emerge. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=186.84s)]
*  Robert Sumwalt, thank you so much. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVHtDVaWpQE&t=192.35999999999999s)]
