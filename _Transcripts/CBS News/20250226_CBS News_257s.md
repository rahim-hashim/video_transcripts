# Child dies after contracting measles in Texas, officials say
**CBS News:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY)
*  We've got some breaking news to report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=0.0s)]
*  The Associated Press is reporting now that one person has died from the measles outbreak [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=2.68s)]
*  in West Texas. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=7.84s)]
*  We've obviously been tracking that outbreak there for several weeks, which has grown to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  more than 100 cases across nine different counties. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News correspondent Omar Villafranca, who's been tracking this [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=16.68s)]
*  story for the last couple of days for us. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=21.8s)]
*  Omar, what are you learning? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=24.28s)]
*  Tell me about this person, if you have any information about this person who's succumbed [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=25.8s)]
*  to this illness. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=31.04s)]
*  Well, right now, Vlad, Lubbock Covenant, which is the hospital here in Lubbock, it's a children's [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=32.84s)]
*  hospital. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=39.72s)]
*  A spokesperson for the hospital tells us that they are not confirming anything and they [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=40.72s)]
*  don't know where AP got that story, but they are telling us that there is a three o'clock [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=44.64s)]
*  press conference. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  We've also reached out to city officials, county health department officials, and state [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  health department officials. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  Everything is quiet right now. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=55.7s)]
*  They're not confirming anything or telling us everything. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=56.7s)]
*  Hopefully we'll learn before that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=58.900000000000006s)]
*  If not, hopefully at that three o'clock press conference. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=59.900000000000006s)]
*  Omar, I was watching your piece this morning on CBS Mornings, and as you know, we had Dr. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=62.38s)]
*  Celine Gounder on the talk about this. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=67.82000000000001s)]
*  I asked her in the break if we're to assume that the people who are stricken with measles [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=70.10000000000001s)]
*  in your reporting and the other reports that we've seen are folks who were unvaccinated, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=76.02000000000001s)]
*  because that seems to be a question that I'm never clear on. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=80.54s)]
*  Are people getting this because they're not vaccinated, because their children are not [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=83.42s)]
*  vaccinated? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=86.98s)]
*  Well, what we said in that story, but is this started in an unvaccinated Mennonite community [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=87.98s)]
*  that's in Gaines County, County seat being seminal here in West Texas. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=94.42s)]
*  So that's a community religious and their choice is to not get vaccinated really for [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=100.3s)]
*  anything. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=106.14s)]
*  They don't have to go to public schools. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=107.14s)]
*  They homeschool. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=108.18s)]
*  So that requirement, there's no exemption that's needed because they don't go to public [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=109.18s)]
*  schooling. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=113.3s)]
*  Most of them are homeschooled. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=114.3s)]
*  The majority of the cases that have happened in Gaines County are from that Mennonite [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=115.42s)]
*  community. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=120.94s)]
*  The thing is they interact with the general public. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=121.94s)]
*  They'll go to a big box store, Walmart to grab groceries. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=124.1s)]
*  They'll go to grab supplies in other places. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=127.3s)]
*  And that's where they will run into people. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=129.62s)]
*  Now, some of the early numbers that we saw from the state is that most of is hitting [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=131.34s)]
*  children in the community, 17 and under. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=135.26s)]
*  I mean, I'm talking a majority of the cases are children. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=138.5s)]
*  People who are getting it, who are not part of the Mennonite community could be getting [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=142.17999999999998s)]
*  it if they were not vaccinated themselves. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=145.45999999999998s)]
*  We've seen vaccination rates drop several points here over the last 10 years, almost [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  10 percentage points. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=153.18s)]
*  So that is going to have an effect. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=154.66s)]
*  And I'm sure Dr. Gounder said the best way to fight the measles is getting the vaccine. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=156.14s)]
*  It's much better than other vaccines to compare it to COVID. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=161.78s)]
*  You could get a COVID shot, but you could still get COVID. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=165.12s)]
*  And the symptoms wouldn't be as bad. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=168.14s)]
*  If you get the measles vaccine, there's a 97 percent chance you will not even get measles. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=170.18s)]
*  If you happen to get a breakthrough case, you will not be able to transmit it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=175.06s)]
*  So that's why health officials across the country, really here in the state right now, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=179.94s)]
*  are opening up testing, but also having the vaccine readily available for people who want [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=183.5s)]
*  it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=188.74s)]
*  And so the question, of course, becomes what are health officials saying about how they [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=190.38s)]
*  are working to contain this outbreak? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=194.62s)]
*  The other thing that Dr. Gounder told me, which was sort of interesting, is that once [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=198.5s)]
*  you have measles, actually it weakens the immune system so much that you are now susceptible [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=201.57999999999998s)]
*  to a whole host of other illnesses that might come afterwards. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=206.29999999999998s)]
*  Well, right now what they're doing is pushing testing in certain counties that are a high [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=210.54s)]
*  hit and also having clinics where people can go in and get the vaccine. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=216.62s)]
*  In Lubbock here, they told us last week they were averaging roughly 20 people a day coming [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=221.14s)]
*  in to get the measles vaccine, which is a pretty good number for people to come in. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=225.42s)]
*  Mind you, this is happening as state lawmakers are meeting in Austin, and they meet once [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=231.14s)]
*  every two years. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=234.57999999999998s)]
*  So I can guarantee you state health commissioners are talking to lawmakers to see about what [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=236.06s)]
*  can be done, because while they're meeting in Austin, this is the biggest measles outbreak [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=241.06s)]
*  in more than 30 years in Texas, and it's happening in West Texas. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=245.5s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=248.82s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=249.82s)]
*  Omar Villafranca on the story for us this morning. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=250.82s)]
*  Thank you, Omar, for jumping in front of the camera with the breaking news. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=252.22s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4z7zQZflRY&t=254.54s)]
