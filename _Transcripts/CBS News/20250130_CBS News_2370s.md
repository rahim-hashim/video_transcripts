# Trump takes questions on deadly midair plane crash in Washington, D.C. | full video
**CBS News:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA)
*  a glimpse of President Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=0.0s)]
*  We expect to hear his first remarks on this tragedy over the Potomac. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2.16s)]
*  Let's listen in. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=6.42s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  I speak to you this morning in an hour of anguish for our nation. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=25.96s)]
*  Just before 9 p.m. last night, an American Airlines regional jet carrying 60 passengers [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=32.2s)]
*  and four crew collided with an Army Blackhawk helicopter carrying three military service [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=37.620000000000005s)]
*  members over the Potomac River in Washington, D.C., while on final approach to Reagan National [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=43.44s)]
*  Airport. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=50.2s)]
*  Both aircraft crashed instantly and were immediately submerged into the icy waters of the Potomac. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=51.58s)]
*  Real tragedy. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=58.22s)]
*  The massive search and rescue mission was underway throughout the night, leveraging [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=59.94s)]
*  every asset at our disposal and I have to say the local, state, federal, military, including [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=64.53999999999999s)]
*  the United States Coast Guard in particular, they've done a phenomenal job. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=71.38s)]
*  So quick, so fast. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=76.5s)]
*  It was mobilized immediately. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=78.14s)]
*  The work has now shifted to a recovery mission. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=81.72s)]
*  Sadly, there are no survivors. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=86.58s)]
*  This was a dark and excruciating night in our nation's capital and in our nation's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=90.5s)]
*  history and a tragedy of terrible proportions. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=95.22s)]
*  As one nation, we grieve for every precious soul that has been taken from us so suddenly [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=100.7s)]
*  and we are a country of really, we are in mourning. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=107.42s)]
*  This is really shaking a lot of people, including people very sadly from other nations who were [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=112.14s)]
*  on the flight. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=117.9s)]
*  For the family members back in Wichita, Kansas, here in Washington, D.C., and throughout [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=119.86s)]
*  the United States and in Russia, we have a Russia contingent, some very talented people, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=124.46s)]
*  unfortunately, were on that plane. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=131.82s)]
*  Very, very, very sorry about that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=133.5s)]
*  Whose loved ones were aboard the passenger jet, we can only begin to imagine the agony [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=136.01999999999998s)]
*  that you're all feeling. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=141.54s)]
*  Nothing worse. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=144.1s)]
*  On behalf of the First Lady, myself, and 340 million Americans, our hearts are shattered [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=145.9s)]
*  alongside yours and our prayers are with you now. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=150.54000000000002s)]
*  And in the days to come, we'll be working very, very diligently in the days to come. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=154.34s)]
*  We're here for you to wipe away the tears and to offer you our devotion, our love, and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=159.10000000000002s)]
*  our support. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=164.10000000000002s)]
*  There's great support. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=165.10000000000002s)]
*  In moments like this, the differences between Americans fade to nothing compared to the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=167.18s)]
*  bonds of affection and loyalty that unite us all, both as Americans and even as nations. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=172.78s)]
*  We are one family, and today we are all heartbroken. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=179.57999999999998s)]
*  We're all searching for answers. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=183.26s)]
*  That icy, icy Potomac, it was a cold, cold night, cold water. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=186.66s)]
*  We're all overcome with the grief for many who have so tragically perished will no longer be with us. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=193.89999999999998s)]
*  Together we take solace in the knowledge that their journey ended not in the cold waters of the Potomac, but in the warm embrace of a loving God. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=200.62s)]
*  We do not know what led to this crash, but we have some very strong opinions and ideas. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=209.22s)]
*  And I think we'll probably state those opinions now. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=215.22s)]
*  Because over the years, I've watched as things like this happen and they say, well, we're always investigating. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=217.54s)]
*  And then the investigation three years later, they announce it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=223.94s)]
*  We think we have some pretty good ideas. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=226.57999999999998s)]
*  But we'll find out how this disaster occurred and we'll ensure that nothing like this ever happens again. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=229.82s)]
*  The FAA and the NTSB and the US military will be carrying out a systematic and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=236.9s)]
*  comprehensive investigation our new Secretary of Transportation, Sean Duffy, is second day on the job. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=242.94s)]
*  When that happens, it's a rough one. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=251.78s)]
*  We'll be working tirelessly. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=256.02s)]
*  He's a great gentleman. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=257.38s)]
*  The whole group is, these are great people. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=258.38s)]
*  And they are working tirelessly to figure out exactly what happened. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=261.65999999999997s)]
*  We will state certain opinions, however. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=266.58s)]
*  I'm also immediately appointing an acting commissioner to the FAA, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=268.46s)]
*  Christopher Rochelieu, a 22 year veteran of the agency, highly respected. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=273.38s)]
*  Christopher, thank you very much. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=280.58s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=282.09999999999997s)]
*  We must have only the highest standards for those who work in our aviation system. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=283.53999999999996s)]
*  I changed the Obama standards from very mediocre at best to extraordinary. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=287.46s)]
*  You remember that only the highest aptitude, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=294.5s)]
*  they have to be the highest intellect and psychologically superior people, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=299.38s)]
*  were allowed to qualify for air traffic controllers. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=305.54s)]
*  That was not so prior to getting there when I arrived in 2016. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=309.66s)]
*  I made that change very early on because I always felt this was a job that, and other jobs too, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=315.7s)]
*  this was a job that had to be superior intelligence. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=321.02000000000004s)]
*  And we didn't really have that and we had it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=324.5s)]
*  And then when I left office and Biden took over, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=328.98s)]
*  he changed them back to lower than ever before. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=332.78000000000003s)]
*  I put safety first. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=338.62s)]
*  Obama, Biden, and the Democrats put policy first. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=340.06s)]
*  And they put politics at a level that nobody's ever seen [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=343.7s)]
*  because this was the lowest level. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=350.46s)]
*  Their policy was horrible and their politics was even worse. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=352.53999999999996s)]
*  So as you know, last week, long before the crash, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=357.78s)]
*  I signed an executive order restoring our highest standards for air traffic controllers [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=360.21999999999997s)]
*  and other important jobs throughout the country. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=365.74s)]
*  So it was very interesting. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=367.65999999999997s)]
*  About a week ago, almost upon entering office, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=369.38s)]
*  I signed something last week that was an executive order, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=375.46000000000004s)]
*  very powerful on restoring the highest standards of air traffic controllers and others, by the way. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=380.46000000000004s)]
*  Then my administration will set the highest possible bar for aviation safety. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=386.82s)]
*  We have to have our smartest people. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=390.98s)]
*  It doesn't matter what they look like, how they speak, who they are. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=393.38s)]
*  It matters intellect, talent, the word talent. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=397.18s)]
*  They have to be talented, naturally talented geniuses. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=401.06s)]
*  You can't have regular people doing that job. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=405.62s)]
*  They won't be able to do it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=407.62s)]
*  But we'll restore faith in American air travel. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=409.94s)]
*  I'll have more to say about that. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=412.3s)]
*  I do want to point out that various articles that appeared prior to my entering office. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=414.34000000000003s)]
*  And here's one. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=422.3s)]
*  The FAA's diversity push includes focus on hiring people [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=424.42s)]
*  with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=428.3s)]
*  That is amazing. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=434.26s)]
*  And then it says FAA says people with severe disabilities, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=435.74s)]
*  the most underrepresented segment of the workforce, and they want them in and they want them. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=439.54s)]
*  They can be air traffic controllers. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=445.58000000000004s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=447.54s)]
*  This was in January 14th. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=448.94s)]
*  So that was a week before I entered office. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=452.06s)]
*  They put a big push to put diversity into the FAA's program. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=455.58000000000004s)]
*  And then another article, the Federal Aviation Administration. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=461.58s)]
*  This was before I got to office, recently second term. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=466.42s)]
*  The FAA is actively recruiting workers who suffer severe intellectual disabilities, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=472.82s)]
*  psychiatric problems, and other mental and physical conditions [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=479.82s)]
*  under a diversity and inclusion hiring initiative spelled out on the agency's website. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=483.1s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=488.86s)]
*  These are people that are, I mean, actually their lives are shortened [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=489.94s)]
*  because of the stress that they have. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=495.58000000000004s)]
*  Brilliant people have to be in those positions. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=499.78000000000003s)]
*  And their lives are actually shortened, very substantially shortened because of the stress [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=502.98s)]
*  where you have many, many planes coming into one target. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=507.5s)]
*  And you need a very special talent and a very special genius to be able to do it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=511.22s)]
*  Targeted disabilities are those disabilities that the federal government, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=517.7s)]
*  as a matter of policy, has identified for special emphasis in recruitment and hiring. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=521.34s)]
*  The FAA's website states they include hearing, vision, missing extremities, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=526.46s)]
*  partial paralysis, complete paralysis, epilepsy, severe intellectual disability, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=533.26s)]
*  psychiatric disability, and dwarfism. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=539.02s)]
*  All qualify for the position of a controller of airplanes [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=542.0999999999999s)]
*  pouring into our country, pouring into a little spot, a little dot on the map, a little runway. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=549.0999999999999s)]
*  The initiative is part of the FAA's diversity and inclusion hiring plan. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=556.6199999999999s)]
*  Think of that. The initiative is part of the FAA's diversity and inclusion hiring plan, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=560.9799999999999s)]
*  which says diversity is integral to achieving FAA's mission of ensuring safe and efficient travel. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=566.9s)]
*  I don't think so. I don't think so. I think it's just the opposite. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=573.06s)]
*  The FAA website shows that the agency's guidance on diversity hiring [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=576.9s)]
*  were last updated on March 23rd of 22. They wanted to make it even more so. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=582.22s)]
*  And then I came in, and I assume maybe this is the reason. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=588.06s)]
*  The FAA, which is overseen by Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a real winner. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=592.38s)]
*  That guy's a real winner. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=599.06s)]
*  Do you know how badly everything's run since he's run the Department of Transportation? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=600.14s)]
*  He's a disaster. He was a disaster as a mayor. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=604.9s)]
*  He ran his city into the ground, and he's a disaster now. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=609.3s)]
*  He's just got a good line of bullshit. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=613.3s)]
*  The Department of Transportation, his government agency charged [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=616.74s)]
*  with regulating civil aviation. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=621.02s)]
*  Well, he runs it 45,000 people and he's run it right into the ground with his diversity. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=622.8199999999999s)]
*  So I had to say that it's terrible. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=629.54s)]
*  Then it's a group within the FAA, another story, determined that the workforce was too white, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=633.46s)]
*  that they had concerted efforts to get the administration to change that and to change it immediately. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=640.6999999999999s)]
*  This was in the Obama administration just prior to my getting there. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=649.66s)]
*  And we took care of African Americans, Hispanic Americans. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=654.46s)]
*  We took care of everybody at levels that nobody's ever seen before. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=658.3s)]
*  It's one of the reasons I won. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=661.7s)]
*  But they actually came out with a directive, too white. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=663.94s)]
*  And we want the people that are competent. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=667.42s)]
*  But now we mourn and we pray and would like to ask all Americans to join me in a moment of silence [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=671.62s)]
*  as we ask God to watch over those who have lost their lives and bring comfort to the loved ones. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=677.66s)]
*  And I just want to say God bless everyone in this room. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=683.86s)]
*  This has been a terrible, very short period of time. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=687.5799999999999s)]
*  We'll get to the bottom of it. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=692.9399999999999s)]
*  So we all saw the same thing. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=695.02s)]
*  We've seen it many times. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=697.3399999999999s)]
*  I've had the honor of hearing tapes. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=698.42s)]
*  Tapes are scary, very scary tapes. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=702.78s)]
*  You had a airliner coming in, American Airlines. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=707.66s)]
*  He was doing everything right. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=712.8199999999999s)]
*  He was on track. He was the same track as everybody else. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=714.66s)]
*  They came in. It's probably the same track as they've had for 25 years or more. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=717.38s)]
*  He's coming in the path. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=722.18s)]
*  And for some reason, he had a helicopter that was at the same height, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=724.54s)]
*  obviously, when they hit, but pretty much the same height. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=732.9s)]
*  And going at an angle that was unbelievably bad, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=736.3s)]
*  when the air traffic controller said, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=741.42s)]
*  Do you see? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=744.9799999999999s)]
*  You know, he's talking about, do you see him? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=745.62s)]
*  But there was very little time left when that was stated. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=748.14s)]
*  And then also he said, follow him in. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=751.38s)]
*  And then almost immediately after that, you know, seconds after that, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=753.8599999999999s)]
*  there was the crash that took place. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=759.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, you follow him in. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=761.3s)]
*  That means like everything's fine. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=762.6999999999999s)]
*  Follow him in. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=764.2199999999999s)]
*  You had a pilot problem from the standpoint of the helicopter. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=767.8199999999999s)]
*  I mean, because it was visual. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=773.54s)]
*  It was a very clear night. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=775.0999999999999s)]
*  It was cold, but clear and clear as you could be. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=777.66s)]
*  The American Airlines plane had lights blazing. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=782.42s)]
*  They had all their landing lights on. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=786.8199999999999s)]
*  I could see it from the Kennedy Center tape. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=789.14s)]
*  We had a tape up on the Kennedy Center. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=791.38s)]
*  That seems to be the primary. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=794.14s)]
*  That's why I'm sure we'll see other tapes, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=795.38s)]
*  because it's such an area where there are a lot of cameras, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=796.82s)]
*  a lot of cameras looking up into the air, into space. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=800.5400000000001s)]
*  So we'll probably see many other shots of it [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=805.02s)]
*  before too much time goes by. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=807.0600000000001s)]
*  But we had a situation where you had a helicopter [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=809.82s)]
*  that had the ability to stop. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=815.9000000000001s)]
*  I have helicopters. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=817.3000000000001s)]
*  You can stop a helicopter very quickly. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=818.7s)]
*  It had the ability to go up or down. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=821.58s)]
*  It had the ability to turn. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=823.7s)]
*  And the turn it made was not the correct turn, obviously. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=827.22s)]
*  And it did somewhat the opposite of what it was told. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=832.1800000000001s)]
*  We don't know that that would have been the difference [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=836.38s)]
*  because the timing was so tight. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=837.98s)]
*  It was so — it was so little. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=839.94s)]
*  There was so little time to think. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=842.38s)]
*  But what you did have is you had vision. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=844.6600000000001s)]
*  The helicopter had vision of the plane [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=847.6600000000001s)]
*  because you had vision of it all the way — [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=850.66s)]
*  perfect vision of it all the way from at Kennedy Center, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=852.34s)]
*  where the tape was taken. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=855.9s)]
*  And for some reason, there weren't adjustments made. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=858.38s)]
*  Again, you could have slowed down the helicopter substantially. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=861.5799999999999s)]
*  You could have stopped the helicopter. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=864.86s)]
*  You could have gone up. You could have gone down. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=866.18s)]
*  You could have gone straight up, straight down. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=867.98s)]
*  You could have turned. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=869.74s)]
*  You could have done a million different maneuvers. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=870.46s)]
*  For some reason, it just kept going [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=873.62s)]
*  and then made a slight turn at the very end. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=878.38s)]
*  And it was — by that time, it was too late. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=882.62s)]
*  They shouldn't have been at the same height [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=886.66s)]
*  because if it was at the same height, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=889.14s)]
*  you could have gone under it or over it, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=890.9399999999999s)]
*  and nobody realized — [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=892.78s)]
*  or they didn't say that it's at the same height. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=895.3399999999999s)]
*  At the same height, it would — still wouldn't have been great, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=898.18s)]
*  but you would have missed it by quite a bit. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=900.66s)]
*  Could have been 1,000 feet higher. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=902.8199999999999s)]
*  It could have been 200 feet lower. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=904.18s)]
*  But it was exactly at the same height, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=906.62s)]
*  and somebody should have been able to point that out. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=908.22s)]
*  So all of this is going to be studied, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=910.9s)]
*  but it just seems to me from a couple of words [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=912.74s)]
*  that I like to use the words, common sense, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=916.58s)]
*  some really bad things happened [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=920.74s)]
*  and some things happened that shouldn't have happened. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=924.0600000000001s)]
*  So you had a helicopter going in identical direction. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=927.54s)]
*  You had a helicopter that was at the exact same height [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=932.42s)]
*  as somebody going in essentially the opposite direction. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=935.54s)]
*  You had a plane that was following a track, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=939.34s)]
*  which is a track that every other plane followed. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=941.18s)]
*  And I don't imagine — I know I've heard today [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=944.5s)]
*  that they might have been following the preceding plane, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=947.58s)]
*  which was pretty close, but not that close — [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=949.78s)]
*  the preceding plane. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=952.94s)]
*  But you wouldn't have even been able to see that [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=953.94s)]
*  because of the direction that the helicopter was coming in at. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=955.74s)]
*  So you had a confluence of bad decisions that were made. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=958.54s)]
*  And you have people that lost their lives — [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=965.7s)]
*  violently lost their lives. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=970.02s)]
*  We're going to take a few questions. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=973.78s)]
*  I'd like to ask our new Secretary of Transportation [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=975.22s)]
*  to say a few words. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=978.74s)]
*  Sean Duffy, great gentleman, just started. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=979.62s)]
*  It's not your fault, and I know you agree with me [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=982.94s)]
*  very strongly on intellect [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=986.86s)]
*  and even psychological well-being [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=988.42s)]
*  of the air traffic control. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=991.74s)]
*  It's such an important position. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=993.34s)]
*  And I think I can't emphasize stronger. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=995.3s)]
*  I changed it when I first ran, in 2016. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=997.6999999999999s)]
*  I changed it. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1001.9s)]
*  We had the highest standard that you could have. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1003.0999999999999s)]
*  And then they changed it back. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1006.0999999999999s)]
*  That was Biden, to a standard you just — [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1009.26s)]
*  I read it to you. That was from one of your papers. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1012.3399999999999s)]
*  One of the people in this room actually wrote that. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1015.42s)]
*  And then I changed it back a few days ago. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1019.3s)]
*  And unfortunately, that was — we'll see. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1021.58s)]
*  We don't know that necessarily. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1028.94s)]
*  It's even the controller's fault. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1030.22s)]
*  But one thing we do know — there was a lot of vision, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1032.06s)]
*  and people should have been able to see that, you know, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1034.22s)]
*  at what point do you stop? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1037.18s)]
*  At what point do you say, wow, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1038.3400000000001s)]
*  that plane is getting a little bit close? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1039.46s)]
*  So this is a tragedy that should not have happened. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1041.5s)]
*  Please, Sean. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1044.82s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1047.26s)]
*  And I would just note the President's leadership [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1049.3400000000001s)]
*  has been remarkable during this crisis. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1052.7s)]
*  We have had a whole-of-government response — [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1055.42s)]
*  local, state, federal. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1057.9s)]
*  And when you see that kind of cooperation, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1060.14s)]
*  it begins with the leadership in this body. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1063.66s)]
*  So thank you for that, Mr. President. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1066.22s)]
*  You make our jobs a lot easier. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1067.5800000000002s)]
*  You made an important point that when we deal with safety, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1070.9s)]
*  we can only accept the best and the brightest [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1075.62s)]
*  in positions of safety [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1078.94s)]
*  that impact the lives of our loved ones, our family members. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1080.62s)]
*  And I think you make a really important point on that, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1084.66s)]
*  Mr. President. That is the motto of your presidency — [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1086.66s)]
*  the best and the brightest, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1089.7s)]
*  the most intelligent coming into these spaces. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1091.22s)]
*  I want to take a moment and extend my condolences [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1093.98s)]
*  to the families of the loved ones. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1097.1399999999999s)]
*  We commit to them that we are going to get [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1099.7s)]
*  to the bottom of this investigation, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1102.54s)]
*  not in three years, not in four years, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1105.1s)]
*  but as quickly as possible with the NTSB who is here today, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1106.82s)]
*  as well as the FAA. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1110.42s)]
*  What happened yesterday shouldn't have happened. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1112.42s)]
*  It should not have happened. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1115.42s)]
*  And when Americans take off in airplanes, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1117.3s)]
*  they should expect to land at their destination. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1120.1399999999999s)]
*  That didn't happen yesterday. That's unacceptable. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1123.58s)]
*  And so we will not accept excuses. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1126.92s)]
*  We will not accept passing the buck. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1129.78s)]
*  We are going to take responsibility [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1134.06s)]
*  at the Department of Transportation and the FAA [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1136.34s)]
*  to make sure we have the reforms [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1138.86s)]
*  that have been dictated by President Trump in place [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1140.46s)]
*  to make sure that these mistakes do not happen again. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1143.58s)]
*  And again, I want to thank you for your leadership, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1146.54s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1148.3s)]
*  And I appreciate the confidence you placed in me. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1149.66s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1153.42s)]
*  Pete. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1155.82s)]
*  Well, thank you, Mr. President. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1160.86s)]
*  Again, I want to echo what the Transportation Secretary said [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1162.42s)]
*  about your leadership from the moment we found out about this. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1165.38s)]
*  We were in contact with the White House [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1168.5s)]
*  trying to determine exactly what happened. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1169.86s)]
*  I would echo it as well. No excuses. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1172.46s)]
*  We're going to get to the bottom of this. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1174.06s)]
*  We first and foremost from the Defense Department [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1177.54s)]
*  want to pass our condolences to the 64 souls [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1179.42s)]
*  and their families that were affected by this. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1182.98s)]
*  Never should happen. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1186.18s)]
*  And certainly the three service members, the three soldiers, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1187.94s)]
*  young captain, staff sergeant and CW2 chief [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1191.6200000000001s)]
*  foreign officer, routine annual retraining of night flights [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1195.22s)]
*  on a standard corridor for a continuity of government mission. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1199.82s)]
*  The military does dangerous things. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1205.46s)]
*  It does routine things on the regular basis. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1206.94s)]
*  Tragically, last night, a mistake was made. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1209.98s)]
*  And I think the President is right. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1212.5800000000002s)]
*  There was some sort of an elevation issue [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1214.66s)]
*  that we have immediately begun investigating at the DOD [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1218.26s)]
*  and Army level. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1220.66s)]
*  Army CID is on the ground investigating. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1222.14s)]
*  Top tier aviation assets inside the DOD are investigating, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1224.74s)]
*  sir, to get to the bottom of it so that it does not happen again [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1228.5800000000002s)]
*  because it's absolutely unacceptable. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1232.0200000000002s)]
*  But I want to echo what the Transportation Secretary [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1233.5400000000002s)]
*  and you, Mr. President, said, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1236.66s)]
*  because it pertains to the DOD as well. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1238.5s)]
*  We will have the best and brightest [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1241.22s)]
*  in every position possible. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1242.98s)]
*  As you said in your inaugural, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1245.02s)]
*  it is colorblind and merit based. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1246.18s)]
*  The best leaders possible, whether it's flying blackhawks [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1249.94s)]
*  and flying airplanes, leading platoons or in government. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1252.86s)]
*  The era of DEI is gone at the Defense Department [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1257.14s)]
*  and we need the best and brightest, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1262.06s)]
*  whether it's in our air traffic control [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1263.18s)]
*  or whether it's in our generals [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1265.62s)]
*  or whether it's throughout government. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1267.62s)]
*  So thank you for your leadership and courage on that, sir. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1268.86s)]
*  And we'll stand by you on it. Thank you very much. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1271.3s)]
*  Jay, do you have a question? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1273.9399999999998s)]
*  Well, thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1278.58s)]
*  I just want to reemphasize something the President said [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1280.86s)]
*  and you've heard from the Secretary of Transportation [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1283.02s)]
*  and of Defense. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1285.6599999999999s)]
*  There really was a whole of government response. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1286.3s)]
*  We were all on the phone. We were all communicating yesterday, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1287.98s)]
*  trying to get to the bottom of this immediately, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1290.06s)]
*  but also try to communicate with the American people [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1292.22s)]
*  about what happened. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1294.78s)]
*  Something the President said that I think bears reemphasizing, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1296.38s)]
*  which is that when you don't have the best standards [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1299.8200000000002s)]
*  in who you're hiring, it means on the one hand, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1302.5400000000002s)]
*  you're not getting the best people in government, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1305.3000000000002s)]
*  but on the other hand, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1307.18s)]
*  it puts stresses on the people who are already there. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1308.3400000000001s)]
*  And I think that is a core part of what President Trump [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1311.42s)]
*  is going to bring and has already brought to Washington, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1314.2600000000002s)]
*  D.C., is we want to hire the best people [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1316.7800000000002s)]
*  because we want the best people at air traffic control [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1319.42s)]
*  and we want to make sure we have enough people [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1321.7s)]
*  at air traffic control [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1323.5800000000002s)]
*  who are actually competent to do the job. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1324.82s)]
*  If you go back to just some of the headlines [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1326.98s)]
*  over the past 10 years, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1328.58s)]
*  you have many hundreds of people suing the government [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1329.98s)]
*  because they would like to be air traffic controllers, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1332.86s)]
*  but they were turned away because of the color of their skin. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1334.6599999999999s)]
*  That policy ends under Donald Trump's leadership [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1337.5s)]
*  because safety is the first priority of our aviation industry. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1339.98s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1343.34s)]
*  Mr. President, on DEI and the claims that you've made, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1345.34s)]
*  are you saying this crash was somehow caused [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1349.54s)]
*  and the result of diversity hiring? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1352.54s)]
*  What evidence have you seen to support these claims? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1354.78s)]
*  It just could have been. We have a high standard. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1357.66s)]
*  We've had a much higher standard than anybody else. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1360.02s)]
*  And there are things where you have to go by brainpower, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1363.38s)]
*  you have to go by psychological quality. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1366.14s)]
*  And psychological quality is a very important element of it. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1370.74s)]
*  These are various very powerful tests that we put to use, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1374.02s)]
*  and they were terminated by Biden. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1377.1000000000001s)]
*  And Biden went by a standard that's the exact opposite. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1379.18s)]
*  So we don't know, but we do know that you had two planes [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1382.78s)]
*  at the same level. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1385.6200000000001s)]
*  You had a helicopter and a plane. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1386.66s)]
*  That shouldn't have happened. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1388.6200000000001s)]
*  And we'll see. We're going to look into that. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1390.1000000000001s)]
*  And we're going to see. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1392.26s)]
*  But certainly for an air traffic controller, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1392.9s)]
*  we want the brightest, the smartest, the sharpest. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1396.82s)]
*  We want somebody that's psychologically superior. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1399.26s)]
*  And that's what we're going to have. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1403.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1404.9s)]

*  When you have 60 planes coming in during a short period of time [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1742.94s)]
*  and they're all coming in different directions [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1747.3s)]
*  and you're dealing with very high-level computer — [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1749.5s)]
*  computer work and very complex computers. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1753.1000000000001s)]
*  And one of the other things I will tell you [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1756.34s)]
*  is that the systems that were built — [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1758.02s)]
*  I was going to rebuild the entire system, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1760.94s)]
*  and then we had an election [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1763.6200000000001s)]
*  that didn't turn out the way it should have. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1764.8600000000001s)]
*  But they didn't build the systems properly. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1767.18s)]
*  They spent a lot of money renovating a system, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1769.8600000000001s)]
*  spending much more money than they would have spent [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1772.3000000000002s)]
*  if they bought a new system for air traffic controllers, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1774.74s)]
*  meaning the computerized systems. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1777.18s)]
*  There are certain companies that do a very good job. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1779.94s)]
*  They didn't use those companies. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1782.46s)]
*  They used companies that should not have been doing it. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1783.74s)]
*  No, I think — I think this — [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1786.7s)]
*  I think it's very important to understand that for some jobs — [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1787.8999999999999s)]
*  and not only this, but air traffic controllers — [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1791.1399999999999s)]
*  they have to be at the highest level of genius. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1793.9799999999998s)]
*  I want to ask you about the ice skaters in a moment [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1800.74s)]
*  because the U.S. Ice Skating Committee was affected. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1802.34s)]
*  But first, if I can, the cited FAA tax that you read is real, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1804.2199999999998s)]
*  but the implication that this policy is new [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1807.86s)]
*  or that it stems from efforts that began under President Biden [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1809.86s)]
*  or the Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1812.6599999999999s)]
*  is demonstrably false. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1815.26s)]
*  It's been on the FAA's website. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1816.46s)]
*  The President is asking about the FAA's website. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1817.74s)]
*  The President is asking about the FAA's website. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1819.5s)]
*  It was there in 2013. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1820.18s)]
*  It was there for the entirety — [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1821.5800000000002s)]
*  The President is asking about the FAA's website. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1822.74s)]
*  It was there for the entirety of your administration, too. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1823.38s)]
*  So my question is, why didn't you change the policy [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1825.7s)]
*  during your first administration? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1828.26s)]
*  I did change it. I changed the Obama policy. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1829.22s)]
*  And we had a very good policy. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1832.1000000000001s)]
*  And then Biden came in and he changed it. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1833.5s)]
*  And then, when I came in, two days, three days ago, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1835.98s)]
*  I signed a new order bringing it [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1838.66s)]
*  to the highest level of intelligence. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1840.42s)]
*  Okay. Please. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1842.66s)]
*  The Press. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1844.8999999999999s)]
*  You mentioned that a vision was probably the problem [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1849.5s)]
*  that was at issue in this crash. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1853.34s)]
*  There's been some reports that one of the pilots [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1855.3s)]
*  in the helicopter may have been using night vision equipment. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1857.4199999999998s)]
*  Is there any indication? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1860.26s)]
*  The President. We don't know. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1861.34s)]
*  We're going to know that pretty soon. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1862.1399999999999s)]
*  It may change your view plane if you do have the night vision. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1864.26s)]
*  So it's very possible that could have happened. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1867.82s)]
*  That would be — that would be maybe a reason [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1870.9399999999998s)]
*  why you wouldn't actually see as well as on a clear night. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1873.02s)]
*  You can see sometimes better without it. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1876.58s)]
*  I have a couple more. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1878.26s)]
*  The Press. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1880.86s)]
*  Is it helpful to have your Secretary of Transportation [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1883.06s)]
*  confirmed and does this intensify your interest [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1885.26s)]
*  in getting other nominees confirmed quickly? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1887.54s)]
*  Can I go to what? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1889.26s)]
*  Is it helpful to have your Secretary of Transportation [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1890.98s)]
*  confirmed and does this intensify your interest [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1893.18s)]
*  in getting other nominees confirmed quickly as well? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1895.7s)]
*  Well, sure. We want fast confirmations. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1897.7s)]
*  And the Democrats, as you know, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1899.9s)]
*  are doing everything they can to delay them. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1902.06s)]
*  They've taken too long. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1904.06s)]
*  We're struggling to get very good people [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1906.06s)]
*  that everybody knows are going to be confirmed, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1909.54s)]
*  but we're struggling to get them out faster. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1911.98s)]
*  We want them out faster. It's a good question, actually. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1915.1s)]
*  We've been pushing Sean. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1918.26s)]
*  Everyone knows Sean for a long time. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1920.54s)]
*  We got many, many Democrat votes, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1923.1s)]
*  but they want to take as long as they can. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1924.6599999999999s)]
*  They ask questions like some of the questions [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1927.02s)]
*  that Peter would ask that were totally irrelevant [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1929.34s)]
*  and not very good questions, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1932.82s)]
*  but they want to just keep it going. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1934.18s)]
*  They want to keep it going as long as possible. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1935.6599999999999s)]
*  I was very honored, actually, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1937.58s)]
*  that you got so many Democrat votes. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1939.82s)]
*  That was really good. That was really good. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1941.4199999999998s)]
*  The Press. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1943.6599999999999s)]
*  When I applied to meet with the families [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1947.98s)]
*  and sent a question, is it your impression [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1950.94s)]
*  that a little training was done during that time? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1953.1399999999999s)]
*  The President. The what? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1956.46s)]
*  The training that the helicopter was involved in. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1957.1s)]
*  Is it anything you can tell us about that? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1960.26s)]
*  The President. You don't know. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1961.6599999999999s)]
*  These are the things that will come up with the investigation. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1962.34s)]
*  You don't know. But the helicopter, obviously, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1964.86s)]
*  was in the wrong place at the wrong time, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1967.06s)]
*  and a tragedy occurred. Please. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1970.06s)]
*  The Press. I've got a question about the — [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1972.06s)]
*  The President. No, go ahead. Please. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1974.9399999999998s)]
*  The Press. Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1975.6599999999999s)]
*  You've been critical of the current regulations, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1977.62s)]
*  and you've called for big reforms at FAA. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1980.98s)]
*  I'm curious, sir, what is — [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1985.1s)]
*  The President. Well, I made the reforms. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1986.26s)]
*  Three days ago, I made the reforms. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1987.78s)]
*  The Press. Yes, sir. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1989.3s)]
*  What is your message then to the American public [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1989.8600000000001s)]
*  in the weeks and months ahead? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1991.58s)]
*  Should they feel hesitant to fly? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1992.6200000000001s)]
*  And if you could clarify, perhaps, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1996.06s)]
*  something that the Defense Secretary said [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=1998.34s)]
*  when he said that this helicopter [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2000.06s)]
*  was on a continuity of government mission? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2001.66s)]
*  The President. I don't know what that refers to. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2005.22s)]
*  But they were practicing. They were. They do that. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2008.06s)]
*  They call it practicing. And they were. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2011.46s)]
*  And that's something that should be done. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2014.14s)]
*  It's only continuity in the sense [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2017.38s)]
*  that we want to have very good people, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2018.9s)]
*  and that has to be in continuity. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2020.5s)]
*  And that's what they refer to. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2023.1000000000001s)]
*  But it was basically practice, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2025.1000000000001s)]
*  and it was a practice that worked out very, very badly. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2027.14s)]
*  Okay? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2030.1000000000001s)]
*  The Press. Mr. President, on his question — [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2031.3s)]
*  the first question — should people be hesitant to fly right now? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2036.98s)]
*  The President. No, not at all. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2040.5s)]
*  I do not hesitate to fly. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2041.8600000000001s)]
*  This is something that — it's been many years [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2043.78s)]
*  that something like this has happened. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2046.58s)]
*  And the collision is just something [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2048.86s)]
*  that we don't expect ever to happen again. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2052.7400000000002s)]
*  We are going to have the highest-level people [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2055.26s)]
*  we've already hired — [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2058.42s)]
*  some of the people that you've already hired for that position. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2059.7s)]
*  Long before we knew about this — [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2062.54s)]
*  I mean, long before — from the time I came in, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2063.9s)]
*  we started going out and getting the best people, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2066.46s)]
*  because I said it's not — [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2068.98s)]
*  it's not appropriate what they're doing. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2070.94s)]
*  I think it's a tremendous mistake. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2072.58s)]
*  You know, they like to do things, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2074.14s)]
*  and they like to take them too far. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2076.26s)]
*  And this is sometimes what ends up happening. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2077.66s)]
*  You know, with that, I'm not blaming the controller. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2079.54s)]
*  I'm saying there are things that you could question, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2083.7s)]
*  like the height of the helicopter [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2085.98s)]
*  and the height of the plane being at the same level [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2087.66s)]
*  and going in opposite directions. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2089.5s)]
*  It's not a positive. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2090.94s)]
*  But, no, we're already hiring people. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2092.9s)]
*  No, it's safe — flying is very safe. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2095.1s)]
*  We have the safest flying anywhere in the world. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2096.78s)]
*  And we'll keep it that way. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2098.94s)]
*  Thank you all very much. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2100.1s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2102.9s)]
*  You have been watching a fairly high-wattage press conference [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2109.94s)]
*  there in the Brady briefing room with President Donald Trump, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2114.1s)]
*  two Cabinet Secretaries, and a brief appearance [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2118.14s)]
*  even from Vice President J.D. Vance. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2120.7000000000003s)]
*  The press conference began, as one might expect, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2123.7400000000002s)]
*  with condolences and sorrow, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2126.74s)]
*  words of comfort to the families of the 67 people [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2129.4599999999996s)]
*  believed to be dead at this hour after that mid-air collision. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2134.3399999999997s)]
*  And then the conversation turned — [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2137.4199999999996s)]
*  the president turned the conversation [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2140.18s)]
*  to what might have happened. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2141.7s)]
*  He called it a confluence of bad decisions. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2143.4199999999996s)]
*  And then the bulk of the commentary [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2146.14s)]
*  was about diversity, equity, and inclusion, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2147.8199999999997s)]
*  and an executive order that he signed a few days ago [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2151.62s)]
*  that he says corrected an FAA policy [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2155.62s)]
*  that was hiring people who were not qualified [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2158.66s)]
*  to be air traffic controllers. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2161.06s)]
*  But then at another point, he said, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2162.58s)]
*  didn't blame the air traffic controllers necessarily. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2164.18s)]
*  And he seemed to, in fact, be blaming maybe [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2166.98s)]
*  the pilots of the Army helicopter. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2169.14s)]
*  They were on the wrong path, he said, they should have seen. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2171.02s)]
*  It wasn't really clear by the end, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2174.66s)]
*  as I turned to our Edo Kiefer, who was listening along with me, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2176.46s)]
*  what the president thought in a firm way [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2179.46s)]
*  was at fault at this hour. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2182.42s)]
*  He said it could have been. He said he had common sense. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2185.34s)]
*  Didn't seem like he had firm conclusions, Ed. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2189.3s)]
*  No, Tony, he seemed to be jumping to conclusions [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2193.9s)]
*  before an investigation begins, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2196.86s)]
*  saying, I'm going to express my opinions, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2198.38s)]
*  knowing that it could take several years [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2200.7400000000002s)]
*  for an investigation to be completed. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2202.26s)]
*  Let's convey two pieces of information he shared. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2203.86s)]
*  First, he assured the flying public they should fly. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2206.1400000000003s)]
*  Second, that there will be a, quote, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2209.5s)]
*  systematic investigation led by the FAA, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2210.74s)]
*  the National Transportation Safety Board, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2213.06s)]
*  the Defense Department, to review what went on. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2214.7s)]
*  And he did name an acting administrator [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2217.2999999999997s)]
*  at the Federal Aviation Administration, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2219.3799999999997s)]
*  a guy named Chris Rocholo, a 22-year veteran [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2220.7799999999997s)]
*  who had been serving in a sort of active [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2223.7s)]
*  or acting role over the last several weeks [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2225.8199999999997s)]
*  because the then administrator and deputy [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2227.9799999999996s)]
*  quit earlier this month ahead of the Trump inauguration, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2230.4199999999996s)]
*  knowing they'd probably lose their job anyway. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2233.2599999999998s)]
*  But this focus on diversity, equity, inclusion programs [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2235.7s)]
*  is part of a big revamp of the federal policy [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2238.98s)]
*  and federal government that's underway, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2242.46s)]
*  going into agencies and saying, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2244.26s)]
*  if you've got any of these programs, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2245.66s)]
*  they're being canceled. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2247.34s)]
*  The people that run them are being put on paid leave [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2248.22s)]
*  for now, believing that across the federal government, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2250.22s)]
*  there's been too much focus on those kinds of issues [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2252.98s)]
*  and not on the actual work of the agencies themselves. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2256.22s)]
*  Whether he's inferring here that somebody was, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2259.42s)]
*  in fact, hired through that program is unclear, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2262.34s)]
*  but he's at least using that as one scapegoat [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2264.98s)]
*  in the early hours of this investigation, Tony. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2267.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it certainly sounded that way, Ed. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2270.8999999999996s)]
*  I'm reminded of the fact that from 2009, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2273.3799999999997s)]
*  the last deadly crash like this, to this one, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2275.4199999999996s)]
*  you had four different presidents [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2277.98s)]
*  who oversaw a remarkable stretch of safety in the skies. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2279.66s)]
*  They shared leadership during that time. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2284.06s)]
*  Now it seems like President Trump wants to put the blame [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2287.02s)]
*  on Biden and Obama, as he put it [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2289.62s)]
*  in this remarkable press conference. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2292.2999999999997s)]
*  We'll keep following it, Ed. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2293.7799999999997s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2294.8199999999997s)]
*  We've been watching a news conference [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2295.7s)]
*  by President Donald Trump in the aftermath of this tragedy [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2297.54s)]
*  over the Potomac, last night's midair collision [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2301.1s)]
*  between a regional jet and an army helicopter. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2303.74s)]
*  He said it's an hour of anguish for our nation, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2306.06s)]
*  and sadly, he reiterated, there are no known survivors. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2308.54s)]
*  Trump promised investigators we'll find out [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2312.7s)]
*  how this disaster occurred, and our coverage [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2314.46s)]
*  of this tragedy will continue on CBS Morning's [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2318.1s)]
*  your local news, and also, of course, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2321.02s)]
*  streaming on CBS News 24 seven. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2323.02s)]
*  You've been watching a CBS News special report. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2326.22s)]
*  The [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2329.5s)]
*  Welcome in on this Thursday. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2354.58s)]
*  I'm Elizabeth Cook. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2359.58s)]
*  On all of our minds today, the tragic news of that plane and helicopter crash near Washington, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2360.58s)]
*  D.C. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2365.98s)]
*  We heard from officials earlier today with an update. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2366.98s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPNAUW0aOA&t=2369.2599999999998s)]
