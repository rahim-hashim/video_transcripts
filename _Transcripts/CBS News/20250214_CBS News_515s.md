# Attorneys for Marc Fogel describe client's release from Russian captivity
**CBS News:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE)
*  Well, he spent 3 1‚ÅÑ2 years in a Russian in Russian captivity, his life on hold, hoping [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=0.0s)]
*  for a miracle. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=7.84s)]
*  Now, an American history teacher, Mark Fogle, is back on US soil with a chance to start [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  over again. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=14.9s)]
*  Everything changed for the Pennsylvania native in August of 2021. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=16.64s)]
*  Mark and his wife had flown back to Russia for their 10th and final year of teaching [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=20.82s)]
*  when Mark was detained in Moscow. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=25.32s)]
*  His family says he was carrying 17 grams of medical marijuana to treat his back pain. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=27.7s)]
*  Fogle was sentenced to 14 years in prison, what was finally released this week, and traveled [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=33.42s)]
*  to the White House to meet with President Trump there. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=39.18s)]
*  Fogle and his family, including his 95-year-old mother, say they feel blessed. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=41.9s)]
*  I feel like the luckiest man on earth right now. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  When Mark comes in, I think I'm going to feed him. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=50.1s)]
*  I'll make sure I have all the things he likes. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=54.620000000000005s)]
*  Strangers have said to me, are you Mark Fogle's mother? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=57.18s)]
*  They actually recognize me from being on the news, I guess. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=60.82s)]
*  But that is the truth. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=66.14s)]
*  I can't tell you how many people have asked me if I'm Mark's mother, and they're all praying [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=67.14s)]
*  for him. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=71.82s)]
*  And we have the two attorneys who work to secure his release. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=73.58s)]
*  They are Dmitriy Anafasiev, he joins us live from Moscow, and Martin DeLuca joining us [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=76.82s)]
*  live from Miami. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=81.82s)]
*  Thank you so much for being with us, gentlemen. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=82.82s)]
*  Martin, I want to start with you. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=84.86s)]
*  Take us through the moment. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=86.66s)]
*  You found out that Mark would be a free man. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=88.46s)]
*  Did he get a call from the president? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=90.82s)]
*  Who called you? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=92.97999999999999s)]
*  How did you find out? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=93.97999999999999s)]
*  Well, we were working on this for quite some time. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=96.17999999999999s)]
*  And so what ended up happening is that in the days leading up to the release, we had [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=101.06s)]
*  some noise. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=109.02s)]
*  We were coordinating across the board, and so we had some good visibility. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=110.9s)]
*  You're never sure until it actually happens. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=115.82000000000001s)]
*  So the first call I got was from the plane, 17 minutes after they cleared Russian airspace, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=118.9s)]
*  and they were on their way back to Washington. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=127.86s)]
*  And how is Mark feeling now that he's back on American soil? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=131.34s)]
*  Does he have any plans for the future at this point? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=134.9s)]
*  Too early to talk about plans for the future for him. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=138.86s)]
*  He's now at the State Department facility for readaptation when Americans that are wrongfully [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=141.46s)]
*  detained around the world are brought home. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=148.78s)]
*  So it's a facility that gives them time to recover, to have a lot of comfort, space, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=151.3s)]
*  therapy if necessary, and be close to and be together with your family and friends. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=158.78s)]
*  And that's what he's doing now. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=164.9s)]
*  And how long will he stay at that facility? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=166.70000000000002s)]
*  It's on a case-by-case basis. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=169.86s)]
*  So I would imagine probably through the weekend. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=171.70000000000002s)]
*  And Dmitry, I wanted to get to you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=175.86s)]
*  You're in Russia right now, and I understand you had a very personal connection to Mark Fogle. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=177.10000000000002s)]
*  Can you take us back to how you first got involved with this case? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=182.78s)]
*  Yeah, well, Mark is an excellent teacher. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=185.9s)]
*  And actually, the kids from the American school in Moscow asked my kids if I could represent [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=188.66000000000003s)]
*  Mark Fogle. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=194.5s)]
*  So the main reason why he is back home is because he's an excellent teacher. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=196.14s)]
*  Kids are his best advocates in the beginning. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=200.78s)]
*  But this week seems to be full of good news. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=203.82s)]
*  Mark is back home. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=207.22s)]
*  There's a chance for world peace. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=208.22s)]
*  And Philadelphia Eagles have scored a win because I'm an Eagles fan. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=210.34s)]
*  I used to spend time in Philadelphia. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=214.06s)]
*  And it's very exciting to me that it's happening right now. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=216.46s)]
*  And lots to celebrate in your household. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=219.46s)]
*  Well, I'm curious, did your children have a chance to talk to Mark after he got out? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=221.98000000000002s)]
*  Well, we had a wonderful video call with Mark and all the lawyers in a law firm just the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=225.98000000000002s)]
*  other day. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=233.10000000000002s)]
*  Well, my kids weren't part of that, but I look forward to us reconnecting at some point. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=234.46s)]
*  And that would be a very emotional event, I think. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=241.54000000000002s)]
*  Martin, I want to get back to you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=244.58s)]
*  When you think of Mark's case, you know, Brittany Greiner's story comes to mind because she [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=246.26000000000002s)]
*  was also imprisoned in Russia for medical marijuana possession. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=250.26s)]
*  She went on to be released in December of 2022. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=254.54s)]
*  And then last August, three Americans were released in the most significant swap with [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=257.54s)]
*  Russia since the end of the Cold War. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=262.46s)]
*  So leading up to each swap, how spark handling not being included in those releases? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=264.66s)]
*  Did he ever lose hope that he was ever going to be released? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=271.02s)]
*  He was devastated, but he never lost hope. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=275.5s)]
*  As you saw from his appearance in the diplomatic room in the White House, he's a guy with great [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=278.58s)]
*  spirit. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=286.97999999999996s)]
*  He is a symbol of perseverance because it really takes something to be passed up in [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=289.62s)]
*  three prisoners swaps. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=294.9s)]
*  It was actually three that they passed him up on during the Biden administration. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=295.97999999999996s)]
*  And it's inexplicable. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=301.65999999999997s)]
*  It's inexcusable. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=303.5s)]
*  The wrongful designation, the wrongful detention designation, which is required by law for [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=304.7s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=314.14s)]
*  government to focus resources and prioritize getting you out, didn't come for three years. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=314.62s)]
*  And there were many excuses during the Biden administration, but none of those excuses held [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=322.26s)]
*  any water, even when speaking about classified information that, of course, we can't discuss [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=329.14s)]
*  here. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=335.41999999999996s)]
*  None of those excuses held any water. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=336.62s)]
*  But the ultimate manifestation that they didn't hold any water was that the family ended up [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=338.62s)]
*  getting the official letter notifying them that Mark had been designated wrongfully detained [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=342.7s)]
*  the day after the U.S. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=350.74s)]
*  presidential election. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=352.53999999999996s)]
*  So that tells you a lot. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=353.82s)]
*  So I guess this is a question maybe for both of you. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=356.06s)]
*  What could this mean for the other Americans detained in Russia that are now fighting for [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=358.46s)]
*  their freedom? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=364.26s)]
*  Is this a renewed hope for their possible release? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=364.9s)]
*  From my perspective? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=370.38s)]
*  I'll start with you, Martin. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=374.09999999999997s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=375.02s)]
*  From my perspective, it's absolutely renewed hope because when countries like the United [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=375.94s)]
*  States and Russia are talking to each other, better, better things happen. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=381.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=385.85999999999996s)]
*  And Mark Fogel is now part of history because his release set the stage for the Ukraine [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=386.22s)]
*  peace negotiations. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=394.70000000000005s)]
*  Right. So we had, as Dimitri was saying, we've had a wonderful, wonderful week. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=395.94000000000005s)]
*  Mark got released on Tuesday. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=400.54s)]
*  President Trump and President Putin had their first substantive call. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=403.14000000000004s)]
*  I think it lasted over an hour and a half to discuss resolving the Ukraine conflict on [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=407.18s)]
*  Wednesday. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=411.98s)]
*  And today, Friday, the peace negotiations started in Munich, led by the vice president. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=413.42s)]
*  So it's been a spectacular week and it shows you what decisive leadership can do. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=421.5s)]
*  And it's I think a week that symbolizes what it means when when people talk about peace [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=426.42s)]
*  through strength. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=432.78000000000003s)]
*  Dimitri, I'm curious to know what your perspective is given that you are in Moscow right [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=434.1s)]
*  now. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=437.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, this is a very special case. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=438.38s)]
*  And I have to say that my American co-counsel, Martin DeLuca, did the heavy lifting [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=440.18s)]
*  because it's his brilliant strategy that allowed the family to be positioned in a way [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=444.66s)]
*  that Donald Trump was really caring about the fate of Mark Fogel. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=450.66s)]
*  It is only because of that that the ball has moved. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=456.34000000000003s)]
*  And my job was frankly the easiest part. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=459.5s)]
*  All I had to do is to convince the Russians that what Donald Trump cares about matters. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=461.42s)]
*  And I think that's not so difficult at the moment. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=465.94s)]
*  But, yeah, it's really working together that got us the success that we all were hoping [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=468.86s)]
*  for for several years. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=476.14000000000004s)]
*  And really in the last several months that we, Martin and I, started feeling that we [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=478.14000000000004s)]
*  actually have a realistic and pragmatic chance. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCJP_HUwvE&t=483.1s)]
