# The State Funeral of Former President Jimmy Carter | Special Report
**CBS News:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q)
*  This is a CBS News special report. I'm Nora O'Donnell in Washington. Good morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=0.0s)]
*  On this cold winter day, the nation is saying a final farewell to our 39th president, Jimmy Carter. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=26.96s)]
*  A motorcade is about to take Carter's casket from the Capitol to the National Cathedral, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=33.52s)]
*  and that's where his state funeral will begin one hour from now at 10 Eastern. Mr. Carter has lain [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=38.8s)]
*  in state in the Capitol rotunda since Tuesday evening. Thousands of mourners passed by his [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=44.8s)]
*  casket to pay final respects. Carter died on the last Sunday of December at the age of 100 years old. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=50.96s)]
*  State funerals began nearly one week ago with this casket passing through his hometown of Plains, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=59.6s)]
*  Georgia, his boyhood farm, then onto the Georgia state Capitol. Then the former president laid in [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=64.8s)]
*  repose at the Carter Center in Atlanta. This was a long-standing request of the Carters in order to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=70.8s)]
*  include the team that supported their work for peace and human rights. More than four decades, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=77.12s)]
*  the Carter Center has done that work. Two days ago, the 39th president arrived in the nation's [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=82.72s)]
*  Capitol one last time. His casket flew aboard a plane from the presidential fleet, and they dubbed [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=88.64s)]
*  it Special Air Mission 39 because he's the 39th president. There was an elegant and carefully [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=94.72s)]
*  planned funeral procession with a stop at the U.S. Navy Memorial to honor Carter's military [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=100.48s)]
*  career and then a service at the Capitol. And today, the cathedral will play host to yet another [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=106.72s)]
*  U.S. president's funeral. I must tell you, the National Cathedral, it has so much presidential [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=112.96s)]
*  history. Theodore Roosevelt helped lay the foundation stone in 1907, and George H.W. Bush [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=118.4s)]
*  oversaw the placement of the final stone atop the tower in 1990. It has hosted state funerals for [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=124.4s)]
*  presidents Eisenhower, Reagan, Ford, and then most recently, George H.W. Bush. Mr. Carter, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=131.6s)]
*  by the way, delivered one of the eulogies at the Ford funeral there, and today, President Biden [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=139.2s)]
*  will give one of the eulogies at the Carter family's request. You're looking now at live [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=145.04s)]
*  pictures of the U.S. Capitol as they begin this ceremony. Let's listen in. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=151.12s)]

*  A majestic and somber ceremony befitting the 39th president of the United States, that [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=367.76s)]
*  hymn that you heard there was My Faith looks up to the... [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=379.44s)]
*  And as you can see, the body-bearer team began moving through those many steps down the east [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=384.4s)]
*  front of the Capitol, where President Carter was the last of our presidents to deliver [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=389.48s)]
*  his inaugural address from the east side of the Capitol. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=394.65999999999997s)]
*  It's now on the west side these days. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=397.9s)]
*  The pallbearers have brought the casket into the hearse. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=401.32s)]
*  You can see members of the color guard there and the family watching this entire procession. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=406.52s)]
*  And then they will make their way down Pennsylvania Avenue and through our nation's Capitol to [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=415.21999999999997s)]
*  the Washington National Cathedral. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=419.65999999999997s)]
*  That grand and beautiful cathedral, one of the largest in the world, where there will [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=423.41999999999996s)]
*  be more than 3,000 people to attend that state funeral, and all of our living presidents [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=427.53999999999996s)]
*  will be there. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=434.61999999999995s)]
*  It will be incredible to see all of them together to pay tribute to former president Jimmy Carter. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=435.62s)]
*  I want to bring in our congressional correspondent, Nicole Killian. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=442.73999999999995s)]
*  She is there on Capitol Hill, Nicole. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=447.34s)]
*  Well, Nora, I think what is so remarkable about this moment is I think back to two days [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=451.74s)]
*  ago when President Carter's body was brought to the Capitol and we watched with poignant [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=457.38s)]
*  precision as his casket was carried up the steps into the Capitol rotunda. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=463.38s)]
*  Of course, we just witnessed them being brought back down. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=468.18s)]
*  And of course, now as he departs, it's just a few hours after sunrise and the dawning [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=471.62s)]
*  of a new day and really a new era for this country as we transition to life after the [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=477.46s)]
*  39th president. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=483.26s)]
*  It is his legacy of service that brought so many people out here to the Capitol over these [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=485.02s)]
*  last two days. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=491.18s)]
*  I spoke with a man who traveled all the way from Minnesota who said Jimmy Carter was the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=492.34s)]
*  first president he ever voted for, a grandmother with her 11-year-old grandson who was a fan [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=496.85999999999996s)]
*  of presidential history and admired Jimmy Carter for being a Sunday school teacher and building [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=502.82s)]
*  homes and a pastor that I spoke with who really applauded Jimmy Carter for wearing his faith [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=508.58s)]
*  on his sleeve. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=515.6999999999999s)]
*  And so just like in Georgia, where everybody has this personal connection to Mr. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=517.3399999999999s)]
*  Jimmy, so too did many people not only have personal connections, but also personal [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=522.18s)]
*  reflections on the 39th president. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=527.3s)]
*  And so whether for our viewers, whether people had an opportunity to get here to Washington [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=530.1s)]
*  or not today on this national day of mourning is really an opportunity for everyone to take [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=534.86s)]
*  that collective pause, that collective beat to reflect on the life and legacy of Jimmy [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=540.5799999999999s)]
*  Carter, not just a former president, but a humanitarian as well. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=546.9s)]
*  So beautifully said, Nicole Killian on Capitol Hill. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=552.66s)]
*  Thank you so very much. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=555.74s)]
*  Spring and Chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=557.46s)]
*  She is at the Washington National Cathedral. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=560.26s)]
*  Good morning, Nancy. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=563.5s)]
*  Good morning, Nora. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=566.62s)]
*  This majestic cathedral, the second largest in the United States, sixth largest in the [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=567.62s)]
*  world was designed to be a, quote, great church for national purposes. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=573.1s)]
*  And that is exactly the role it will play today. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=578.94s)]
*  3000 people are expected to attend this state funeral and Jimmy Carter will join the pantheon [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=582.44s)]
*  of presidents who, as you mentioned, have been eulogized here as well. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=591.24s)]
*  This will be the first time since 2018 that all of the living presidents will be face [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=595.96s)]
*  to face in one room. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=601.1800000000001s)]
*  Back then it was George H.W.'s state funeral that brought them together here also at the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=603.72s)]
*  National Cathedral. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=609.84s)]
*  It was a young Senator Biden who was one of Governor Jimmy Carter's earliest supporters [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=611.4399999999999s)]
*  for president back when he was a long shot candidate and they stayed close throughout [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=618.0s)]
*  the decades. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=622.52s)]
*  I was there in the Plains, Georgia, when the president and the first lady paid a visit [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=623.52s)]
*  to the Carters shortly before Rosalynn Carter passed away. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=628.5799999999999s)]
*  And President Biden has been asked to eulogize Jimmy Carter today. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=633.28s)]
*  He's been asked by the Carter family. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=638.92s)]
*  Two of the other eulogies, Nora, were actually written years ago by men who have since passed [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=641.3599999999999s)]
*  away. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=648.12s)]
*  One is the late President Carter's predecessor, President Gerald Ford. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=649.12s)]
*  The other is his vice president, Walter Mondale. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=655.4s)]
*  In fact, Ted Mondale said this week that he actually didn't know for years that his father [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=660.8s)]
*  had written a eulogy until he was contacted by the Carter Center. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=667.0400000000001s)]
*  They remained close throughout their lives. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=672.36s)]
*  And so the sons of Gerald Ford and Walter Mondale will be delivering their father's [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=674.48s)]
*  eulogies here at the National Cathedral today, which should be a very touching moment. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=680.2800000000001s)]
*  Incredibly touching moment. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=686.64s)]
*  And we are going to talk about that presidential odd couple of Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=688.2s)]
*  who Jimmy Carter defeated and then they became close friends and Carter speaking at Ford's [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=694.4s)]
*  state funeral as well. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=699.4s)]
*  Nancy Cordes, thank you so much. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=701.52s)]
*  Do want to note, too, at this time as we watch the motorcade make its way to the National [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=704.6800000000001s)]
*  Cathedral and we look at some of the dignitaries who are arriving to also talk about President [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=709.48s)]
*  Carter because he overcame brain and liver cancer in 2015. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=714.96s)]
*  I think we all know he died at the age of 100. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=720.44s)]
*  My son reading some of his obituaries, my young son said he was born in 1924, Mom. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=723.64s)]
*  You know, remarkable to think about anyone who makes it to 100 years old. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=730.5600000000001s)]
*  And Jimmy Carter talked a lot about not only his faith, but also about his legacy, how [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=734.9200000000001s)]
*  he wanted to be remembered and also about beating cancer. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=739.4s)]
*  And so after he was diagnosed with cancer that spread to his brain and liver while [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=742.88s)]
*  teaching Sunday school at his local church in Plains, Georgia, Mr. Carter spoke about [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=748.24s)]
*  how his battle for life helped mold his outlook on death. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=753.52s)]
*  Listen, I didn't ask God to let me live, but I just asked God to give me a proper attitude [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=758.72s)]
*  toward death. And I found that I was absolutely and completely at ease with death. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=764.68s)]
*  It didn't really matter to me. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=773.0799999999999s)]
*  Whether I died or lived, except I was going to miss my family and and miss the work at [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=775.88s)]
*  the court of son and miss teaching in Sunday school sometimes and so forth, all those [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=781.84s)]
*  delightful things. So anyway, anyway, that's what happened. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=787.2800000000001s)]
*  So I have since that time been absolutely confident that my Christian faith includes [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=790.96s)]
*  complete confidence in life after death. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=799.2s)]
*  So I'm going to live again. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=802.84s)]
*  Interesting to hear him talk about that complete confidence in life after death, that [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=806.32s)]
*  abiding faith that sustained Jimmy Carter through a hundred years. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=811.52s)]
*  We have an incredible team here with us today. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=816.28s)]
*  Those who knew Jimmy Carter covered his administration, studied his presidency and his [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=819.16s)]
*  life after. And let's start with our special guest, Bob Schieffer, who covered the White [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=824.4399999999999s)]
*  House during Jimmy Carter's presidency. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=828.92s)]
*  Schieffer was also the longtime host of Face the Nation. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=831.48s)]
*  Good morning, Bob. Good to see you again. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=835.96s)]
*  Good morning. And it's it's really almost what it is, an honor to be here and to be a [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=837.64s)]
*  part of this because Jimmy Carter was so on stage and and working throughout almost a [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=844.88s)]
*  half century. He didn't just serve as president. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=854.96s)]
*  And one time I said to Jimmy Carter, I said, you're the only person I know who was [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=860.1999999999999s)]
*  president, who did not consider the presidency the ideal high point of your life. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=865.16s)]
*  And he just laughed. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=873.4399999999999s)]
*  But he didn't he didn't challenge that because Carter understood and what he wanted to [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=875.64s)]
*  do was help people. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=881.52s)]
*  And I really believe that I believe him when he said that. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=883.76s)]
*  He believes so deeply in public service and just want to bring in now by phone President [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=887.9599999999999s)]
*  Carter's personal pastor, Tony Loudon. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=893.64s)]
*  He is in the motorcade right now with the Carter family. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=896.72s)]
*  And Tony, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=901.72s)]
*  I know you were the personal pastor for the Carters for six years. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=905.24s)]
*  Talk about what you learned from the former president. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=909.56s)]
*  I think that nor I think the biggest thing that learned was the fact that it's not for [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=913.8s)]
*  myself, but for country. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=919.4399999999999s)]
*  It was all about serving this nation all the way to the end. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=921.28s)]
*  Every time I would go to visit him, he would ask me three, four questions. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=925.56s)]
*  Where have you been? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=929.84s)]
*  What have you done? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=931.3199999999999s)]
*  Who have you helped? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=932.84s)]
*  And how can I help you help them? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=934.24s)]
*  And some days when he would have bad days and he wasn't feeling well, he'll just say, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=936.76s)]
*  where have you been? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=942.0s)]
*  And I know that he wants to ask all four questions. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=944.0s)]
*  So I have to answer all four questions to him. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=947.08s)]
*  He's one of the greatest serving leaders ever met in my entire life. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=949.88s)]
*  That's moving. Very like emotional to hear you say that story. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=954.4s)]
*  So focused on the other. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=957.4s)]
*  I know he changed your life. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=959.4399999999999s)]
*  How did he inspire you? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=961.88s)]
*  He forced me to take it to the next level, you know, as ministers and preachers and [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=965.2s)]
*  people who are believing their faith. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=969.64s)]
*  A lot of times we we put it on display in church and Bible study. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=971.88s)]
*  But he wanted what you learn to go outside the walls of the church, not [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=976.24s)]
*  discriminate against people, not use Christianity as a way to hate other people. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=980.88s)]
*  But look at ways of saying faith without works is dead. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=986.0s)]
*  Been along loving people, honoring people, loving your neighbors, caring about those [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=988.88s)]
*  who are downtrodden, even those who may not vote for you, but find a way to be able to [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=995.24s)]
*  show them compassion. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1002.16s)]
*  And he just. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1003.48s)]
*  I no longer look at life the way I used to. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1007.2s)]
*  I look at it as a way that my life belongs to our nation in this world to serve. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1009.52s)]
*  And I hope that those that are celebrating his life today, that today is not just a [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1015.6800000000001s)]
*  celebration, but our nation. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1020.88s)]
*  We pick up the mantle, we pick up the legacy of Jimmy Carter and we take it to the next [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1023.2s)]
*  level. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1028.28s)]
*  So beautifully said. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1030.96s)]
*  So beautifully said. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1032.2s)]
*  And what do you think about the service we're about to witness? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1033.2s)]
*  Yesterday, I had an opportunity to do a walkthrough through the National Cathedral. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1037.2s)]
*  And I just hope that our nation, our people get an opportunity to see this great [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1042.72s)]
*  celebration of this man's life. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1046.8000000000002s)]
*  But more importantly, our nation has come together, both Republicans, Democrats, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1049.72s)]
*  independents, our leaders who have come before him, presidents before him, our [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1054.92s)]
*  Supreme Court justices all in the same building honoring this great man. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1063.72s)]
*  But more importantly, I think that's God and Jimmy Carter got the gellity side that [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1069.0800000000002s)]
*  we can do this right before we select our leaders. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1076.24s)]
*  We can do this right before we have our inauguration. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1079.96s)]
*  We can do this right before we have a transitional of our government so that we can [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1082.84s)]
*  put faith and hope on display in our nation, so that our nation can have confidence [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1087.12s)]
*  in our government. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1093.84s)]
*  Make our nation truly a great place where we help others and be the shining light [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1097.1599999999999s)]
*  that we've always been in this nation. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1102.12s)]
*  Of course, he taught Sunday school himself and he spoke the word of God. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1106.76s)]
*  But he practiced the faith to describe how he did that. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1113.04s)]
*  Well, you know, I remember when he fell one day right before he was supposed to go [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1118.6399999999999s)]
*  to Tennessee to do his habitat bill. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1124.36s)]
*  And the Secret Service and staff told me to go into the hospital and tell him he [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1129.2s)]
*  shouldn't go to Tennessee. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1133.8799999999999s)]
*  But as I got there, I went into the room, I said, President Carter, I don't think [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1136.12s)]
*  you should go to Tennessee to bill. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1140.6s)]
*  He said, Listen, Tony, hospitals are just like prison. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1143.12s)]
*  They're easy to get into and hard to get out. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1146.68s)]
*  I need you to help me get out of this hospital so that I can keep my word and go [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1148.9199999999998s)]
*  billed home for those who need homes. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1155.0s)]
*  And the most amazing thing about all that, he had this big bandage on his on his eye [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1158.6399999999999s)]
*  over his eye and had a black eye. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1163.6399999999999s)]
*  And he was determined to get to Tennessee to keep his word. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1166.04s)]
*  And I believe that all the years that he put his left hand on the Bible and raised [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1170.76s)]
*  his right hand when he was a state senator, he did the same thing when he was in the [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1176.8400000000001s)]
*  Navy. He did the same thing when he was governor of Georgia. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1180.8s)]
*  And he did the same thing when he was president of the United States. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1184.56s)]
*  In his mind and in his spirit, he never took his hand off that Bible because he made [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1188.2s)]
*  a covenant with his gods that he was served his great nation and served the world. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1194.1200000000001s)]
*  And that's what he's doing today. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1199.76s)]
*  The Sunday School teacher has given us a lesson on faith and hope to be the guardrails [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1201.04s)]
*  of our democracy. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1207.12s)]
*  Reverend Tony Ladin, such an honor and a pleasure to speak with you and thank you for [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1210.92s)]
*  sharing so much about what we can all learn from the former president. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1217.36s)]
*  Our best wishes and prayers with you as well, because I know you are mourning today as [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1223.52s)]
*  well. Thank you, Nora. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1227.0s)]
*  I lost a friend. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1228.92s)]
*  I lost someone who I love. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1231.48s)]
*  But we're going to celebrate his life today. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1233.92s)]
*  Thank you, Laura. Have a good day. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1235.76s)]
*  I am overcome just because so beautifully put. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1239.92s)]
*  You know, Nora, one of the interesting things is as we watch the motorcade moving away [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1243.8000000000002s)]
*  from the Capitol, all three of the congressional leaders who spoke when the when the [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1249.48s)]
*  casket was brought into the Capitol for him to lie in state were all children. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1257.0s)]
*  Yeah, when he was elected president, John Thune, the Senate Majority Leader, was 16. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1262.88s)]
*  Pamela Harris, I think, was about 12. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1269.52s)]
*  And and the speaker of the House was about to turn about five. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1272.32s)]
*  That's not an original finding by me. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1277.08s)]
*  That Peter Baker of the New York Times figured that out. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1279.68s)]
*  And I thought, my goodness, what a great way to just underline how long he was. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1283.64s)]
*  He was so active. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1290.5600000000002s)]
*  I want to bring in 16 Minutes anchor Leslie Stahl, who served as CBS News White House [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1293.8000000000002s)]
*  correspondent during the Carter administration. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1299.0s)]
*  And she joins us now. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1302.1200000000001s)]
*  And Leslie, it is so good to see you and have you with us on this historic day. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1304.0400000000002s)]
*  What was it like covering the president? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1309.5600000000002s)]
*  And then, of course, you interviewed him many times in his post presidency. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1311.52s)]
*  Right. Well, when I got to the White House after Bob Schieffer in 1979, the country had [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1315.2s)]
*  already basically turned against him. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1322.6s)]
*  He had been very popular and then he was not so popular. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1325.44s)]
*  He lost some of what we might call the mantle of heaven. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1329.92s)]
*  Everything was going right. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1333.52s)]
*  And then everything went bad. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1334.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, I'm watching this and I'm thinking how sad that we have to die before people [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1336.8s)]
*  pay tribute. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1343.32s)]
*  He deserves what he's getting. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1345.52s)]
*  But all these years, he was looked upon as a weak president. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1347.32s)]
*  People say, oh, you don't want to be like Jimmy Carter if you're president. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1351.76s)]
*  But now we're really opening our eyes to what he accomplished and to what kind of a [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1355.52s)]
*  person, a man he was. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1361.8s)]
*  I love what the reverend said, because the country has come together, the left and the [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1363.52s)]
*  right, the whole country has come together at this very moment when we're about to [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1369.6399999999999s)]
*  inaugurate a new president in tribute of Jimmy Carter, who ended up in the end [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1375.28s)]
*  accomplishing so much more than we realized when he was president. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1383.52s)]
*  He turns out not to have been a weak president at all. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1388.6399999999999s)]
*  He accomplished much more than we realized. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1392.3200000000002s)]
*  And you've talked about some of it. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1394.96s)]
*  Some of it was that he brought human rights into the forefront of our foreign [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1397.44s)]
*  policy. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1403.48s)]
*  He accomplished many acts that got passed on energy. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1404.76s)]
*  He did the Camp David Accords and he stood for bipartisanship in a time. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1410.8000000000002s)]
*  In a time we need to remember the spirit that he brought to the presidency. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1418.88s)]
*  I think if he could only be alive to hear all these tributes, he'd finally have that [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1425.0s)]
*  smile on his big smile on his face, because I think he he was very proud of what he did. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1430.6000000000001s)]
*  I know he was. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1436.2800000000002s)]
*  He talked to me about that. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1437.2s)]
*  I interviewed him when he was 85. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1440.0400000000002s)]
*  And I think he everybody thought, well, that's the end. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1442.5200000000002s)]
*  You know, he's 85. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1445.8000000000002s)]
*  And so we talked about what he had accomplished. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1447.8s)]
*  He went on for another 15 years and accomplished even more. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1451.96s)]
*  We are watching Leslie Tu inside the Washington National Cathedral, a collection of some very [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1456.4399999999998s)]
*  special guests, Al Gore, along with Mike Pence and Dan Quayle, all talking to one another and saying [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1462.6s)]
*  hello. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1471.48s)]
*  And we previously witnessed a number of senators, the former presidents, have not yet arrived. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1471.96s)]
*  They will be likely the last to arrive in part because of security reasons. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1477.64s)]
*  But it is quite a collection of cabinet officials, lawmakers, former vice presidents, people who [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1481.48s)]
*  wanted to be president all there as well today. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1490.8400000000001s)]
*  And we just should note to the motorcade just passed by the White House. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1494.8400000000001s)]
*  They're making these stops all by these incredible moments for the former president, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1499.56s)]
*  because as we mentioned, this is the final farewell for Jimmy Carter. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1503.08s)]
*  Leslie, I do want to ask you about your incredible interview that you had with [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1507.48s)]
*  Carter and former President Ford. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1511.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, here Carter defeats Ford and then they become this presidential odd couple. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1514.52s)]
*  What did you make of their relationship? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1521.3999999999999s)]
*  What did they tell you? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1522.76s)]
*  It was stunning to realize. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1524.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't it wasn't very public. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1527.08s)]
*  So when we discovered it, there was great surprise because they had had a contentious [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1530.4399999999998s)]
*  battle. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1536.04s)]
*  They ran against each other and then they became serious pals. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1536.52s)]
*  They conferred with each other. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1542.76s)]
*  They complemented each other. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1544.28s)]
*  You know, these people who've been president, they have no one to talk to who understands [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1547.32s)]
*  what they'd gone through with all the pressure of that position. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1553.32s)]
*  And those two men, one, you know, obviously a Democrat, the other a Republican, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1558.12s)]
*  to become real friends who appreciated each other, complimented each other. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1565.3999999999999s)]
*  What a symbol. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1572.9199999999998s)]
*  What a wonderful example to set for the country, especially now, especially right at this moment [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1575.48s)]
*  in our history, when we need these examples of comedy between people who disagree on [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1582.92s)]
*  fundamentals to appreciate each other, talk to each other, compliment each other. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1589.64s)]
*  That's the spirit of this funeral right now to me anyway. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1598.28s)]
*  When I hear Republicans at the funeral stand up and praise this man, I found that just [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1603.3200000000002s)]
*  uplifting. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1611.8s)]
*  And Leslie, thank you. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1614.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1615.48s)]
*  And one of the eulogies today is by former president Ford and it will be read by his son today. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1615.8s)]
*  Also a eulogy left behind by Vice President Mondale, also read by his son. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1623.4s)]
*  Let's turn now to our chief election campaign correspondent, Robert Costa. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1630.1200000000001s)]
*  And Robert, just as we look at this incredible collection of dignitaries here who are here to [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1633.96s)]
*  remember Jimmy Carter. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1639.4s)]
*  It's such a gathering at the National Cathedral. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1640.92s)]
*  We saw the country music superstar Garth Brooks music embedded in the story of President Jimmy [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1643.72s)]
*  Carter going back to his presidential campaign, his boyhood to see the former vice presidents [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1650.0400000000002s)]
*  congregating there. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1655.5600000000002s)]
*  And you also see some of the new faces of Washington today. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1656.6000000000001s)]
*  The newly elected Pennsylvania Senator David McCormick talking with the vice president-elect [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1659.64s)]
*  J.D. Vance of Ohio, Supreme Court justices in a deeply divided town where partisanship often [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1665.4s)]
*  is the story. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1673.5600000000002s)]
*  Today, the story is the American presidency and American democracy. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1674.76s)]
*  And of course, the legacy and life of President Jimmy Carter, a truly American moment in a [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1679.4s)]
*  town where politics dominates today. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1685.88s)]
*  The national spirit is front and center. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1688.2s)]
*  And there you see Hunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden, just recently became [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1690.76s)]
*  a grandfather. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1695.88s)]
*  His daughter had a son the other day in California. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1697.24s)]
*  President Biden was out in California for that. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1700.3600000000001s)]
*  There you see Vice President Quayle, Vice President Quayle's wife, Marilyn Al Gore, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1702.3600000000001s)]
*  Vice President Pence, Karen Pence, a row of vice presidents. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1707.88s)]
*  AMNA NAWAZ, National Public Radio, The Washington Post, The Washington Post. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1712.2s)]
*  President Biden has declared today a national day of mourning. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1713.0800000000002s)]
*  So, all executive departments and agencies of the federal government are closed, except [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1716.68s)]
*  those that are necessary for the functioning. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1720.52s)]
*  And the idea, of course, is that everyone will take a moment to remember the legacy [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1723.0800000000002s)]
*  and service of Jimmy Carter. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1726.76s)]
*  Want to bring in presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, the author of The Unfinished Presidency, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1728.68s)]
*  Jimmy Carter's Legacy Beyond the White House. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1733.64s)]
*  And, Douglas, you knew the president and Rosalynn so well, their family. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1736.2s)]
*  What do you make of the service we will see today? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1741.24s)]
*  Well, Leslie Stahl used the phrase serious pals. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1743.56s)]
*  And the vice president that was a serious pal was Al Gore. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1747.32s)]
*  I have asked President Carter on two different occasions a decade apart who in American political [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1751.96s)]
*  life he admires. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1757.8s)]
*  And Al Gore would always come to the very top of his list. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1759.24s)]
*  Part of it was because of the Georgia-Tennessee connection, Southern feel. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1762.84s)]
*  But they just got along. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1769.3200000000002s)]
*  He did not have that kind of relationship with Jimmy Carter. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1771.5600000000002s)]
*  And they both won Nobel prizes. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1775.64s)]
*  I mean, Carter has been remembered by the world by winning a Nobel Peace Prize, and [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1778.2s)]
*  so has Al Gore. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1782.6000000000001s)]
*  So, they're in that kind of exclusive club. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1783.96s)]
*  Gerald Ford was another serious pal. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1787.5600000000002s)]
*  I mean, one could look at Leslie Stahl's piece with CBS Sunday Morning and say, oh, they [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1790.8400000000001s)]
*  were just making nice. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1795.96s)]
*  No, they really loved each other. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1797.72s)]
*  They would vacation together, travel together, talk to each other all the time. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1800.28s)]
*  And if you really go through the papers of post-1970, you know, 1980, 81, you know, and [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1805.16s)]
*  start looking, you'll see this development of their friendship through correspondence. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1812.84s)]
*  They did shared commissions. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1817.08s)]
*  They held democracy forums. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1818.76s)]
*  They were united in program after program after program. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1820.52s)]
*  And I asked President Carter once about that, and I compared it to how Jefferson, Thomas [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1824.12s)]
*  Jefferson and John Adams kind of were pitted against each other. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1830.52s)]
*  But at the end of their lives, they wrote each other with the correspondence. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1834.44s)]
*  He said, well, we don't write like Jefferson and Adams do, but we're doing what we can [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1837.96s)]
*  to help people in need and show the bipartisan spirit of America. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1843.72s)]
*  And last thing, it is a day of national mourning. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1849.3999999999999s)]
*  And I'm positive that Jimmy Carter is alive today. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1851.96s)]
*  He'll be thinking, how can we end up helping the people of the Palisades fire going on? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1854.6000000000001s)]
*  And he would not be blind to the suffering that's going on out there. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1859.88s)]
*  And we'd be thinking of how to rebuild or how to help people in need through this [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1863.08s)]
*  extraordinarily grim crisis that's ongoing. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1868.8400000000001s)]
*  Thank you for mentioning what's going on, of course, in L.A. County. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1872.44s)]
*  I want to bring in Margaret Brennan, moderator of Face the Nation. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1876.68s)]
*  And even as we discuss that relationship, President Jimmy Carter did have a complicated [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1879.24s)]
*  relationship with some other presidents, including Democratic presidents. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1883.64s)]
*  Oh, he did. He was also put to use by some of those presidents where he had some frustrated [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1887.08s)]
*  relations at time, Bill Clinton being one of them. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1893.08s)]
*  At times they butted heads, but Clinton actually used his diplomatic skills to [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1895.56s)]
*  send him on a number of missions to North Korea, to other framings, because he was [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1899.64s)]
*  willing to think out of the box. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1905.24s)]
*  I think of that biblical phrase, blessed be the peacemakers. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1907.08s)]
*  Carter built a lot of his diplomatic thinking around his Baptist faith, certainly. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1911.0s)]
*  But, you know, as Bob was talking about the age of some of those in the room, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1917.6399999999999s)]
*  one of Jimmy Carter's mid-east advisors was one of my college professors and spent a lot of time [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1922.28s)]
*  teaching us about what happened in Camp David Accords and the thinking outside the box of [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1927.8799999999999s)]
*  getting people who ultimately might have some self-interest in getting to a conclusion that's [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1933.64s)]
*  politically uncomfortable. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1938.1200000000001s)]
*  And he brought that through, obviously, in a way that will outlast him and his life that [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1939.72s)]
*  continues to impact and shape the modern Middle East we live in today in the diplomatic [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1945.48s)]
*  achievements that came since that time and what Donald Trump himself believes in this presidency [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1950.76s)]
*  will potentially be his crown achievement in building on the Abraham Accords and building [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1955.96s)]
*  further peace. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1960.6000000000001s)]
*  So Jimmy Carter, you know, we talk about the complicated politics, as Leslie Stahl pointed [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1961.72s)]
*  out, the awkward moments, the Iran crisis, for example. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1966.1200000000001s)]
*  But he did put in a lot of building blocks on the diplomatic front and was willing to take a lot of [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1970.84s)]
*  that diplomatic risk. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1976.2s)]
*  And I think that's something that as you look at those in the room, former Secretary of State [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1977.4s)]
*  John Kerry, others, that's what they recall, the willingness to seek peace through diplomacy. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1981.88s)]
*  Leslie Stahl, so much too of what you have pointed out is that there is this view of a failed Carter [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1989.0800000000002s)]
*  presidency, and yet so much was accomplished. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1995.0800000000002s)]
*  So much was accomplished. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1998.28s)]
*  But for one sec, Nora, I'd love to play off something that Doug said, which was that Jimmy [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=1999.48s)]
*  Carter won the Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2006.44s)]
*  I asked him when he was 85 years old what he was most proud of when he was president. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2008.6000000000001s)]
*  And I'm going to read you what he said. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2015.0800000000002s)]
*  He said, I'm most proud that every one of those 52 hostages that were taken by Iran [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2017.72s)]
*  came home alive. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2023.88s)]
*  I'm proud that we went through four years, his presidency, without ever firing a bullet, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2025.96s)]
*  never dropped a bomb, never launched a missile. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2032.28s)]
*  And he said, presidents' images are enhanced by going to war. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2035.4s)]
*  He said, I didn't go to war. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2039.88s)]
*  And that may have been one of the reasons that people didn't celebrate me as much, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2041.6399999999999s)]
*  but it's what I'm most proud of. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2047.56s)]
*  He deserved that Peace Prize for many reasons, but this is what he thought himself was the [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2050.44s)]
*  most important achievement of his four years. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2055.96s)]
*  And there were many in addition to foreign policy achievements, domestic achievements as well, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2060.68s)]
*  Douglas. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2065.48s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2066.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, we look back now and for one thing in the realm of conservation, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2067.0s)]
*  he doubled the size of the National Park Service, saved 56 million acres of wilderness in Alaska, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2070.92s)]
*  but also did things like, you know, created superfund sites, places that were toxic with [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2078.12s)]
*  debris. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2085.32s)]
*  You had to declare them that under Carter. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2085.7200000000003s)]
*  And so we knew where if you were living in a sustainable place, a lot of what today we [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2088.2000000000003s)]
*  call environmental justice issues of how poor communities are taking the brunt of industrial [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2092.52s)]
*  waste. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2098.76s)]
*  Carter was the one on top of that, but he also created a Department of Energy. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2099.56s)]
*  He created our Department of Education. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2103.7999999999997s)]
*  FEMA was Jimmy Carter on the domestic front, and he brought in so many judges during his... [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2108.52s)]
*  He didn't get it once to the Supreme Court, but for a one-term president, Carter got more [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2116.52s)]
*  federal judges through the system, including Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who eventually [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2122.2799999999997s)]
*  got to the Supreme Court during the Carter years. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2128.04s)]
*  He doesn't get enough credit for that. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2130.28s)]
*  And also, I spoke to Ralph Nader yesterday, and Nader told me it was the last time that [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2133.2400000000002s)]
*  there was consumer protection. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2138.76s)]
*  Carter came in and started talking to consumer activists and said, let's have a... [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2140.36s)]
*  It was still in the air then that we could... [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2144.84s)]
*  The consumers had these sort of rights, and Carter was the last president to do that. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2147.4s)]
*  And civil rights, Jimmy Carter was all about, and the appointment of women and Blacks into [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2152.44s)]
*  the administration was heroic, and it predated Bill Clinton and predated Barack Obama. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2158.6800000000003s)]
*  We see now the presidential motorcade approaching the Washington National Cathedral, which is [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2165.2400000000002s)]
*  packed with thousands of Washington dignitaries. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2171.4s)]
*  Short moment ago, we saw just in the front row there at least four of the Supreme Court [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2177.08s)]
*  justices, Amy Coney Barrett, Justice Kagan, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Alito. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2182.84s)]
*  There may have been more. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2189.16s)]
*  Those were just the ones that I spotted there. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2190.44s)]
*  This is called Hearst Circle, where they are bringing the hearse in now. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2192.68s)]
*  Hearst Circle, but they're bringing the hearse up there, up to the front steps of [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2198.04s)]
*  Washington National Cathedral, and Nancy Cordes is there, and I know she's smiling [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2203.32s)]
*  because we know her circle well. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2209.48s)]
*  That's our neighborhood. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2211.56s)]
*  And Nancy, describe what you're seeing. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2212.92s)]
*  Noura, the hearse has just pulled up directly behind us at the steps of the Washington [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2217.32s)]
*  National Cathedral. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2221.88s)]
*  The military honor guard is already in place to receive the hearse and carry it into the [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2223.32s)]
*  cathedral. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2231.0s)]
*  But first, members of President Carter's immediate family who have been traveling in [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2231.64s)]
*  the funeral procession will depart their cars. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2237.48s)]
*  They will walk in. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2241.4s)]
*  And this is a man who had 11 grandchildren, 14 great grandchildren, and many of them will [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2243.08s)]
*  be serving as honorary pallbearers today, walking alongside the casket of their grandfather [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2249.72s)]
*  and great grandfather as it is carried into the church. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2257.8s)]
*  One of the nice things about living to be 100 years old is that you have some time to [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2262.84s)]
*  think about how you'd like to be remembered, how you'd like to be honored. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2267.32s)]
*  And Carter played a role in a lot of what we will see today. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2272.2000000000003s)]
*  For example, Trisha Yearwood and Garth Brooks, two names we know well, will be singing here [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2276.76s)]
*  in the National Cathedral today. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2283.0800000000004s)]
*  They worked with him on several Habitat for Humanity projects. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2284.84s)]
*  And they'll be singing one of his favorite songs, Imagine, by John Lennon, which he loved [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2289.6400000000003s)]
*  because it was a song about world peace. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2295.0s)]
*  He said that it had practically become a second national anthem in some countries that didn't [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2297.56s)]
*  always experience a lot of peace. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2303.32s)]
*  It's a great point, Nancy Cortez. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2304.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2308.2000000000003s)]
*  Robert Costas here with us. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2309.08s)]
*  As we watch this beautiful scene unfold at the National Cathedral, it's important [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2310.2000000000003s)]
*  to also remember that today will end in Plains, Georgia. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2314.84s)]
*  You had such a powerful conversation, Nora, with Tony Loudon, the pastor, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2318.84s)]
*  personal pastor for President Carter. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2323.32s)]
*  I went to visit the pastor at Maranatha Baptist Church, a simple place. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2325.88s)]
*  It feels like it's right out of the Carter presidency with its shaggy green carpet, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2330.92s)]
*  low-key, low-slung building. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2335.0s)]
*  But it was so powerful on Tuesday night when I went to the Capitol to see thousands [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2337.4s)]
*  late at night coming to pay their respects to President Carter. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2341.0s)]
*  And thousands over the years went to Maranatha Baptist to pay their respects at that small [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2344.2s)]
*  church to see him teach Sunday school. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2348.9199999999996s)]
*  So you see the grandeur of the presidency in this moment, but it ends with something [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2351.0s)]
*  so symbolic of President Carter's life, a simplicity of faith and service that will [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2355.3999999999996s)]
*  really be the finality of this important and moving day. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2360.6s)]
*  This is Jimmy Carter's extended family now entering the cathedral. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2364.9199999999996s)]
*  Douglas? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2368.6s)]
*  Well, and a couple of enterprising musical producers have taken Jimmy Carter's sermons [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2369.48s)]
*  from Maranatha Baptist in Plains and put them on a CD, and it got nominated for a Grammy. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2375.72s)]
*  So President Carter's up for a Grammy for spoken word against Cher and Barbara Streisand. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2381.48s)]
*  So it's a big, big competition. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2388.84s)]
*  And the family has been just every step of the way here, staying together as a group [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2394.2799999999997s)]
*  and doing everything you would expect of the children and the grandchildren to do. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2400.44s)]
*  And I think Amy Carter's crying this past week was one of the emotional moments that kind of [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2405.08s)]
*  choked people up. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2411.16s)]
*  Barry, I want to note that when President Carter left office in January 1981, the Carter [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2412.44s)]
*  spoke with Leslie Stahl about what it was like to return home to Plains, Georgia after [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2418.36s)]
*  losing the election. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2424.2000000000003s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2425.6400000000003s)]
*  Here's what you said, though, when President Clinton gave you the Medal of Freedom. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2428.1200000000003s)]
*  We left Washington in something of despair, embarrassment and frustration. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2433.8s)]
*  That's true. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2440.6000000000004s)]
*  We did. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2441.6400000000003s)]
*  And we came back to Plains with no idea at all of what we would do with the rest of our lives. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2442.14s)]
*  And I realized that I had a life expectancy of 25 years or so as a 56-year-old ex-president. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2450.8599999999997s)]
*  And we found to our amazement and despair that we were a million dollars in debt. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2460.8599999999997s)]
*  We had left a very thriving business when we went to the White House and it went downhill. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2467.74s)]
*  During those four years. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2472.14s)]
*  In a blind trust. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2473.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2475.02s)]
*  We thought we were going to lose our farms and our home and we didn't know what we were [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2475.8199999999997s)]
*  going to have to do to repay our debt. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2479.9s)]
*  So we kind of huddled down and came back to Plains where we felt we belonged. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2482.94s)]
*  But it does suggest that there was despair, even though you don't write about it. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2488.2999999999997s)]
*  There was despair. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2495.18s)]
*  Despair, discouragement, uncertainty about the future. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2496.22s)]
*  But it didn't take us long to start planning what we were going to do. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2499.7400000000002s)]
*  And many people don't know that part of what part of from Leslie's interview too about what a [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2506.94s)]
*  difficult return to Plains it was, Bob. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2511.26s)]
*  Well, he had put his all of his holdings in a blind trust. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2513.42s)]
*  And only when he left the White House did he discover he was not just flat broke. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2518.1400000000003s)]
*  He owed a million dollars. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2523.5s)]
*  And people say, you know, he why did he write so many books? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2525.98s)]
*  He started writing the books because he had to make a living. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2530.62s)]
*  And he wound up writing 35 and we're all better for for knowing that. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2534.14s)]
*  But that was the beginning of his literary career. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2539.5s)]
*  And Leslie Stahl is with us and Leslie was revealing [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2543.26s)]
*  how difficult that post presidency period was in the beginning that he turned around. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2548.54s)]
*  He turned it around. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2552.7s)]
*  And the most important part was not the financial part. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2553.82s)]
*  It was what he decided to do with his life, which we all know about. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2557.26s)]
*  People talk so much about the post presidency where he he was. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2561.5s)]
*  He was, I want to say, curing diseases in Africa, building homes for poor people. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2568.14s)]
*  His post presidency was just a remarkable example for presidents. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2575.5s)]
*  And for all of us, what a way to spend your last years. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2582.14s)]
*  He only thought he had 25 years left. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2587.42s)]
*  That's part of that interview that I found amusing. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2589.9s)]
*  You know, looking back on it, he said, I only have 25 years to go. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2593.02s)]
*  He he obviously decided not just to revive his family financially, but [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2598.06s)]
*  to make it meaningful, to give it a real purpose, a serious purpose. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2607.1s)]
*  You know, I guess was reminded of something he taught Sunday school the whole time he was president. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2612.46s)]
*  He would go back to Georgia and one day and go back to Plains. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2619.1s)]
*  One day I was in the pool in Sunday school and he gave his sermon and he looked up right at me. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2623.9s)]
*  I'll never forget this. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2631.98s)]
*  Obviously, he looked right up at me and he pointed and he said, I hope you got something out of this. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2633.1s)]
*  You know, presidents, none of them like the press. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2638.86s)]
*  I just want to impress upon everybody. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2646.7s)]
*  None of them. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2649.02s)]
*  Well, you certainly remember that and we can all remember those admonitions from presidents [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2651.34s)]
*  that we cover. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2657.74s)]
*  I just want to take a moment to just listen in to what's happening [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2659.18s)]
*  at the magnificent Washington National Cathedral here in Washington. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2663.1800000000003s)]
*  As Nancy Cordes reminded us is the second largest in the Americas and the sixth largest in the world. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2668.1400000000003s)]
*  And Robert Costa is with us and we're just waiting for direction about when the next part of this [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2692.3s)]
*  procession begins where they will bring the casket inside the Washington National [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2716.7s)]
*  Cathedral for the services that begin in just about 10 to 15 minutes from now. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2721.8199999999997s)]
*  And it's a moment for the American presidency. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2726.14s)]
*  President Joe Biden in his final days in his term will deliver a eulogy today. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2729.02s)]
*  Something sources close to him have told me he's thought a lot about. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2735.5s)]
*  He was the first U.S. senator to endorse Jimmy Carter, then Governor Carter when [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2738.7s)]
*  Carter was running for president in 1976. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2743.74s)]
*  And when you think about President Biden's career and President Carter, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2746.9399999999996s)]
*  they were both forged in that early period of the 1970s. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2749.9799999999996s)]
*  Carter goes to the convention in 1972 in Miami and says, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2753.74s)]
*  maybe presidential politics is something I could do. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2757.8999999999996s)]
*  Joe Biden, of course, elected to the Senate in 1972, during tragedy that year as well. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2760.62s)]
*  And they've coursed through American life not always on the same path, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2766.9399999999996s)]
*  but aligned relatively speaking for a long time. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2771.26s)]
*  And President-elect Trump will be here today. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2774.5400000000004s)]
*  And it's notable that President-elect Trump last night went to the U.S. Capitol [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2777.34s)]
*  and paid his respects to President Carter alongside first lady, former first lady, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2782.0600000000004s)]
*  and incoming first lady, Melania Trump. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2788.1400000000003s)]
*  And Trump said to reporters that he's always had a strong relationship with Carter, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2791.1000000000004s)]
*  not a close relationship per se, but a respectful one. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2796.0600000000004s)]
*  And a former Carter adviser, Jerry Raffichoun, told me about a 2019 phone call [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2799.74s)]
*  they had, Trump and Carter, where they joked about how they both [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2804.3799999999997s)]
*  did not particularly like John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2807.9799999999996s)]
*  And it speaks to Trump's playfulness with some of the former presidents. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2812.3799999999997s)]
*  Trump and Carter both have their own irregularities, shall we say, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2815.58s)]
*  when it comes to that so-called president's club in American political life. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2819.66s)]
*  But they themselves always had a relatively friendly relationship. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2823.66s)]
*  President Trump will be there today. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2828.2999999999997s)]
*  It is called the world's most exclusive fraternity, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2829.74s)]
*  and five of those so-called presidents and former presidents will be there. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2832.9399999999996s)]
*  Nancy Cordes is outside the cathedral. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2838.62s)]
*  Nancy? [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2840.62s)]
*  Nora, I was just thinking, as Robert was talking about Donald Trump and his [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2843.98s)]
*  relationship with Jimmy Carter, that that's notable. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2848.4599999999996s)]
*  Trump is not always a welcome presence at some of these events. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2854.7s)]
*  I'm thinking in particular of the late Senator John McCain's funeral [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2859.74s)]
*  that was also held here at the Washington National Cathedral, [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2865.1s)]
*  where it was made known that McCain did not want Trump to be here. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2868.62s)]
*  They had a famously fractious relationship. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2875.3399999999997s)]
*  But the Carters, on the other hand, made it very clear when Rosalind Carter [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2878.4599999999996s)]
*  passed away a little over a year ago that they very much hoped that Melania Trump would be [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2883.02s)]
*  among the other first ladies, current and former, who attended her service. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2890.46s)]
*  So a family that always looked for inclusivity. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2896.86s)]
*  I think it's also notable, as we've heard Douglas and Leslie talking so eloquently [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2902.14s)]
*  about Carter's relationship with, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2909.34s)]
*  lifelong relationship with his Vice President Walter Mondale. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2912.46s)]
*  That's something that shouldn't be taken for granted either. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2916.78s)]
*  There are several presidents in that cathedral right now who famously did not, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2919.6600000000003s)]
*  and do not have great relationships with their former vice presidents. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2925.26s)]
*  President Clinton and Vice President Gore, we're told are not particularly close. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2930.78s)]
*  We believe that President-elect Trump and his former Vice President Mike Pence [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2936.22s)]
*  actually haven't even been in the same room since they left office in 2021. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2942.54s)]
*  And so they're coming face to face for the first time in four years. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2948.62s)]
*  They're in the cathedral today. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2952.94s)]
*  Randy Hollerith, who as you know, Nora, is the Dean of the Washington National Cathedral, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2956.14s)]
*  spoke to reporters yesterday. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2960.22s)]
*  He said that he had the opportunity to meet late President Carter when he was a teenager. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2961.74s)]
*  He said that Carter was famously punctual, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2967.9799999999996s)]
*  which is something that can't be said about all presidents. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2971.4199999999996s)]
*  And so they are going to try to honor his punctuality today [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2973.66s)]
*  by keeping the service to time, which they say is something that Carter would have wanted. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2978.8599999999997s)]
*  So we anticipate that if everything goes as planned, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2984.2999999999997s)]
*  the service will last about an hour and 15 minutes to an hour and a half. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2987.74s)]
*  Thank you. Yes. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2993.18s)]
*  The Dean of the Cathedral, Randy Hollerith, Reverend Hollerith, saying [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2995.4199999999996s)]
*  you're really watching history unfold when you come to these funerals. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=2999.1s)]
*  And it's not only an opportunity for people to remember a president, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3002.62s)]
*  but also to watch the people who are honoring him that have gathered here for that very moment. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3006.7799999999997s)]
*  Douglas, you knew the former president so well, and people like to hear these anecdotal stories. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3014.3799999999997s)]
*  I can remember when I interviewed him, he was 96 years old, and we knew he was punctual. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3018.8599999999997s)]
*  We were ready to go. And at the last moment, there was a little bit of a mechanical problem. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3023.74s)]
*  He did become a bit impatient, even though we were talking about the topic of faith, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3029.2599999999998s)]
*  even in his late years, that discipline, that punctuality never ceased to leave him. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3033.74s)]
*  You knew that about the punctuality, but by human nature, you might be a minute late. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3041.02s)]
*  And he was very down home in one way, but also an intimidating seniority. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3045.74s)]
*  If you walked in and you were a moment late, then you would get the glare. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3051.18s)]
*  Was this the nuclear submariner in him? [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3054.54s)]
*  It was the military in him. And since he joined the Naval Academy in 1943 and then continued [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3057.1s)]
*  with the naval career, there's no room for a second wrong when you're on a nuclear submarine [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3065.26s)]
*  on a Pacific fleet in typhoon weather. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3071.26s)]
*  We're watching now some of the former presidents enter, including President-elect Donald Trump. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3075.26s)]
*  There's members of the Carter family as well, and President-elect and former First Lady Melania [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3082.7000000000003s)]
*  Trump have entered. And this is probably the beginning of some of the presidents. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3091.5s)]
*  You see Al Gore shaking his hand. Wow. And Mike Pence. That is probably the first time the two men [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3096.86s)]
*  have shaken hands since January 6th. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3105.42s)]
*  Well, I think Leslie said, I don't think they've been in the same room together. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3107.98s)]
*  I mean, Robert, you've done so much reporting about that relationship, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3113.42s)]
*  not to diverge from the story of the day, but. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3116.54s)]
*  But they did just shake hands. And for President-elect Trump and for former Vice President Pence, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3119.18s)]
*  a moment where they could come together as two people who serve this country, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3125.02s)]
*  there's former President Barack Obama. They did not have a long exchange, clearly, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3128.62s)]
*  Trump and Pence. But there was a thaw in there and that exchange and that handshake, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3133.66s)]
*  who knows where it leads or what it means for them to decide and for us to cover in the weeks ahead. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3138.94s)]
*  But there was a handshake and well, we all remember what happened in January of 2021, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3144.86s)]
*  but this is January of 2025. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3150.54s)]
*  And Bob, interesting to see Al Gore, former Vice President, right next to Mike Pence, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3152.46s)]
*  two vice presidents who found some common ground despite party difference, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3156.86s)]
*  having both presided over the certification of elections they lost. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3161.58s)]
*  Mike Pence recently being quoted as talking about a conversation from Al Gore where Al Gore said, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3167.1800000000003s)]
*  I really respect you and Pence saying I drew on your example in 2020. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3172.46s)]
*  And this an extraordinary moment as the president-elect sitting next to Barack Obama. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3179.42s)]
*  And you think about in 2016 during the transition, these two men, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3185.98s)]
*  Barack Obama, Donald Trump, two presidents had a bit of a chilly exchange. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3190.54s)]
*  Everyone was bewildered in the Democratic Party by Trump's election. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3196.14s)]
*  There's former President George W. Bush. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3199.18s)]
*  Who did not shake Trump's hand. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3202.06s)]
*  And the first lady, former first lady Laura Bush. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3205.98s)]
*  But this is the way it's supposed to be. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3211.8199999999997s)]
*  This is the way America operates. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3215.5s)]
*  One president's elected and then another, and they go on and move forward. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3220.94s)]
*  I remember Melania Trump went to the Rosalind Carter's funeral. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3226.38s)]
*  She represented the Trumps there. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3232.78s)]
*  And as was said, while Jimmy Carter politically didn't care for Donald Trump, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3235.6600000000003s)]
*  they did have a little bit of a personal relationship of talking about issues of the [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3242.46s)]
*  world from time to time and once President Trump visited with Carter in New York. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3247.5s)]
*  And look how appropriately former President George W. Bush stands to welcome the [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3253.34s)]
*  former first lady Hillary Clinton and President Clinton. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3258.06s)]
*  We have not seen President Bush interact with President Trump. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3263.42s)]
*  We have not. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3267.7400000000002s)]
*  And we can see other members of the presidential family. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3269.26s)]
*  I see Chelsea Clinton sitting next to some of the Biden family back there. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3272.2200000000003s)]
*  Some of those faces you may not recognize are Secret Service agents [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3277.42s)]
*  that are sitting very close because this is a national security event. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3281.18s)]
*  The one behind President-elect Trump was famously behind President-elect Trump [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3285.5s)]
*  during the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3291.02s)]
*  I do want to mention, Margaret, too, we're looking at our former president's United States, [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3294.86s)]
*  but there are world dignitaries here as well. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3299.02s)]
*  Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Edward sitting next to Justin Trudeau. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3301.26s)]
*  So there are world dignitaries here to pay their tribute as well. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3304.7s)]
*  That's right, the recently resigned Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau is there. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3308.78s)]
*  Right behind him I saw earlier the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3314.0600000000004s)]
*  Gordon Brown, as well. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3317.6600000000003s)]
*  There are ambassadors representing their countries [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3319.1800000000003s)]
*  encircling that entire area. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3322.7000000000003s)]
*  I think I saw the Korean ambassador, the Monogasc ambassador. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3324.5400000000004s)]
*  So it is really paying tribute to the United States, to the passing of a commander in chief. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3329.1000000000004s)]
*  Countries that may not have been in the forefront of a diplomatic breakthrough. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3335.82s)]
*  I haven't yet seen Middle East ambassadors there. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3340.94s)]
*  I've seen mainly European and Asian, but his legacy was pretty significant. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3343.34s)]
*  We talked a bit about the Middle East, but also in Asia. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3350.2200000000003s)]
*  He built upon what Richard Nixon had done with that breakthrough with China [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3353.02s)]
*  and helped to normalize diplomatic relations with the People's Republic [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3357.1800000000003s)]
*  after 30-odd years of refusal. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3361.58s)]
*  Perhaps to note too, he did press hard on the issue of Palestinian statehood. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3364.6200000000003s)]
*  He did indeed. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3371.6600000000003s)]
*  He did. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3372.46s)]
*  And it was, you know, I was rereading this book, Peace Process, that his Middle East advisor wrote, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3372.94s)]
*  and the recounting of being in the room and pressing Menachem Begin to make some really [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3379.5800000000004s)]
*  hard calls here. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3385.42s)]
*  He said, I'll go public and say the Israelis wouldn't agree to this. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3388.6200000000003s)]
*  And if you don't agree, we'll end here. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3391.5s)]
*  We've heard so many times a story about him calling on the soul morality and responsibility [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3394.78s)]
*  to the future generations, presenting those photos of the grandchildren. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3401.66s)]
*  But there were some hard moments too. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3404.94s)]
*  There were some very hard diplomatic moments. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3407.02s)]
*  Carter was often criticized for micromanaging. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3409.74s)]
*  They said even if you wanted to play on the White House tennis court, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3413.74s)]
*  you had to go through Carter. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3416.86s)]
*  He approved everybody who went there. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3418.7s)]
*  But when you go to the Camp David Accords and those meetings up there at Camp David, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3421.5s)]
*  that was micromanaging when it really worked, because it wouldn't have happened had it not been [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3425.82s)]
*  his micromanaging. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3432.46s)]
*  It was interesting to hear Nora talk about the precision he had on timing because it was the [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3433.66s)]
*  constructive ambiguity that was the phrase they used that made the diplomacy possible, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3438.78s)]
*  not actually getting into hammering out. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3443.5s)]
*  You can't help but witness this incredible collection of vice presidents. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3445.26s)]
*  Presidents want to be presidents in this first year on their personal relations. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3450.54s)]
*  This is a snapshot of the complexity of American politics and especially the American presidency. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3453.82s)]
*  You see President Barack Obama huddling right there with President-elect Trump. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3459.74s)]
*  I've spoken to President-elect Trump many times over the years about President Obama. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3463.98s)]
*  And let's remember, it was Trump who questioned Obama's love of country and credentials with [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3468.38s)]
*  the birther crusade years ago. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3473.42s)]
*  But also Trump has told me over the years he respected politically [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3475.5s)]
*  how President Obama was able to win the presidency as a movement candidate, an outsider [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3479.34s)]
*  candidate in 2008. And some Trump advisors have said that model set forward by David Plouffe [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3484.46s)]
*  and Barack Obama inspired to appoint the Trump campaign of 2016 Vice President Kamala Harris, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3491.02s)]
*  President Bill Clinton. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3498.94s)]
*  I know Leslie Stahl is with us, Leslie. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3500.38s)]
*  Nora, I'm watching the ceremony here. Someone before said that President Carter had written [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3504.1400000000003s)]
*  down, expressed what he wanted in these ceremonies. I'm a little amused because when he was president, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3513.02s)]
*  he didn't want to have these ceremonies. He, what we call, depomped the office. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3523.58s)]
*  He didn't want hail to the chief played by the trumpeters every time he walked in the room. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3530.3s)]
*  He got rid of that. And he realized that that was a mistake. The public wanted to see that, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3535.7400000000002s)]
*  the trappings of the presidency. And so he had to put that back in to the regular course of [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3543.26s)]
*  his day when he was president. And he's come around to realize it, obviously, in the way this is a [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3553.26s)]
*  traditional process and ceremony so that we can see the transition that takes place in our country [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3559.82s)]
*  from president to president to president and the importance of bringing all these people together. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3571.6600000000003s)]
*  I was struck by the fact, I think Douglas said that President Carter wanted the Trumps to be there. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3577.9s)]
*  He wanted all the past presidents to come together and honor him, celebrate. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3587.8199999999997s)]
*  He did so many things, as I said, to depomp the presidency. It was kind of amusing at the time. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3595.98s)]
*  He used to carry his own suitcases on to Air Force One and people kept saying to him, don't do that. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3602.22s)]
*  Presidents don't do that. But that was his spirit. It was his spirit. They will play hail to the chief [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3608.2999999999997s)]
*  again today. And there we see President of the United States, Joe Biden, and the First Lady, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3616.14s)]
*  Joe Biden, the last to enter in these final moments before the service is about to begin. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3621.74s)]
*  I want to speak with Robert Costa and Douglas Brinkley. And what you see here in this scene is [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3627.74s)]
*  everybody, in a sense, showing up. And that was important to President Carter. I ran into President [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3632.46s)]
*  Carter and Mrs. Carter in January of 2017 at the U.S. Capitol. They showed up for President [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3639.2599999999998s)]
*  Trump's inauguration that day and they had a quiet presence, observed it, paid their respects [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3645.58s)]
*  to the moment then. And Carter would often go to the Oval Office to meet with former presidents at [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3650.86s)]
*  certain gatherings. And so you see here, not everyone there loves each other or even likes [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3657.5s)]
*  each other, but they respect President Carter and they respect the country. And we remember when [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3663.42s)]
*  Jimmy Carter became president in 1977, we had been a divided country. The Vietnam War cut us in half, [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3669.02s)]
*  Doves versus Hawks, young people versus old people, era of civil rights, Vietnam. And [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3676.7000000000003s)]
*  Gerald Ford had called his memoir, A Time to Heal, his presidential memoir, Jimmy Carter's [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3685.34s)]
*  Keeping Faith. What Carter and Ford wanted to do is get faith back in America's bipartisan tradition [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3691.5s)]
*  the whole better angels of our nature idea of Lincoln. And lo and behold, what we're witnessing [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3699.02s)]
*  right now is really extraordinary seeing Donald Trump meet with Mike Pence for the first time, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3705.66s)]
*  seeing Barack Obama talking with Donald Trump. Bill Clinton has been in George Washington Hospital [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3711.42s)]
*  sick with fever just a week ago and has worked to get healthy enough to come to make sure that he's [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3720.7000000000003s)]
*  there. So it really is in a way a moment. Bob, as you were saying of the past and that we need [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3727.66s)]
*  to continue, it's a tradition that we pull together when one of our commanders in chief passes. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3734.54s)]
*  And you can see members of the Carter family standing up to go and personally greet the [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3741.8999999999996s)]
*  president of the United States, Joe Biden, no doubt thanking him for everything that he has done in [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3747.66s)]
*  terms of the preparations for today, this national day of mourning today with all executive [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3754.62s)]
*  government offices closed, long-standing friendship there as this state funeral is set to begin on time [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3759.1s)]
*  as we see the Paul Bearers, the honorary Paul Bearers there. And there's such history in this [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3766.14s)]
*  scene. You see President Clinton, then Governor Carter went to Arkansas in 1974 to campaign for [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3770.38s)]
*  a young unknown House candidate named Billy Clinton. Let's listen in now to the beginning [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3777.58s)]
*  of this state funeral for the 39th president. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3784.06s)]
*  With faith in Jesus Christ, we receive the body of our brother James for burial. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=3994.06s)]
*  Let us pray with confidence to God, the giver of life, that he will raise him to perfection [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4004.86s)]
*  in the company of the saints. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4010.7799999999997s)]
*  Deliver your servant James, O sovereign Lord Christ, from all evil and set him free from [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4012.62s)]
*  every bond, that he may rest with all your saints in the eternal habitations, wherewith the Father [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4017.3399999999997s)]
*  and the Holy Spirit, you live and reign, one God, forever and ever. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4024.2999999999997s)]
*  Let us also pray for all who are in the body of our brother James. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4033.66s)]
*  Let us pray for all who mourn, that they may cast their care on God and know the consolation of his love. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4042.62s)]
*  Almighty God, look with pity on the sorrows of your servants for whom we pray. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4051.8199999999997s)]
*  Remember them, Lord, in mercy. Nourish them with patience. Comfort them with a sense of your goodness. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4058.7799999999997s)]
*  Lift up your countenance upon them and give them peace through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4067.34s)]
*  Ready, set, go. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4097.82s)]

*  For if we live, we live unto the Lord, and we die unto the Lord. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4894.34s)]
*  Whether we live, therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4902.34s)]
*  Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4911.34s)]
*  Even so, saith the Spirit, for they rest from their labors. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4917.34s)]
*  The Lord be with you. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4927.34s)]
*  And also with you. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4929.34s)]
*  Let us pray. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4931.34s)]
*  O God, whose mercies cannot be numbered, accept our prayers on behalf of your servant James, [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4936.34s)]
*  and grant him an entrance into the land of light and joy in the fellowship of your saints. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4943.34s)]
*  Through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4951.34s)]
*  one God now and forever. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4957.34s)]
*  Amen. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4960.34s)]
*  Amen. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=4990.34s)]
*  My grandfather started teaching Sunday school when he was a midshipman at the Naval Academy. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5021.34s)]
*  He taught the Bible every Sunday from World War II to COVID. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5028.34s)]
*  For all my grandfather's travels, he structured his life so that he was home in Plains to teach at Marananto on Sunday. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5032.34s)]
*  It was central to his life. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5039.34s)]
*  Every time I went to church with him, it was packed. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5042.34s)]
*  The line started before sunrise, and I was always very thankful that I got to walk in with my grandmother. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5045.34s)]
*  And as soon as we sat down, Sunday school would start. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5052.34s)]
*  My grandfather always began by asking if anybody had been in his church before. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5056.34s)]
*  My grandmother and I raised our hands on almost no one instead. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5061.34s)]
*  And then my grandfather would pull the congregation, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5066.34s)]
*  and we quickly find out that the church was full of people from all over the country, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5069.34s)]
*  of all different backgrounds and beliefs. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5074.34s)]
*  And my grandfather would address the most diverse Sunday school class ever assembled, again. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5077.34s)]
*  Before he delivered his Bible lesson, my grandfather talked about his week. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5084.34s)]
*  If he monitored an election, he'd talk about it. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5090.34s)]
*  If he stopped a conflict, he'd talk about it. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5094.34s)]
*  If he eliminated a disease from a village or a country, he would talk about it. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5098.34s)]
*  When my brother Jeremy died, he announced that news in Sunday school. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5106.34s)]
*  In fact, I remember that my brother died on a Sunday because it was the only time my grandfather was ever late to teach. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5112.34s)]
*  My grandfather won the Nobel Peace Prize. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5121.34s)]
*  The Sunday school class learned first. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5124.34s)]
*  At the end of his Nobel Peace Prize lecture, he stated the most serious and universal problem on our planet [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5128.34s)]
*  is the growing chasm between the richest and poorest people on earth. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5133.34s)]
*  For the next two decades, as the problem compounded, he returned to this theme with stories from the Bible and stories from today [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5138.34s)]
*  of the richest people in the world using their enormous wealth to buy a nation's poverty. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5148.34s)]
*  Many of the people that my grandparents helped lived on less than one dollar a day. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5155.34s)]
*  My grandfather spent the entire time I've known him helping those in need. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5161.34s)]
*  He built houses for people that needed homes. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5166.34s)]
*  He eliminated diseases in forgotten places. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5169.34s)]
*  He waged peace anywhere in the world. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5174.34s)]
*  Wherever he saw a chance, he loved people. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5177.34s)]
*  And whenever he told these stories in Sunday school, he always said he did it for one simple reason. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5183.34s)]
*  He worshipped the Prince of Peace, and he commanded it. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5190.34s)]
*  The bedrock of my grandfather's faith comes from the Apostle Paul's letter to the Romans, chapter 8, 1-18, 38 and 39. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5198.34s)]
*  Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5211.34s)]
*  because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5215.34s)]
*  For what the law was powerless to do and that it was weakened by the sinful nature, [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5225.34s)]
*  God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5230.34s)]
*  And so he condemned sin and sinful man in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us, [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5238.34s)]
*  who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5247.34s)]
*  Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5253.34s)]
*  But those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5260.34s)]
*  The mind of sinful man is death, but the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5267.34s)]
*  The sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5276.34s)]
*  Those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please God. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5283.34s)]
*  You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit, that the Spirit of God lives in you. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5288.34s)]
*  And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5295.34s)]
*  But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5301.34s)]
*  Yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5307.34s)]
*  And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5311.34s)]
*  he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit, who lives in you. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5315.34s)]
*  Therefore, brothers, we have an obligation. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5323.34s)]
*  But it is not to the sinful nature to live according to it. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5326.34s)]
*  For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5331.34s)]
*  But if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5336.34s)]
*  Because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5341.34s)]
*  For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave begin to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5347.34s)]
*  And by him we cry, Abba, Father. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5355.34s)]
*  The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5360.34s)]
*  Now if we are children, then we are heirs, heirs of God and coheirs with Christ, [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5365.34s)]
*  if indeed we share his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5372.34s)]
*  I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing to the glory that will be revealed in us. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5378.34s)]
*  For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5384.34s)]
*  neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5391.34s)]
*  will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5398.34s)]
*  The word of the Lord. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5405.34s)]
*  Amen. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5407.34s)]
*  Amen. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5437.34s)]
*  Amen. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5467.34s)]
*  Before I start, the Carter children, my wife and I were sitting several rows behind you. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5497.34s)]
*  We were praying for you and I was humbly reminded that it was 18 years ago, [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5521.34s)]
*  almost to the day that our family sat in that very row and supporting my mom, [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5531.34s)]
*  and it was your dad and his great faith that supported my mom and gave her hope that week. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5539.34s)]
*  He traveled with us for several days and we were blessed, so thank you. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5550.34s)]
*  God did a good thing when he made your dad. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5559.34s)]
*  Jack, Chip, Jeff, Amy, Mr. President, Madam Vice President, former presidents, first ladies, [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5567.34s)]
*  members of the House of Representatives and the Senate, justices of the Supreme Court, [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5578.34s)]
*  distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5586.34s)]
*  In the twilight of my dad's life, dad and President Carter spoke by phone [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5590.34s)]
*  and dad asked President Carter if he would do a eulogy at dad's funeral. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5599.34s)]
*  President Carter graciously agreed and then he also asked if dad would deliver a eulogy [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5606.34s)]
*  at President Carter's funeral. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5615.34s)]
*  Now, dad was thrilled to agree. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5619.34s)]
*  After that call, as you can imagine, both of them got off the phone and had a pretty good chuckle, [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5624.34s)]
*  considering which one of them would return in person to deliver that second eulogy. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5631.34s)]
*  As you know, dad died in 2006 and President Carter's eulogy continues to bring comfort, smile, laughter, [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5640.34s)]
*  joy, pride to our family. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5654.34s)]
*  And thus, on behalf of my dad, it's an honor to share dad's eulogy to his old friend. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5659.34s)]
*  I can just see my dad getting his yellow legal pad out with his pen and writing this for his beloved friend. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5670.34s)]
*  By fate of a brief season, Jimmy Carter and I were rivals. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5682.34s)]
*  But for the many wonderful years that followed, friendship bonded us as no two presidents since John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5688.34s)]
*  It is said that President Adams' last words were, Thomas Jefferson still survives. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5698.34s)]
*  Now, since Jimmy has a good decade on me, I'm hedging my bets by entrusting my remembrances of Jimmy to my son, Steve. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5706.34s)]
*  According to a map, it's a long way between Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Plains, Georgia. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5717.34s)]
*  But distances have a way of vanishing when measured in values rather than miles. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5728.34s)]
*  And it was because of our shared values that Jimmy and I respected each other as adversaries, even before we cherished one another as dear friends. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5741.34s)]
*  Now, this is not to say that Jimmy never got under my skin, but has there ever been a group of politicians that didn't do that to one another? [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5754.34s)]
*  During our 1976 contest, Jimmy knew my political vulnerabilities, and he successfully pointed them out. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5765.34s)]
*  I didn't like it, but little could I know that the outcome of that 1976 election would bring about one of my deepest and most enduring friendships. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5776.34s)]
*  In the summer of 1981, the two of us found ourselves together again, this time aboard Air Force One bound for the funeral of the great peacemaker Anwar Sadat. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5790.34s)]
*  There's an old line to the effect that two presidents in a room is one too many. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5805.34s)]
*  Frankly, I wondered how awkward that long flight might be to Cairo, and it was a long flight. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5818.34s)]
*  But the return trip was not nearly long enough, for it was somewhere over the Atlantic that Jimmy and I forged a friendship that transcends politics. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5825.34s)]
*  We immediately decided to exercise one of the privileges of a former president, forgetting that either one of us had ever said any harsh words about the other one in the heat of battle. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5842.34s)]
*  Then we got on to much more enjoyable subjects, discussing our families, our faith, and sharing our experiences in discovering that there is indeed life after the White House. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5855.34s)]
*  We commiserated over the high cost of building presidential libraries, and the even more regrettable fact that most of that fundraising for these otherwise admirable institutions fell to us personally. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5872.34s)]
*  On the spot, we agreed to participate in programs at each other's library, beginning with a series of conferences on arms control. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5892.34s)]
*  And if that wasn't newsworthy enough, we told reporters on the plane that a lasting Middle East peace would require the United States to make tough decisions, like confronting the Palestinian issue directly, thereby building on the work to which President Sadat had literally given his life. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5903.34s)]
*  It was the first time, but by no means the last time, that our unlikely partnership ruffled feathers in the Washington establishment. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5931.34s)]
*  Now, honesty and truth-telling were synonymous with the name Jimmy Carter. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5943.34s)]
*  Those traits were instilled in him by his loving parents, Lillian and Earl Carter, and the strength of his honesty was reinforced by his upbringing in the rural South, poised on the brink of social transformation. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5955.34s)]
*  He displayed that honesty throughout his life as a naval officer, state legislator, governor, president, and world leader. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5973.34s)]
*  For Jimmy Carter, honesty was not an aspirational goal. It was part of his very soul. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5983.34s)]
*  Now, I think Jimmy wrote more books than any former president. Once asked if he really enjoyed writing, he replied with that familiar twinkle in his eye at beets picking cotton. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=5991.34s)]
*  But I think he enjoyed writing for another reason. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6005.34s)]
*  As an author, he was under no pressure to tailor his opinions to some political constituency or potential contributor. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6011.34s)]
*  Now, both of us had experienced the harsh reality that defeat at the polls can be painful, but we also came to know a more important consequence. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6025.34s)]
*  Political defeat and writing can also be liberating if it frees you to discuss topics that aren't necessarily consistent with short-term political popularity. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6041.34s)]
*  Now, Jimmy learned early on that it was not enough merely to bear witness in a pew on a Sunday morning inspired by his faith. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6059.34s)]
*  He pursued brotherhood across boundaries of nationhood, across boundaries of tradition, across boundaries of caste. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6069.34s)]
*  In America's urban neighborhoods and in rural villages around the world, he reminded us that Christ had been a carpenter. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6080.34s)]
*  And in third-world villages, he successfully campaigned not for votes, but for the eradication of diseases that shame the developed world as they ravage the undeveloped one. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6090.34s)]
*  Now, of course, not all of Jimmy's time was spent building houses, eradicating disease, brokering ceasefires, monitoring elections. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6107.34s)]
*  While Jimmy is probably the only former president to conduct a weekly Bible class, I know for certain he is the only former president to perform a duet of On the Road Again with Willie Nelson. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6117.34s)]
*  Georgia wasn't just on Jimmy's mind. It was in his blood. However far he traveled, he never forgot where he came home to or where now in the end he would finally come home to. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6137.34s)]
*  Of the many things Jimmy and I had in common, the most important is this. We both married way above ourselves, way above. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6157.34s)]
*  With Jimmy, every step of the way was his First Lady from Plains. In a life rich with blessings, none was greater for Jimmy than the love he shared with Rosalind and the love the two of them shared with their children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6172.34s)]
*  Like Jimmy, Rosalind was and is a symbol of American compassion. Like no other First Lady in our history, Rosalind Carter is indeed a true citizen of the world. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6191.34s)]
*  And she became a beloved friend to my wife Betty and me and to all the Ford family. While the Carter and Ford men were decidedly mixed record when it came to lobbying Congress, Rosalind and Betty were unbeatable in their advocacy for millions of people whom they brought out of the shadows of despair. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6208.34s)]
*  Now is the time to say goodbye. Our grief comforted with the joy and the thanksgiving of knowing this man, this beloved man, this very special man. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6238.34s)]
*  He was given the gift of years and the American people and the people of the world will be forever blessed by his decades of good works. Jimmy Carter's legacy of peace and compassion will remain unique as it is timeless. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6254.34s)]
*  The entire Ford family, we extend our love to you and we add our prayers to the prayers of tens of millions of people around the world. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6278.34s)]
*  May God bless and watch over this good man. May he grant peace to the Carter family as they say goodbye to a man whose life was lived to the fullest with a faith demonstrated in countless good works, with a mission richly fulfilled and a soul rewarded with the love of God. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6293.34s)]
*  May God bless and watch over this man. May he grant peace to the Carter family as he says goodbye to a man whose life was lived to the fullest with a faith demonstrated in countless good works, with a mission richly fulfilled and a soul rewarded with the love of God. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6323.34s)]
*  Thank you Mr. President. Welcome home old friend. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6340.34s)]
*  And an incredibly incredible eulogy there by the son of President Ford, although it's his father's words. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6370.34s)]
*  It was such a beautiful eulogy there and the fact that it was like a time capsule letter to be read and it held up so well. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6379.34s)]
*  And the story is an important one with Anwar Sadat's funeral where they had that cross-Atlantic time together and just realized that they were meant to be friends, not adversaries, and then started and did something about that by starting to hold all these conferences and policy summits together as a real team for the card. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6388.34s)]
*  I think as President Ford's son said, they shared the same values. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6411.34s)]
*  They did and both were very religious. I mean people forget that Gerald Ford used to do Bible classes on Capitol Hill when he was a congressperson. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6416.34s)]
*  This is Vice President Walter Mondale's son. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6426.34s)]
*  My father wrote this in 2015 and clearly he edited it a couple times since then, but here we go. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6429.34s)]
*  Today we join in sadness to honor our dear friend President Carter for his extraordinary years of principled and decent leadership and his courageous commitment to civil rights and human rights. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6441.34s)]
*  I remember the emergence of Jimmy Carter on the national stage. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6457.34s)]
*  In particular, his 1971 inaugural address. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6462.34s)]
*  For the first time, a Georgia governor called for a commitment to the traditions of Martin Luther King Jr. and for the decency that his leadership stood for over his lifetime. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6467.34s)]
*  I was surprised when then candidate Carter asked me to join in him as his running mate in 1976. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6480.34s)]
*  He amazed me then as he has every year since. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6489.34s)]
*  He of course was brilliant. He also had a great sense of humor. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6494.34s)]
*  And while we had only four years in the White House, he achieved so much in that time. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6500.34s)]
*  It stood as a marker for Americans dedicated to justice and decency. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6507.34s)]
*  Carter was a man of his word. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6515.34s)]
*  I remember when he talked about the concept of the vice presidency. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6519.34s)]
*  I told him I'd like to do it and had only two requests. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6524.34s)]
*  I wanted to make a real contribution and I didn't want to be embarrassed as many of my predecessors have. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6531.34s)]
*  He agreed, welcomed my full participation, and directed his staff to treat me as they would him. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6541.34s)]
*  He was very careful to protect me from the frustration and too often, humiliation had had cursed the lives of many vice presidents. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6551.34s)]
*  I want to thank the president for the good choices he made with his key personnel. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6562.34s)]
*  We don't have time to mention many of them, but Stu Eisenstadt comes as close as possible to rivaling President Carter's formidable work ethic. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6568.34s)]
*  Hamilton Jordan and Jody Powell were blessings every day to me, to the president, and to the nation. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6579.34s)]
*  One of the things that dawned on me during the course of our time together is how well we worked together and how we understood each other. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6591.34s)]
*  I think one of the realities was that Carter was a devout Christian who grew up in a small town and was active in his faith for almost every moment of his life. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6601.34s)]
*  I was also a small town kid who grew up in a Methodist church where my dad was a preacher and our faith was core to me, as Carter's faith was core to him. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6611.34s)]
*  That common commitment to our faith created a bond between us that allowed us to understand each other and find ways to work together. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6623.34s)]
*  He allowed me to take a leadership role on issues that never would have happened before. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6635.34s)]
*  For instance, he directed and trusted me to take a central role in trying to bring decency to the Vietnamese and Southeast Asian boat people who were fleeing their country. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6641.34s)]
*  With President Carter's orders, the boat people were picked up by our great navy from their flimsy boats which were capsizing and taken to safety. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6654.34s)]
*  Most became good American citizens working for a healthy and prosperous nation. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6664.34s)]
*  Joan loved her time as a second lady. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6674.34s)]
*  And we have Jimmy and Rosalyn to thank for helping her champion the public arts and for just being so kind to her. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6679.34s)]
*  These were good years for Joan and I. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6689.34s)]
*  President Carter and I became very close friends. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6694.34s)]
*  We often spent hours together throughout the day. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6699.34s)]
*  We were working on real problems, not wasting time. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6703.34s)]
*  The personal relationship we established while in office continued throughout our life. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6708.34s)]
*  Carter was farsighted. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6716.34s)]
*  He put aside his short-term political interests to tackle challenges that demanded sacrifice to protect our kids and grandkids from future harm. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6719.34s)]
*  Very few people in the 1970s had heard the term climate change. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6731.34s)]
*  Yet Carter put his presidency on the line to pass laws to conserve energy, deregulate new oil and gas prices, and invest in clean, renewable alternatives to fossil fuels. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6737.34s)]
*  It wasn't a perfect program, but thanks to President Carter, U.S. energy consumption declined by 10% between 1979 and 1983. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6752.34s)]
*  In many ways, he laid the foundation for future presidents to come to grips with climate change. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6765.34s)]
*  Some thought he was crazy to fight so hard to pass these laws. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6772.34s)]
*  But he was dead right, and we know that now. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6777.34s)]
*  We also know that President Carter elevated human rights to the top of his agenda. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6784.34s)]
*  Sometimes we forget how seriously he pushed to advance the rights of women. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6790.34s)]
*  He proposed and signed the law extending the period for states to approve the Equal Rights Amendment. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6800.34s)]
*  He appointed women to head the Departments of Commerce, Education, HUD, and what is now HEW. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6806.34s)]
*  Women on his White House staff played crucial roles in developing his highest priority energy and environmental proposals. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6815.34s)]
*  And he dramatically increased the ranks of female circuit and district court judges, including Ruth Bader Ginsburg. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6824.34s)]
*  In all, in all, he appointed five times as many women to the federal bench as all of the previous presidents had from the beginning of our country. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6835.34s)]
*  Two decades ago, President Carter said he believed income inequality was the biggest global issue. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6850.34s)]
*  More recently, in a 2018 commencement address at Liberty University, he said, [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6857.34s)]
*  I think now the largest global issue is the discrimination against women and girls in this world. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6865.34s)]
*  He concluded that until stubborn attitudes and foster discrimination against women change, [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6873.34s)]
*  the world cannot advance and poverty and income equality cannot be solved. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6881.34s)]
*  Towards the end of our time in the White House, the president and I were talking about how we might describe what we tried to accomplish in office. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6890.34s)]
*  We came up with a sentence which remains an important summary of our work. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6900.34s)]
*  We told the truth. We obeyed the law. And we kept the peace. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6905.34s)]
*  That we did, Mr. President. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6913.34s)]
*  I will always be proud and grateful to have had the chance to work with you towards noble ends. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6916.34s)]
*  It was then and will always be the most rewarding experience of my public career. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6924.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6931.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6934.34s)]
*  It was a testament not only to a friendship, but to the vice presidency. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6964.34s)]
*  President Carter and Vice President Mondale revolutionized that office in the late 1970s, giving it much more prominence. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6972.34s)]
*  And that came through in those powerful remarks. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6978.34s)]
*  I mean, Bob, how close were they, Mondale and Carter? [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6981.34s)]
*  You know, I didn't get the impression in those days that they were that close. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6986.34s)]
*  I think they like one another. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6991.34s)]
*  And had a good working relationship. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6995.34s)]
*  I think they had a good working relationship. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=6997.34s)]
*  You know, it was started with one of Jimmy Carter's heroes was Hubert Humphrey because of his civil rights integration stances in the 1940s in Minneapolis. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7001.34s)]
*  And then his commander in chief, Jimmy Carter's Harry S. Truman, is the one who integrated our armed forces. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7011.34s)]
*  And so when he interviewed all the different people he chose for vice president, he connected with Mondale who said and Carter asked Mondale, what, you know, what, what, what, what's your ideas on these various policies? [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7018.34s)]
*  He said, whatever you wrote and why not the best? [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7033.34s)]
*  That's my policy. Well, I'm thinking like you're thinking. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7036.34s)]
*  And they had a laugh. And I think that was the key. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7039.34s)]
*  They could joke together. They didn't have heated moments. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7042.34s)]
*  He was often brought Mondale in the meetings more than any other president before had as a as a co equal and cabinet meetings. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7044.34s)]
*  I'm also struck, too, in for president who served our country almost half a century ago that his vice president wanted to make sure in this eulogy to point out his early efforts of bringing attention to climate change. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7053.34s)]
*  Jimmy Carter and climate change. We can go on for for days on CBS News because he was deeply concerned about the our planets diminishing resources in the way we're not doing proper stewardship. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7068.34s)]
*  Remember, Carter got in trouble with the so-called the crisis of confidence speech because he was scolding Americans basically that we are six percent of the world's population using up 35 percent of the world's natural resources. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7081.34s)]
*  And Carter believed that the sun was eternal. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7097.34s)]
*  And hence why he put the solar panels on the White House, which trying to get us into an alternative energy mode because he knew so clearly there are the scientific evidence was there on the damage of fossil fuels. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7099.34s)]
*  And then Reagan removed those solar panels. And now half a century later, this was a debate even in the short sort of presidential election where the president elect is promising to drill baby drill famously. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7113.34s)]
*  And we're also the other big story that we're watching at this hour, too, is what's happening in L.A. County. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7126.34s)]
*  And not just with the L.A. County, but all of our lakes and rivers and the lands that Jimmy Carter became a watchdog for. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7132.34s)]
*  He one of the first things he did in political life was create the Georgia Conservancy to conserve Georgia coastal lands around Juggle Island, to conserve Okefenokee swamps, to stop a dam at the Chattahoochee River in Georgia. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7140.34s)]
*  And this extended throughout his life. And that's why I became such great friends with Ted Turner. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7156.34s)]
*  I don't think it's here. Ted Turner is 86 and not well, but they were as inseparable as can be. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7163.34s)]
*  And I do think, nor it's worth noticing, that Andy Young was there, which was an important voice to begin at our National Cathedral to hear that. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7171.34s)]
*  Former UN ambassador. Yes. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7180.34s)]
*  I sat down with Ambassador Young recently in Georgia. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7181.34s)]
*  And what a story that's so intertwined with President Carter representing that new South when Atlanta broke and Georgia broke from its segregation is past. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7185.34s)]
*  Andrew Young, not only an ambassador serving in the Carter administration, but went on to be a highly influential mayor of Atlanta, Georgia. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7194.34s)]
*  There today, age 92, worked with President Carter closely on civil rights, race relations, foreign policy and the development of the new South. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7202.34s)]
*  We will hear from him later delivering the homily after President Biden and James Carter. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7213.34s)]
*  Let's James Carter. Let's listen. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7219.34s)]
*  Amen. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7232.34s)]
*  That is former Ambassador Stuart Eisenstadt making his way. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7263.34s)]
*  He was just mentioned by the former vice president's son as being one of the most hardworking members of the administration. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7269.34s)]
*  And he just wrote an important book on President Carter that people should read. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7277.34s)]
*  He was the chief domestic policy advisor and has really been an eyewitness for the successes of President Carter, particularly the Camp David Accord. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7282.34s)]
*  Jimmy Carter was as close to being a renaissance man as any president in the United States. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7292.34s)]
*  He was skilled in an astonishing array of activities. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7302.34s)]
*  Farmer, businessman, nuclear engineer, naval submarine officer, woodworker, painter, fly fisherman, music lover, poet, author, Sunday school teacher. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7310.34s)]
*  Creator of the Carter Center and yes, loving husband, father, grandfather, and great grandfather and Nobel Peace Prize winner. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7320.34s)]
*  Behind that toothy smile was a man of steel, tough, and he was a man of courage. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7331.34s)]
*  And he was a great grandfather and Nobel Peace Prize winner. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7340.34s)]
*  Behind that toothy smile was a man of steel, determination, discipline, and self-confidence. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7344.34s)]
*  In 1974 when he was governor of Georgia, I suggest that if he ran for president and won a few Southern primaries, [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7355.34s)]
*  he might get lucky and be the vice presidential nominee for regional balance. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7366.34s)]
*  With his broadest grin, he said, Stu, I've already decided to run, but I will be the Democratic nominee for president, not vice president. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7373.34s)]
*  For one of our nation's most religious presidents, it's appropriate to celebrate Jimmy Carter's remarkable life in this magnificent cathedral. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7383.34s)]
*  His religious values gave him an unshakable sense of right and wrong, [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7395.34s)]
*  animating his support for civil rights at home and human rights abroad, [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7402.34s)]
*  and propelling him to major achievements as the only Democratic president elected between 1968 and 1992. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7409.34s)]
*  His faith brought integrity to the presidency after the Watergate and Vietnam eras. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7421.34s)]
*  I'll never lie to you, he promised. It was a vow he fulfilled. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7431.34s)]
*  But his faith respected other religions as well. He was the first president to light a Chanukah menorah. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7438.34s)]
*  He created the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, which I have the honor of sharing. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7448.34s)]
*  He had a kosher Shabbat dinner at Camp David for the Israeli delegation, [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7455.34s)]
*  and came to our house for a Passover Seder only weeks after he negotiated the treaty between Israel and Egypt. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7461.34s)]
*  As we lay our 39th president to rest, it's time to redeem his presidency [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7469.34s)]
*  and also lay to rest the myth that his greatest achievements came only as a former president. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7476.34s)]
*  The test of American presidents is not the number of years they serve, but the duration of their accomplishments. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7484.34s)]
*  By this measure, Jimmy Carter was among the most consequential one-term presidents in American history. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7494.34s)]
*  His intellect, prodigious work habits, discipline, and mastery of details were crucial to his success at home and abroad. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7501.34s)]
*  President Carter parked politics at the Oval Office door to do what he believed was the right thing, [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7512.34s)]
*  taking controversial challenges on, regardless of the political consequences, and frankly there were many. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7521.34s)]
*  Much of his agenda passed with bipartisan support, a quaint notion in today's hyper-polarized politics. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7529.34s)]
*  Independent surveys indicated he had one of the highest success rates in passing his major legislation of any American president. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7540.34s)]
*  And he was remarkably accessible to the press and to the American people. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7551.34s)]
*  This president from the deepest part of the deep south, championed civil rights, [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7559.34s)]
*  appointing more people of color and women to senior executive positions and judgeships than all previous 38 presidents before him. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7564.34s)]
*  He created the Department of Education and dramatically increased funding for low and moderate income students. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7575.34s)]
*  And we can thank him for all the ethics in government laws, comprehensive civil service reform, [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7584.34s)]
*  the creation of FEMA to coordinate natural disaster relief and rebuilding that remain crucially important today and we see it in Los Angeles. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7591.34s)]
*  Jimmy Carter was also the greatest environmental president since Theodore Roosevelt, [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7601.34s)]
*  adding 80 million acres in Alaska to the national park system. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7608.34s)]
*  And his Global 2000 Report forecast climate change. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7613.34s)]
*  His energy bills were critical to move our country from dependence on foreign oil to energy security. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7618.34s)]
*  We are now as a result the largest oil and gas producer in the world. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7628.34s)]
*  He provided the first incentives for conservation and inaugurated the era of clean energy [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7636.34s)]
*  and symbolized it with solar panels he installed on the White House roof. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7643.34s)]
*  Underappreciated at the time, but now widely recognized by Republicans and Democrats alike, [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7652.34s)]
*  President Carter was the great deregulator, winning legislative battles to loosen the regulatory bonds and shackles on airlines [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7661.34s)]
*  thereby democratizing air travel, on trucking and rails therefore helping our supply chains be more efficient, [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7673.34s)]
*  telecommunications leading to the cable TV era and even the beer industry, [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7682.34s)]
*  which encouraged local craft beers and he did so without compromising health and safety. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7689.34s)]
*  These laid the foundations for today's innovative economy. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7696.34s)]
*  Nothing better embodies President Carter than how he dealt with the inflation that beleaguered the nation under three presidents, [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7700.34s)]
*  two Republican, Nixon and Ford and himself during the 1970s. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7711.34s)]
*  Over the objection of all of his advisors, he chose Paul Volcker to lead the Federal Reserve, [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7716.34s)]
*  knowing in advance that Volcker's tough monetary policy would raise interest rates and unemployment because Paul told him that [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7725.34s)]
*  and would do so in a presidential election year. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7736.34s)]
*  You take care of the economy, Paul. I'll take care of the politics. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7739.34s)]
*  Inflation indeed dropped like a rock after he left office and remained low for decades. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7745.34s)]
*  Abroad, Jimmy Carter laid the building blocks for a better world. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7755.34s)]
*  He was the first president to make human rights a priority for U.S. foreign policy [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7761.34s)]
*  and this led directly to the release of thousands of political prisoners in Latin America [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7767.34s)]
*  and stimulated them to a lasting democratic transition. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7774.34s)]
*  He ushered in a new era of hemispheric relations with the Panama Canal treaties, [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7778.34s)]
*  the toughest legislative battle of his presidency. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7786.34s)]
*  He uniquely combined the soft power of human rights, [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7789.34s)]
*  championing freedom for the communist East Bloc countries and tripling the emigration of Soviet Jews. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7795.34s)]
*  He combined that with hard power, rebuilding America's military strength after its post-Volga Gate decline. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7801.34s)]
*  He negotiated a major nuclear arms treaty with the Soviets, [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7811.34s)]
*  while at the same time initiated every single weapons system that came online in the 1980s. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7817.34s)]
*  Those new weapons helped end the Cold War. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7826.34s)]
*  He normalized relations with China and even his critics applauded his tough measures after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7829.34s)]
*  Jimmy Carter's most lasting achievement, and the one I think he was most proud of, [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7840.34s)]
*  was to bring the first peace to the Middle East through the greatest act of personal diplomacy in American history, [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7848.34s)]
*  the Camp David Accords. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7855.34s)]
*  For 13 days and nights, he negotiated with Israel's Menachem Begin and Egypt's Anwar Sadat, [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7858.34s)]
*  personally drafting more than 20 peace proposals and shuttling them between the Israeli and Egyptian delegations. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7867.34s)]
*  And he saved the agreement at the 11th hour, and it was the 11th hour, [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7877.34s)]
*  by appealing to Begin's love of his grandchildren. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7882.34s)]
*  For the past 45 years, the Egypt-Israel peace treaty has never been violated and laid the foundation for the Abraham Accords. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7886.34s)]
*  On the other side of the ledger was Iran. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7896.34s)]
*  Jimmy Carter did not lose Iran, but Shaw did. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7900.34s)]
*  But the hostage crisis was a major factor in denying him a second term, despite his support for the Shaw. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7905.34s)]
*  Because he placed the safe return of the hostages above his own political fortunes, [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7916.34s)]
*  he took full responsibility for the failure of the bold hostage rescue mission, [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7923.34s)]
*  and worked tirelessly even after his bitter re-election defeat to Ronald Reagan, [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7929.34s)]
*  securing their release on the last day of his presidency. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7937.34s)]
*  In the end, Jimmy Carter taught all of us how to live a life fulfilled with faith and service. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7941.34s)]
*  He said, I have one life to live. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7950.34s)]
*  I feel like God wants me to do the best I can do with it, to let me live my life so that it will be meaningful. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7955.34s)]
*  Well, Mr. President, you've more than achieved that goal. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7964.34s)]
*  He may not be a candidate for Mount Rushmore, [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7969.34s)]
*  but he belongs in the foothills of making the U.S. stronger and the world safer. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7974.34s)]
*  Jimmy Carter has earned his place in heaven, [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7983.34s)]
*  but just as he was free with sometimes unsolicited advice for his presidential successors, [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7987.34s)]
*  the Lord of all creation should be ready for Jimmy's recommendations on how to make God's realm a more peaceful place. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=7995.34s)]
*  And an incredible eulogy there by Stu Eisenstadt, [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8014.34s)]
*  who has already been praised today as working perhaps the only one who worked harder than President Carter himself, [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8018.34s)]
*  but in many ways also a reminder in his words about what he accomplished, [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8025.34s)]
*  not only in terms of his professional accomplishments, but his personal character. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8029.34s)]
*  And there's a revisionism going in on Carter's studies where people are saying, [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8033.34s)]
*  well, yes, the post-presidency was great, but what about the presidency? [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8037.34s)]
*  And a lot of the one-term accomplishments have really lasted over decades, [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8041.34s)]
*  and particularly with Camp David Accord, it is undeniable that that is one of the epic achievements of the 20th century [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8046.34s)]
*  in the realm of diplomacy, having Egypt and Israel remain tight. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8054.34s)]
*  And what about with Iran? [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8059.34s)]
*  Well, absolutely it is, but with Iran, as they talked about the hostage crisis that in many ways defined the end of his presidency, [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8061.34s)]
*  it was interesting to hear Eisenstadt say it wasn't Jimmy Carter's fault that Iran fell to the Islamic Revolution. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8068.34s)]
*  It was the Shah of Iran. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8073.34s)]
*  Also interesting to have him point out one of the toughest things, the fight against inflation, [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8075.34s)]
*  which peaked at like 13.5% at the end of the Carter administration. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8079.34s)]
*  So many parallels being drawn between that one-term president and Joe Biden and the fight they faced because of the domestic upset. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8083.34s)]
*  In my church, we sing a song that says, [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8090.34s)]
*  from the moment that I wake up until I lay my head, I will sing of the goodness of God. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8093.34s)]
*  I don't know how many people in here can say that. I know I can't. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8104.34s)]
*  But my grandfather certainly can. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8109.34s)]
*  From the moment that he woke up until he laid his head, his life was a testament to the goodness of God. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8112.34s)]
*  And I thank all of you for being here to celebrate this life. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8121.34s)]
*  To the presidents and first ladies, it is a great honor to have you here. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8125.34s)]
*  You know the human side of the American presidency like no others, and we appreciate you. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8131.34s)]
*  To the vice presidents, other distinguished guests, and friends of all kinds, thank you for being here. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8138.34s)]
*  To those of you who came from all across the world, thank you for being here to celebrate and pay tribute to my grandfather. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8144.34s)]
*  I say grandfather, but we called him Papa, as many of you know. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8151.34s)]
*  We called my grandmother Mom Carter, so we spent our time talking about Mom and Papa. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8157.34s)]
*  And mostly, speaking of the human side of the presidency, just letting people know that they were regular folks. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8162.34s)]
*  Yes, they spent four years in the governor's mansion and four years at the White House, but the other 92 years they spent at home in Plains, Georgia. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8168.34s)]
*  And one of the best ways to demonstrate that they were regular folks is to take them by that home. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8175.34s)]
*  First of all, it looks like they might have built it themselves. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8181.34s)]
*  And they were just regular folks. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8185.34s)]
*  And they were just regular folks. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8188.34s)]
*  And one of the best ways to demonstrate that they were regular folks is to take them by that home. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8190.34s)]
*  First of all, it looks like they might have built it themselves. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8194.34s)]
*  Second of all, my grandfather was likely to show up at the door in some 70s short shorts and Crocs. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8200.34s)]
*  And then you'd walk in the house and it was like thousands of other grandparents' house all across the South, fishing trophies on the walls. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8209.34s)]
*  The refrigerator, of course, was papered with pictures of grandchildren and then great-grandchildren. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8217.34s)]
*  Their main phone, of course, had a cord and was stuck to the wall in the kitchen like a museum piece. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8225.34s)]
*  And demonstrating their Depression-era roots, they had a little rack next to the sink where they would hang Ziploc bags to dry. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8233.34s)]
*  And demonstrating that they changed with the times, eventually he did get a cell phone and one time he called me sort of early on in that process. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8241.34s)]
*  And on my phone it said, Papa, mobile. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8252.34s)]
*  So I answered it, of course, I said, hey, Papa. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8255.34s)]
*  He said, who's this? [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8258.34s)]
*  I said, this is Jason. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8261.34s)]
*  He said, what are you doing? [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8264.34s)]
*  I said, I'm not doing anything. You called me. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8267.34s)]
*  He said, I didn't call you. I'm taking a picture. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8269.34s)]
*  Nuclear engineer, right? [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8276.34s)]
*  They were small town people who never forgot who they were and where they were from no matter what happened in their lives. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8281.34s)]
*  But I recognize that we are not here because he was just a regular guy. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8289.34s)]
*  As you've heard from the other speakers, his political life and his presidency for me was not just ahead of its time, it was prophetic. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8296.34s)]
*  He had the courage and strength to stick to his principles even when they were politically unpopular. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8306.34s)]
*  As governor of Georgia half a century ago, he preached an end to racial discrimination and an end to mass incarceration. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8312.34s)]
*  As president in the 1970s, as you've heard, he protected more land than any other president in history. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8319.34s)]
*  50 years ago, he was a climate warrior who pushed for a world where we conserved energy, [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8327.34s)]
*  limited emissions and traded our reliance on fossil fuels for expanded renewable sources. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8333.34s)]
*  By the way, he cut the deficit, wanted to decriminalize marijuana, deregulated so many industries that he gave us cheap flights and as you heard, craft beer. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8338.34s)]
*  Basically all of that was just a waste of energy. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8349.34s)]
*  As president, he was the first millennial. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8352.34s)]
*  And he could make great playlists as we've heard as well. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8356.34s)]
*  Maybe this is unbelievable to you, but in my 49 years, I never perceived a difference between his political life and mine. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8361.34s)]
*  He was the same person no matter who he was with or where he was. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8370.34s)]
*  And for me, that's the definition of integrity. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8376.34s)]
*  That honesty was matched by love, it was matched by faith. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8381.34s)]
*  And he was the same person no matter who he was with or where he was. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8387.34s)]
*  And for me, that's the definition of integrity. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8392.34s)]
*  That honesty was matched by love, it was matched by faith. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8396.34s)]
*  And in both public and private, my grandparents did fundamentally live their lives in an effort, as the Bible says, to do justice, love mercy and walk humbly with their God. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8401.34s)]
*  Sometimes I feel and felt like I shared my grandfather with the world. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8416.34s)]
*  Today is one of those days. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8422.34s)]
*  But really he shared the world with me. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8425.34s)]
*  The power of an atom, the beauty and complexity of a South Georgia forest. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8429.34s)]
*  When we fished, he celebrated the majesty of everything from the smallest minnow to that grand circulation of waters. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8434.34s)]
*  And he shared this love with my boys, taking these Atlanta public school kids out into the fields to show them about row crops and wild plums. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8442.34s)]
*  In the end, his life is a love story. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8453.34s)]
*  And of course it's a love story about Jimmy and Rosalynn and their 77 years of marriage and service. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8458.34s)]
*  As the song says, they were the flagship of the fleet. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8466.34s)]
*  And rest assured that in these last weeks, he told us that he was ready to see her again. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8470.34s)]
*  But his life was also a broader love story. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8477.34s)]
*  About love for his fellow humans and about living out the commandment to love your neighbor as yourself. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8482.34s)]
*  I believe that that love is what taught him and told him to preach the power of human rights, not just for some people, but for all people. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8489.34s)]
*  It focused him on the power and the promise of democracy, its love for freedom, its requirement and founding belief in the wisdom of regular people raising their voices. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8500.34s)]
*  And the requirement that you respect all of those voices, not just some. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8510.34s)]
*  That conviction made him a naval officer who believed and demonstrated, as you've heard, that the greatest power of America was not the military, but its values. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8516.34s)]
*  And those values were personal to him, and he lived them both publicly and privately. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8527.34s)]
*  As you heard Stu say, as president, he gave voice to dissidents, stood up to dictators, brought countries together in peace. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8534.34s)]
*  His heart broke for the people of Israel. It broke for the people of Palestine. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8544.34s)]
*  And he spent his life trying to bring peace to that holy land. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8551.34s)]
*  And he talked about it at the dinner table. It was the same in public as it was in private. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8556.34s)]
*  And for the last 40 years, as you've heard, he spent his time living out that love and that faith alongside the poorest and most marginalized people in the world. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8563.34s)]
*  And that work, again, has been based fundamentally on love and respect. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8575.34s)]
*  The Carter Center has 3,500 employees, but only a couple hundred in the United States. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8582.34s)]
*  The rest are spread throughout the countries where we work. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8588.34s)]
*  Ethiopia, South Sudan, Chad, Bangladesh, and all of the Carter Center's programs are based on a respect, that same respect, for the power of regular people, even if they are in tiny villages miles from anywhere else. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8593.34s)]
*  To give one example, we've all heard a lot lately about Guinea worm disease. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8610.34s)]
*  It's an ancient and debilitating disease of poverty. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8615.34s)]
*  And that disease will have existed from the dawn of humanity until Jimmy Carter. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8619.34s)]
*  When he started working on this disease, there were 3.5 million cases in humans every year. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8624.34s)]
*  Last year there were 14. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8632.34s)]
*  And the thing that's remarkable is that this disease is not eliminated with medicine. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8634.34s)]
*  It's eliminated essentially by neighbors talking to neighbors about how to collect water in the poorest and most marginalized villages in the world. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8640.34s)]
*  And those neighbors truly were my grandfather's partners for the last 40 years. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8649.34s)]
*  And as this disease has been eliminated in every village in Nigeria, every village in Sudan or Uganda, what's left behind in those tiny 600-person villages is an army of Jimmy and Rosalynn Carters who have demonstrated their own power to change their world. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8656.34s)]
*  And that is a fundamental truth about my grandfather. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8675.34s)]
*  It begins where it ends. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8679.34s)]
*  When he saw a tiny 600-person village that everybody else thinks of as poor, he recognized it. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8681.34s)]
*  That's where he was from. That's who he was. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8690.34s)]
*  And he never saw it as a place to send pity. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8693.34s)]
*  It was always a place to find partnership and power and a place to carry out that commandment to love your neighbor as yourself. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8697.34s)]
*  Essentially, he eradicated a disease with love and respect. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8705.34s)]
*  He waged peace with love and respect. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8711.34s)]
*  He led this nation with love and respect. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8715.34s)]
*  To me, this life was a love story from the moment that he woke up until he laid his head. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8720.34s)]
*  I'll conclude with this. As Andy Young told me, he may be gone, but he's not gone far. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8729.34s)]
*  The outpouring of love and support that we have felt from you and from around the world shows how many lives he has touched and how his spirit will live on in many ways for us. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8740.34s)]
*  He'll be in the kitchen making pancakes, or in his wood shop finishing a cradle for a great-grandchild. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8754.34s)]
*  Standing in a trout stream of Mom Carter, or for me, just walking those Georgia fields and forests where he's from. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8764.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8776.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8778.34s)]
*  It was Jason Carter, the grandson of President Carter, talking about his pawpaw, saying that, of course, his grandparents were small-town people who never forget where they came from. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8784.34s)]
*  That he was a regular guy, but he was more than that. He was prophetic and he stuck to his principles. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8795.34s)]
*  The fact of the matter is that he's right, Jason. It's the sticking to the principles that is so impressive. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8800.34s)]
*  I love the idea that he was born into love. He loved Earth. He loved being here. He loved everything about the planet. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8809.34s)]
*  Then, of course, he was talking about the Middle East. Jason worked with his grandfather trying to do that two-state solution in Palestine that has been proven so elusive. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8816.34s)]
*  Jason did just a beautiful job there. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8827.34s)]
*  That was one good speech. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8830.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8833.34s)]
*  Some humor there as well. It was interesting to hear him talk about his grandfather and say he was the first millennial. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8834.34s)]
*  In some ways, he was a very hard-to-define Democrat, but a lot of the positions he had, the views he had, you would almost put in the progressive bucket of labels these days. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8842.34s)]
*  One of the things he said most recently about Israel and Palestine that became controversial was talking about Israel as an apartheid state. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8853.34s)]
*  He used that word. It drew a lot of scrutiny from some of his fellow Democrats, some criticism as well. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8862.34s)]
*  But he has been very much the forefront in staying involved in the issue. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8868.34s)]
*  I went with... [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8872.34s)]
*  Let's pause to listen to Amazing Grace. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8873.34s)]
*  Yeah, I went with... [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8875.34s)]
*  I was blind, but now I see. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8883.34s)]
*  Just grace the talk thy heart to fear and grace my fears. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8913.34s)]
*  Relief, how precious did the grace appear, thee how I first believed. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8932.34s)]
*  Oh, many dangers toils the seers, [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8962.34s)]
*  thy hemorrhage cold. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=8986.34s)]
*  Just grace has grown, be safe thus far, thy grace will lead me home. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9000.34s)]
*  Grace, I will lead me home. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9018.34s)]
*  Well, if you just got the chills from Phyllis Adams, a soprano, wait till you hear who she is. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9048.34s)]
*  She's a longtime Delta flight attendant who first met President Carter in 2017 at the Carter Center Human Rights Defenders Forum, where she was a musical guest. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9068.34s)]
*  And Mrs. Carter was so impressed with her performance that they asked her to sing at his funeral. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9078.34s)]
*  Wow, what an amazing story. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9084.34s)]
*  It's an incredible story. We are set now to hear from the President of the United States, Joe Biden, who just placed his hand on the casket, genuflected, and now is set to remember his friend Jimmy Carter on this National Day of Mourning. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9086.34s)]
*  Leaders of the clergy, distinguished guests, most important to the Carter family. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9105.34s)]
*  In April 2021, Jill and I visited Jimmy and Rosalynn on a warm spring day down in Plains, Georgia. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9113.34s)]
*  We wanted to see them. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9127.34s)]
*  Rosalynn met us at the front door with her signature smile. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9129.34s)]
*  Together, we entered a home that they had shared for almost 77 years of marriage. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9137.34s)]
*  An unassuming red-brick ranch home reflects their modesty more than any trappings of power. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9143.34s)]
*  We walked in a living room where Jimmy greeted us like family. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9152.34s)]
*  That day, just the four of us sat in the living room and shared memories that spanned almost six decades. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9157.34s)]
*  A deep friendship that started in 1974. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9167.34s)]
*  I was a 31-year-old senator, and I was the first senator outside of Georgia, maybe the first senator, to endorse his candidacy for president. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9171.34s)]
*  It was an endorsement based on what I believe is Jimmy Carter's enduring attribute, character, character, character. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9184.34s)]
*  Because of that character, I believe it is destiny, destiny in our lives, and quite frankly, destiny in the life of the nation. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9199.34s)]
*  It's an accumulation of a million things built on character that leads to a good life in a decent country. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9211.34s)]
*  Life of purpose, life of meaning. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9221.34s)]
*  Now, how do we find that good life? [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9225.34s)]
*  What does it look like? [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9229.34s)]
*  What does it take to build character? [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9233.34s)]
*  Do the ends justify the means? [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9236.34s)]
*  Jimmy Carter's friendship taught me, and through his life taught me, the strength of character is more than title or the power we hold. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9240.34s)]
*  It's the strength to understand that everyone should be treated with dignity, respect, that everyone should be treated with respect. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9252.34s)]
*  Everyone, and I mean everyone, deserves an even shot, not a guarantee that this is a shot. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9266.34s)]
*  You know, we have an obligation to give hate no safe harbor. [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9273.34s)]
*  And to stand up to what my dad just said is the greatest sin of all, the abuse of power. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9282.34s)]
*  That's not about being perfect, because none of us are perfect. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9290.34s)]
*  We're all fallible. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9296.34s)]
*  But it's about asking ourselves, are we striving to do things, the right things? [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9297.34s)]
*  What values, what are the values that animate our spirit? [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9304.34s)]
*  Do we operate from fear or hope, ego or generosity? [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9309.34s)]
*  Do we show grace? [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9316.34s)]
*  Do we keep the faith when it's most tested? [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9319.34s)]
*  For keeping the faith with the best of humankind and the best of America is a story, in my view, from my perspective, of Jimmy Carter's life. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9323.34s)]
*  The story of a man, to state the obvious, you've heard today from the great, great eulogies, who came from a house without running water or electricity, [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9336.34s)]
*  and rose as a pinnacle of power. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9349.34s)]
*  The story of a man who was at once driven and devoted to making real the words of his savior and the ideals of this nation. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9353.34s)]
*  The story of a man who never let the tides of politics divert him from his mission to serve and shape the world. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9366.34s)]
*  The man had character. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9378.34s)]
*  Jimmy held a deep Christian faith in God, and that is Ken as he spoke and wrote about. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9382.34s)]
*  Faith as a substance of things hoped for and evidence of the things not seen. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9391.34s)]
*  Faith founded on commandments of scripture. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9401.34s)]
*  Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy mind and all thy soul, and love thy neighbor as thyself. [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9407.34s)]
*  Easy to say, but very, very difficult to do. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9417.34s)]
*  In his life, in this life, any walk of faith can be difficult. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9423.34s)]
*  It can be lonely, but it requires action to be the doers of the world. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9430.34s)]
*  But in that commandment lies the essence, in my view, found in the gospel, found in many faith traditions, and found in the very idea of America. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9436.34s)]
*  Because the very journey of our nation is a walk of sheer faith. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9447.34s)]
*  To do the work, to be the country we say we are, to be the country we say we want to be. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9455.34s)]
*  A nation where all are created equal in the image of God and deserved to be treated equally throughout our lives. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9462.34s)]
*  We've never fully lived up to that idea of America. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9472.34s)]
*  We've never walked away from it either because of patriots like Jimmy Carter. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9476.34s)]
*  Throughout his life, he showed us what it means to be a true Christian. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9483.34s)]
*  Throughout his life, he showed us what it means to be a practitioner of good works and a good and faithful servant of God and of the people. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9489.34s)]
*  And today, many think he was from a bygone era. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9500.34s)]
*  But in reality, he saw well into the future. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9506.34s)]
*  A white Southern Baptist who led on civil rights. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9512.34s)]
*  A decorated Navy veteran who brokered peace. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9518.34s)]
*  A brilliant nuclear engineer who led on nuclear nonproliferation. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9523.34s)]
*  A hardworking farmer who championed conservation and clean energy. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9530.34s)]
*  And a president who redefined the relationship with the vice president. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9535.34s)]
*  Jimmy and I often talked about our dear friend Walter Mondale, whom we all miss very much. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9543.34s)]
*  Together, they formed a model partnership of collaboration and trust, because both were men of character. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9550.34s)]
*  And as we all know, Jimmy Carter also established a model post presidency by making a powerful difference as a private citizen in America. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9560.34s)]
*  And, I might add, as you all know, around the world. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9573.34s)]
*  Through it all, he showed us how character and faith start with ourselves and then flows to others. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9577.34s)]
*  At our best, we share the better parts of ourselves. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9585.34s)]
*  Joy, solidarity, love, commitment. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9591.34s)]
*  Not for reward, but in reverence for the incredible gift of life we've all been granted. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9597.34s)]
*  To make every minute of our time here on earth count, that's what we do. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9607.34s)]
*  That's the definition of a good life. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9615.34s)]
*  A life Jimmy Carter lived during his 100 years. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9618.34s)]
*  To young people, to anyone in search of meaning and purpose, study the power of Jimmy Carter's example. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9624.34s)]
*  I miss him, but I take solace in knowing that he and his beloved Rosalynn are reunited again. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9636.34s)]
*  To the entire Carter family, thank you. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9646.34s)]
*  And I mean this sincerely, for sharing them both with America and the world. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9651.34s)]
*  We love you all. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9659.34s)]
*  Jill and I will cherish our visits with them, including that last one in their home. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9660.34s)]
*  We saw Jimmy as he always was, at peace with a life fully lived. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9666.34s)]
*  A good life, a purpose and meaning, of character driven by destiny. [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9674.34s)]
*  And filled with the power of faith, hope and love. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9682.34s)]
*  I'll say it again, faith, hope and love. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9688.34s)]
*  As he returned to Plains, Georgia for his final resting place, we could say goodbye in the words of the prophet Micah, [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9693.34s)]
*  who Jimmy so admired until his final breath. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9704.34s)]
*  Jimmy Carter did justly, loved mercy, walked humbly. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9707.34s)]
*  May God bless a great American and a dear friend and a good man. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9716.34s)]
*  May he rise up, be raised up on eagle's wings and bear you on the breath of dawn and make you to shine like the sun. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9721.34s)]
*  And hold you in the palm of his hand. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9730.34s)]
*  God bless you, Jimmy Carter. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9734.34s)]
*  And President Biden describing his lifelong friendship with Jimmy Carter, [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9744.34s)]
*  beginning when he was a newly elected senator and mayor. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9750.34s)]
*  And making this eulogy much, but a larger statement about character. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9753.34s)]
*  A devout Roman Catholic eulogizing a devout evangelical Christian president from the small city of Scranton, Pennsylvania, [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9757.34s)]
*  talking about a man from Plains, two lives interwoven in terms of the world. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9766.34s)]
*  And he's talking about a man from Plains, a man from the United States, [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9773.34s)]
*  a man from Plains, two lives interwoven in terms of their politics, their sense of character and mission. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9779.34s)]
*  Joe Biden has delivered so many eulogies in his time and he always ends so prophetically. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9787.34s)]
*  And it is one of the great traits of Joe Biden is that he does not miss attending. [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9796.34s)]
*  He's the president of the United States. Of course, he was going to be there, but he does care so deeply about people and making sure to eulogize them. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9802.34s)]
*  He does. And I think it means so much to him or meant when his first wife died in the auto crash and that incredible tragedy. [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9806.34s)]
*  And people like Richard Nixon, then president, reached out to Joe Biden and Jimmy Carter when they connected, [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9816.34s)]
*  Biden and Carter with at a J.C.'s meeting in Atlanta, were able to talk and commiserate about pain and sorrow. [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9824.34s)]
*  And so they humanized their relationship in the 1970s and it's continued until Carter died. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9831.34s)]
*  This is James Carter. A reading from the gospel according to Saint Matthew. [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9840.34s)]
*  Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9845.34s)]
*  His disciples came to him and he began to teach them, saying, [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9851.34s)]
*  Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9855.34s)]
*  Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9861.34s)]
*  Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9865.34s)]
*  Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9870.34s)]
*  Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9876.34s)]
*  Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9880.34s)]
*  Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God. [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9886.34s)]
*  Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9893.34s)]
*  Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9900.34s)]
*  Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9909.34s)]
*  for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9914.34s)]
*  You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9919.34s)]
*  It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled by men. [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9927.34s)]
*  You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9932.34s)]
*  Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9938.34s)]
*  Instead, they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9942.34s)]
*  In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9947.34s)]
*  The word of the Lord. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9956.34s)]
*  Amen. [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9958.34s)]
*  And now we're set to hear a homily from the Reverend Andrew Young, the former United States Ambassador to the United Nations. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9962.34s)]
*  I know you've spoken with him, Robert. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9982.34s)]
*  One of the great figures of the Carter story, Ambassador Andrew Young, got to know Carter when the then state senator, then governor, was making his way up through segregationist Georgia. [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9984.34s)]
*  He once told me that he was a little bit wary of Carter at first. Was Carter part of that Lester Maddox racist crew of Democrats in Georgia? [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=9999.34s)]
*  They eventually, of course, became close friends and confidants, sharing a sense of faith, and importantly a sense of human rights and commitment to the world. [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10007.34s)]
*  Andrew Young and Jimmy Carter wanted to be more than just the South, more than just political figures, but leaders worldwide. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10017.34s)]
*  The Apostle Paul, in writing to the Ephesians, the fourth chapter of the 32nd verse, be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ, God forgave them. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10024.34s)]
*  Jimmy Carter, for me, was something of a miracle. I was born in the deep South, shortly a few years after him, and it was always a place of miracles. [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10052.34s)]
*  I couldn't see how we could have had the differences in background, the coming from different places on the planet, the experiences of slave and slave owner, the diversity of color and creed, and national origin. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10076.34s)]
*  And still become the great nation that we are in the United States of America. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10106.34s)]
*  It was something of a miracle, and I don't mean this with any disrespect, but it's still hard for me to understand how you could get to be president from Plains, Georgia. [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10118.34s)]
*  I knew Plains from my pastorate in Thomasville, Georgia, about 60-70 miles south of there, and I was even nervous driving through Plains. [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10148.34s)]
*  Plains and Sumter County gave us one of the meanest experiences that we had in the Civil Rights Movement, so much so that Martin Luther King said that the sheriff of Plains, of Sumter County, he really thought was the meanest man in the world. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10166.34s)]
*  And when I first met Jimmy Carter, running for governor, and said the only thing I know about Plains and Sumter County is Fred Chappell. [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10193.34s)]
*  And he said, oh yes, he's one of my good friends. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10208.34s)]
*  And that was the last thing I wanted to hear. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10215.34s)]
*  And yet time and time again, I saw in him the ability to achieve greatness by the diversity of his personality and his upbringing. [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10219.34s)]
*  Dr. King used to say that greatness is characterized by antitheses strongly marked. You've got to have a tough mind and a tender heart. [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10242.34s)]
*  And that was Jimmy Carter. And he grew up in the tremendous diversity of the South, and he embraced both sides. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10256.34s)]
*  He was a minority in Sumter County. Just about 20-25% of the population was white. [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10265.34s)]
*  But growing up as a minority, he became the friend of the majority. [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10280.34s)]
*  And when he went to the Naval Academy, he asked that his roommate be the first black midshipman to come to Annapolis. [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10290.34s)]
*  And he said, I know minorities. I've been a minority most of my life, and maybe I can help him in his adjustments. [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10304.34s)]
*  And he went out of his way to embrace those of us who had grown up in all kinds of conflict. [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10314.34s)]
*  But that was the sensitivity, the spirituality that made James Earl Carter a truly great president. [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10333.34s)]
*  James Earl Carter was truly a child of God. Not only a good farmer, but a nuclear physicist chosen by Admiral Rickover to assist him in developing a nuclear navy. [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10348.34s)]
*  But at the same time he was working on a nuclear navy, he was thinking of peace on earth and goodwill toward all men, and especially women and children. [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10371.34s)]
*  I've known President Carter for more than half of my life, and I never cease to be surprised. I never cease to be enlightened. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10387.34s)]
*  I never cease to be inspired by the little deeds of love and mercy that he shared with us every day of his life. [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10402.34s)]
*  It was President James Earl Carter that for me symbolized the greatness of the United States of America. [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10415.34s)]
*  And I am truly grateful for him because in spite of the harshness of the Depression and the explosions of inflation, he never wavered from his commitment to God Almighty and his love of all of God's children. [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10425.34s)]
*  Jimmy Carter was a blessing that helped to create a great United States of America. [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10450.34s)]
*  And for all of us and many who are not able to be here, I want to say thank you. [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10462.34s)]
*  You have been a blessing from God, and your spirit will remain with us. [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10473.34s)]
*  And as Jason said, he may be gone, but he ain't gone far. [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10483.34s)]
*  Thank you, President Carter, and thank you Almighty God. [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10490.34s)]
*  Reverend Andrew Young, the age of 92, delivering one of the most powerful eulogies today without notes. [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10501.34s)]
*  We chyroned him, as we say, as the former ambassador to the UN, but he is also known, of course, as the close aide of Martin Luther King Jr. [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10511.34s)]
*  and had so much to do in the Birmingham campaign, the March on Washington in the 1960s, calling Jimmy Carter a miracle. [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10519.34s)]
*  I thought it could have gone on for another 15 minutes. [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10527.34s)]
*  And I would have enjoyed listening. [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10532.34s)]
*  I really would have. His voice was pitch perfect, as always. It was reverential. [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10533.34s)]
*  But he was also going right to the heart of what race was like in the South, in Sumter County, Georgia, in those days, [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10538.34s)]
*  and how President Carter had to transcend all of that, the Jim Crow South, and learn how to shed it for a more integrated world. [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10544.34s)]
*  We are listening now to Tricia Yearwood and Garth Brooks singing Imagine, because Jimmy Carter asked them to. [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10555.34s)]
*  And he was also rebuked once by Jimmy Carter at Habitat Humanities. Jimmy Carter said, Get up and keep working. [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10563.34s)]
*  Even though they're in Haiti, they're not over 100 degrees. Let's listen. [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10570.34s)]
*  Let's listen. [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10574.34s)]
*  There's no country. [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10604.34s)]
*  It isn't hard to do. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10609.34s)]
*  Nothing to kill or die for. [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10615.34s)]
*  No religion to. [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10622.34s)]
*  Imagine. [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10628.34s)]
*  Living. [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10634.34s)]
*  You. [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10639.34s)]
*  You may say I'm a dreamer. [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10642.34s)]
*  I'm not the only one. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10648.34s)]
*  I hope someday you'll join us. [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10654.34s)]
*  And the world will be his world. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10661.34s)]
*  Imagine no possession. [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10667.34s)]
*  I wonder if you can. [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10674.34s)]
*  No need for greed or hunger. [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10680.34s)]
*  Brotherhood of man. [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10687.34s)]
*  Imagine all the people. [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10694.34s)]
*  Sharing all the world. [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10700.34s)]
*  You. [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10705.34s)]
*  You may say I'm a dreamer. [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10708.34s)]
*  I'm not the only one. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10715.34s)]
*  I hope someday you'll join us. [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10721.34s)]
*  And the world will live as one. [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10728.34s)]
*  Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10758.34s)]
*  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10770.34s)]
*  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10776.34s)]
*  as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10782.34s)]
*  Divine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever and ever. [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10791.34s)]
*  Amen. [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10797.34s)]
*  As I mentioned, as we just heard, imagine and of course that reminder about Jimmy Carter's efforts towards peace is what I keep thinking about, that that was really at the center also of his presidency. [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10813.34s)]
*  It was, and you know, his favorite song was Ray Charles' version of George On My Mind. [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10824.34s)]
*  Imagine this about the post-presidency. [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10829.34s)]
*  Praise our Lord Jesus Christ who said, I am the resurrection and I am life. [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10832.34s)]
*  Lord, you console Martha and Mary in their distress. [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10839.34s)]
*  Draw near to us who mourn for James and dry the tears of those who weep. [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10843.34s)]
*  You weep at the grave of Lazarus, your friend. [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10854.34s)]
*  Comfort us in our sorrow. [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10858.34s)]
*  You raise the dead to life. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10864.34s)]
*  Give to our brother eternal life. [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10867.34s)]
*  Hear us, Lord. [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10871.34s)]
*  You promised paradise to the thief who repented. [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10873.34s)]
*  Bring our brother to joys of heaven. [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10877.34s)]
*  Hear us, Lord. [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10882.34s)]
*  Our brother was washed in baptism and anointed with the Holy Spirit. [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10884.34s)]
*  Give him fellowship with all your saints. [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10890.34s)]
*  Hear us, Lord. [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10894.34s)]
*  Lord, comfort us in our sorrows at the death of our brother. [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10897.34s)]
*  Let our faith be our constellation and eternal life our hope. [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10903.34s)]
*  Hear us, Lord. [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10911.34s)]
*  Father of all, we pray to you for James and for all those whom we love but see no longer. [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10918.34s)]
*  Grant to them eternal rest. [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10926.34s)]
*  Let light perpetual shine upon them. [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10930.34s)]
*  May his soul and the souls of all the departed through the mercy of God rest in peace. [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10933.34s)]
*  Amen. [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=10942.34s)]

*  Amen. [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11008.34s)]
*  Give rest, O Christ, to your servant with your saints, [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11025.34s)]

*  You only are immortal, the creator and maker of humankind, [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11038.34s)]

*  For so did you ordain when you created me, saying, You are dust, and to dust you shall return. [[03:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11052.34s)]
*  All of us go down to the dust, yet even at the grave we make our song, [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11060.34s)]
*  Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. [[03:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11068.34s)]
*  Give rest, O Christ, to your servant with your saints, [[03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11073.34s)]

*  Acknowledge, we humbly beseech you, a sheep of your own fold, [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11094.34s)]
*  a lamb of your own flock, a sinner of your own redeeming. [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11101.34s)]
*  Receive him into the arms of your mercy, into the blessed rest of everlasting peace, [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11108.34s)]
*  and into the glorious company of the saints in light. [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11115.34s)]
*  Amen. [[03:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11120.34s)]
*  The Lord bless you and keep you. [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11122.34s)]
*  The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious unto you. [[03:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11124.34s)]
*  The Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11128.34s)]
*  Amen. [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11132.34s)]
*  Let us go forth in the name of Christ. [[03:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11134.34s)]
*  Thanks be to God. [[03:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11137.34s)]
*  And this marks the conclusion of the state funeral for Jimmy Carter, the 39th President of the United States. [[03:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11148.34s)]
*  A funeral attended by all of the living presidents of the United States, [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11156.34s)]
*  many of their vice presidents too, and world dignitaries and lawmakers [[03:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11161.34s)]
*  packed into this beautiful Washington National Cathedral. [[03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11167.34s)]
*  Remembered today as a great humanitarian, a farmer, a nuclear engineer, a submariner, [[03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11172.34s)]
*  and a president who cared deeply about, in the words of President Biden, [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11180.34s)]
*  character, character, character. [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11185.34s)]
*  We're joined here by presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, [[03:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11189.34s)]
*  who's written about the Carters and spent a great deal of time with them. [[03:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11192.34s)]
*  I think you're right. [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11195.34s)]
*  Biden's word of character, character matters in leadership, [[03:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11196.34s)]
*  and that's come across this entire week. [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11200.34s)]
*  I reflect on when Mahatma Gandhi died, [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11203.34s)]
*  and George Orwell, the great writer, used to just beat up and criticize Gandhi all the time [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11207.34s)]
*  for salt marches and spinning looms. [[03:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11213.34s)]
*  And suddenly Orwell wrote, now that he's gone, what a clean smell he left behind. [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11216.34s)]
*  And we're in a Washington, D.C. now that has dysfunction, [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11222.34s)]
*  and we remember Carter because of the integrity that he brought wherever he went [[03:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11226.34s)]
*  and how hard he did old-fashioned duty on our country to his family, to his friends, [[03:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11231.34s)]
*  and it was all there on display today at the National Cathedral. [[03:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11238.34s)]
*  Margaret Brennan, our host of Face the Nation, all presidents have complicated legacies, [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11243.34s)]
*  and while President Carter is mostly remembered for some, the Iranian hostage crisis, [[03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11249.34s)]
*  he also had so many big wins on foreign policy. [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11257.34s)]
*  He did, and it's with that passage of time you can say, [[03:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11260.34s)]
*  yes, there was an inflation crisis, yes, there was a hostage crisis, [[03:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11264.34s)]
*  there was a lot that went wrong, but the lasting impact of some of the building blocks, [[03:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11268.34s)]
*  such as those Camp David forts, transformed the region [[03:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11272.34s)]
*  and maintained the most significant foundation of peace in the Middle East [[03:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11275.34s)]
*  when Egypt and Israel, they still abide by the terms of that agreement, [[03:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11280.34s)]
*  and that has really been foundational for further diplomatic building. [[03:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11285.34s)]
*  The U.S. and China still have diplomatic ties, although now facing each other [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11289.34s)]
*  as perhaps the greatest adversaries on the global stage, but he helped reopen those ties. [[03:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11294.34s)]
*  He did a lot in addition to his work post-presidency, [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11300.34s)]
*  but those two achievements, very signature achievements of his time in office, [[03:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11303.34s)]
*  as Stu Eisenstadt, the former ambassador, said, [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11307.34s)]
*  don't overlook some of what was accomplished when he was commander-in-chief. [[03:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11310.34s)]
*  And Robert Costa, I'm thinking about the profound eulogy today [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11315.34s)]
*  by Reverend Andrew Young, the close aide to Martin Luther King, [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11319.34s)]
*  who talked about this son of the South, Jimmy Carter. [[03:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11323.34s)]
*  What we saw today was not only the affirmation of a life, [[03:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11326.34s)]
*  but an affirmation of the promise of America, that a boy from Plains, Georgia, [[03:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11330.34s)]
*  living by a creed of working hard, trusting in God, and having no fear, [[03:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11336.34s)]
*  can become a global leader and president of the United States. [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11342.34s)]
*  And it's a testament to the values of this country, as well as the values of this late president. [[03:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11346.34s)]
*  Bob Schieffer, I know you've spoken in your career with 11 men [[03:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11352.34s)]
*  who went on to become president of the United States, [[03:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11356.34s)]
*  and you've described Jimmy Carter as among, if not the most, unpretentious. [[03:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11359.34s)]
*  That's exactly right, and I come away from today thinking about [[03:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11364.34s)]
*  this was a man who for nearly 50 years, when he saw wrong, he tried to make it right. [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11369.34s)]
*  Sometimes he was able to, and sometimes he wasn't. [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11376.34s)]
*  You might not have liked his politics of the moment from time to time, [[03:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11381.34s)]
*  but you could only admire his values and his courage. [[03:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11385.34s)]
*  Integrity, a hallmark of his character. [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11391.34s)]
*  Thanks to all of you, and President Carter's casket will now be taken by motorcade [[03:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11395.34s)]
*  to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland for the flight aboard a plane from the presidential fleet. [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11401.34s)]
*  It's been dubbed Special Air Mission 39 in honor of the 39th president. [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11407.34s)]
*  This afternoon, there will be a private service in Plains at the Maranatha Baptist Church, [[03:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11413.34s)]
*  where Mr. Carter taught Sunday school for many decades. [[03:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11418.34s)]
*  Then the former president will be laid to rest next to his wife of 77 years, [[03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11423.34s)]
*  former first lady Rosalynn Carter, a true love story buried together outside the home they built together in 1961. [[03:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11429.34s)]
*  I want to thank Bob Schieffer, Leslie Stahl, Douglas Brinkley, Margaret Brennan, Robert Costa, [[03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcQ8rOwi6Q&t=11439.34s)]
