# Smith spars with RFK Jr. over school shootings, antidepressants
**CBS News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M)
*  Senator Smith. Mr. Chair, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair and Ranking Member, and welcome, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Kennedy. So, Mr. Kennedy, I don't have a question for you on abortion. I think that [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=6.4s)]
*  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have covered this, but I want to say I can respect [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  people who have different views than mine on this issue, but it's hard for me to respect [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=17.44s)]
*  people who won't give a straight answer to what they think on this issue in particular. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=22.12s)]
*  Mr. Chair, I just want to note that I understand that anti-choice advocates have said that in [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=26.24s)]
*  these hearings they were looking to hear Mr. Kennedy provide some reassurance that he is on [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=30.64s)]
*  their side, and I'm not hearing that. And I think most Americans are looking for some hint that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=35.2s)]
*  the decisions that people make about abortion should be personal and private, and they should [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=41.92s)]
*  be free to make those decisions without government interference, and I'm not hearing that either. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=46.64s)]
*  To make it worse, the answers that you have given tell me that the Trump administration [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=51.44s)]
*  is more than willing to restrict or even ban medication abortion without a single act of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=56.64s)]
*  Congress, and even in states where abortion is legal. And what is clear to me is that you and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=62.4s)]
*  President Trump are dangerous to women's access to methamphetamine. So having said that, I want to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=68.08s)]
*  move to a different topic. Mr. Kennedy, I appreciate Senator Cornyn's questions about [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=74.08s)]
*  mental and behavioral health, something that I care a lot about. I know that you and your family [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=79.44s)]
*  have had personal experience with mental health challenges, as have I. And I agree that the mental [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=84.48s)]
*  health crisis in this country is a crisis. So let me ask you, in an interview in 2023 and again in [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=90.08s)]
*  2024, you blamed school shootings on antidepressants. You said, and this is a quote, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=98.56s)]
*  there is no time in American history or human history that kids were going to shoot schools [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=104.8s)]
*  and shooting their classmates. It really started happening coterminous with the introduction of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=110.4s)]
*  these drugs, with Prozac and with other drugs. So do you believe, as you've said, that antidepressants [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=115.36s)]
*  cause school shootings? This should be a simple question. I don't think anybody can answer that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=121.12s)]
*  question, and I didn't answer that question. I said it should be studied along with other [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=125.84s)]
*  potential culprits like social media. But I don't know. I would never make, because there's [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=132.24s)]
*  no science on that, Senator. Well, there is, Senator. Excuse me. There is, Mr. Kennedy. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=139.52s)]
*  Thank you for the promotion. The science shows that there is no link between school shootings [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  and antidepressants. And in fact, most school shooters were not even treated with antidepressants. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=150.24s)]
*  And of those that were, there was no evidence of association. I don't think you can say that, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  Senator, because HIPAA rules, nobody knows. Well, that is, Mr. Kennedy, do you think that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=160.72s)]
*  people who take antidepressants are dangerous? Listen, I'm not going into HHS, if I'm privileged [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=166.88s)]
*  to be confirmed, to impose any preconceived ideas that I may have. I just want to have good science. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=176.88s)]
*  So you're not saying that they aren't dangerous, which means that they could be dangerous. Let me [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=186.0s)]
*  ask you this. That's not true. You described Americans who take mental health medications as [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=189.92s)]
*  addicts who need to be sent to wellness farms to recover. Is that what you believe? Of course, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  I didn't say that anybody should be compelled to do anything. But you said they should be sent. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=199.2s)]
*  I said they should be available to them. I didn't say they should be sent. You said that folks that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=205.2s)]
*  take antidepressants are like addicts. I can provide that, Mr. Chair. I think they should have [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=210.32s)]
*  the availability. Listen, I know people, including members of my family, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=216.64s)]
*  who've had a much worse time getting off of SSRIs than they did get, than people have getting off [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  heroin. The withdrawal period is, and it's written on the label. I have some experience with this [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  myself, Mr. Kennedy. This is personal for me. When I was a young woman and I was struggling with [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=235.11999999999998s)]
*  depression, thankfully, I had the resources to help me get through it, including a new generation [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=241.12s)]
*  of SSRI uptake inhibitors, which helped to clear my mind, get me back on track to being a mom and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=249.28s)]
*  a wife and a productive, happy person. I'm really grateful for that therapy. I have some experience [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=255.76s)]
*  with this. I think that everyone should have access to that care. Your job as secretary is to [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=261.2s)]
*  expand access to care, not to spread lies and misinformation. The things that you say, Mr. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=267.91999999999996s)]
*  Kennedy, they live on. They have impact. We're having this conversation at the same moment [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=275.2s)]
*  that my Republican colleagues are looking to try to figure out how to save money any way they can. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=282.64s)]
*  They want to cut Medicaid. Let's just think about this for a minute, because you're going to be, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  should you be confirmed, you would be responsible for CMS, which provides [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=290.96s)]
*  mental and behavioral health care to millions of Americans. Close to 40 percent of folks on [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=295.2s)]
*  Medicaid have a behavioral health condition, and you would be part of this administration [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=300.56s)]
*  that would be looking to cut Medicaid. So, Mr. Kennedy, these statements that you've made linking [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=305.84s)]
*  antidepressants to school shootings, they reinforce the stigma that people who experience [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=312.88s)]
*  mental health every day face every single day. And I'm very concerned that this is another [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=319.52s)]
*  example of your record of sharing false and misleading information that actually really [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=324.96s)]
*  hurts people. Thank you, Mr. Kennedy. Senator, you're mischaracterizing my statements. I am only [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=330.64s)]
*  putting into the record what you have said, Mr. Kennedy. You're mischaracterizing my statements, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=335.68s)]
*  and I'm happy that you had a good experience on SSRIs. Many Americans have a very good experience [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  on it. Others have not. But that would be an issue between them and their physicians, and not for [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=347.92s)]
*  the future head of HHS to be putting out misinformation about the dangers of SSRIs and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  other antidepressant medication spreading the stigma and the fear that we're actually trying [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=360.8s)]
*  to overcome. Do you think physicians, when they make that prescription, ought to have access to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=366.24s)]
*  good science? Of course they do. And that's all I believe, too. And you and I are in agreement, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=371.20000000000005s)]
*  Senator. And to your point that you made when you made these statements, it was not based on [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=375.68s)]
*  good science. I don't know what it was based on. I was saying the science needed to be done. I was [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=380.16s)]
*  saying these are potential culprits. We're coterminous. And I named other things. I said [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=384.08s)]
*  video games. I said social media. I said SSRIs have a black box warning. Warning of suicidal. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=389.2s)]
*  Mr. Chair, I will submit to the Chair the information that I have about what Mr. Kennedy [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=398.16s)]
*  has said of linking antidepressants to school shootings. Thank you. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogXqdk1O_M&t=403.28s)]
