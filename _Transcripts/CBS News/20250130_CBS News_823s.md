*  Major good evening to you [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=145.17999999999998s)]
*  Well to summarize the NTSB has indicated that their investigation will be three things thorough [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=146.7s)]
*  Steady and meticulous. They say that this is the first full day that they are able to get a full grasp on [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=154.01999999999998s)]
*  Exactly what happened last night saying that crews are still in the recovery process [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=161.06s)]
*  Trying to get as many bodies as possible clearly they have been working for hours in this process in this investigation [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=166.86s)]
*  But they say that they are trying to do as much as they can especially before nightfall where they will continue to then [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=175.38s)]
*  Work to try to figure out exactly what happened here [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=181.3s)]
*  Remember there is still wreckage here as well that because of the Potomac is moving down the river as well [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=184.54s)]
*  We've seen some closures at some of the ports along the area as well as crews look to do their work [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=190.74s)]
*  After hearing from the NTSB. They also said that there will be several groups in charge of this investigation everything [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=197.14s)]
*  from structure groups looking to figure out impact angles and pre-impact courses and what the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=204.5s)]
*  Altitude of both those aircraft would exactly be there will also be a systems group looking at air traffic control systems [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=211.26s)]
*  reviewing the radar and also looking about the communications that happened between [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=218.7s)]
*  Air traffic control and the pilots on board those aircraft and also they said that they will be looking at human performance as well [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=223.26s)]
*  That will assess exactly what was going on who said what how they will do [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=230.76s)]
*  everything that they need to in order to get to the bottom of this in the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=236.29999999999998s)]
*  Of this investigation [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=239.74s)]
*  They said that they have yet to find the flight data recorder the NTSB chair indicated that that is still underwater [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=241.74s)]
*  They have also yet to recover the so-called black boxes on either of those aircraft as well [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=248.98000000000002s)]
*  Now one thing that we should point out that earlier today in that White House press briefing [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=254.16000000000003s)]
*  We heard from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth who indicated that a mistake was made last night. Take a listen to this sound [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=259.1s)]
*  Based off of you all's initial [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=266.42s)]
*  Investigations and preliminary findings have you all been able to tell whether this was human error or a mechanical failure? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=269.14000000000004s)]
*  The question was is there been human error or mechanical failure? We don't know what we know just yet [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=274.74s)]
*  We do not know enough facts to be able to rule in or out human factor [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=279.90000000000003s)]
*  Mechanical factors that is part of the NTSB investigative process [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=285.02000000000004s)]
*  Now the NTSB has indicated that they expect at least their preliminary findings to come out within the next 30 days [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=290.36s)]
*  Something else we should point out major is that they say that they are still very much in the briefing [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=297.12s)]

*  Washington DC and Reagan National Airport some of whom have yet to been notified of the fact that their loved ones were on board [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=307.72s)]
*  These aircraft as well they say that they are looking to support them as much as possible [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=314.84s)]
*  There is contact information available [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  therapy hotlines [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=322.4s)]

*  the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=343.88s)]
*  flight of the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  Helicopter and the experience level and the routine or non routine nature of the flight itself [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah major what we're learning first of all is that one of the bodies has been recovered the two other bodies the body of the pilot and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=353.44s)]
*  The co-pilot are still trapped in the helicopter in the Potomac [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=361.44s)]
*  Recovery operations are underway those three soldiers were on an army Blackhawk [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=366.08s)]
*  When it collided last night with the passenger plane this Blackhawk was on a routine [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=371.86s)]
*  training flight [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=377.82s)]
*  Secretary of Defense Pete Hexhast said that it was an annual [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=379.1s)]
*  evaluation of a nighttime flight now what is so [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=383.18s)]
*  Concerning about what happened last night is that we regularly see military helicopters on the Potomac [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=388.7s)]
*  They're flying [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=395.7s)]
*  Nightly daily the route that this helicopter was on last night was described as a fairly easy [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=397.82s)]
*  corridor and [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=404.58s)]
*  Army officials have said that the crew on board that Blackhawk was a very [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=406.26s)]
*  Experienced crew one pilot had a thousand flight hours the other pilot had 500 flight hours, so [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=410.82s)]
*  Secretary of Defense Pete Hexhast says the army is looking into this that this was pretty much routine, but [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=417.9s)]
*  Tragically a mistake happened last night and [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=425.34000000000003s)]
*  Ellie was anything mentioned either by the secretary or other officials at the Pentagon about suspending similar [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=428.46000000000004s)]
*  Helicopter flights in the aftermath of this pending some sort of review or are they going to continue to go on? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=435.54s)]
*  so [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=441.5s)]
*  Secretary of Defense Pete Hexhast said that the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=442.74s)]
*  Battalion that this particular Blackhawk came from the 12th Aviation [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=445.5s)]
*  Battalion out of Fort Belvoir, Virginia will be on a 48-hour pause as this investigation gets going and [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=449.21999999999997s)]
*  The army will certainly look at other [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=456.5s)]
*  Potential safety briefings that they can give about this incident as we learn more [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=460.09999999999997s)]
*  I do want to note I reached out to the army equivalent of the NTSB [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=465.26s)]
*  The NTSB that we've been hearing from all day the army equivalent gave us some stats about aviation [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=470.5s)]
*  mishaps they call mishaps over the past few years and what is [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=477.06s)]
*  Concerning is that fiscal year 2024 so last year was the highest number of [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=483.62s)]
*  aircraft incidents with fatalities since [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=489.86s)]
*  2014 so over a 10-year period last year [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=493.38s)]
*  was the the second highest I I mentioned that not because [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=497.5s)]
*  The not every incident was a Blackhawk, but I mentioned it to to bring up what the army is [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=502.82s)]
*  Concerned about with their safety and training [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=509.62s)]
*  Eleanor Watson at the Pentagon. Thank you very much [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=513.22s)]

*  This is a tragedy for the nation, but it is acutely one for the District of Columbia, Virginia and Maryland [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=520.14s)]
*  You represent Maryland in the Senate first thing [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=526.14s)]
*  I want to ask you is we have confirmed earlier in New York Times reporting that in the control tower last evening [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=528.62s)]
*  One control tower person was tasked with monitoring the movement of helicopters and commercial aviation [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=534.1800000000001s)]
*  Is that concerning to you? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=541.62s)]
*  Well major it's good to be with you. I've seen those [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=544.62s)]
*  Reports and there is a situate situation about the staffing levels not just at Reagan National but [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=547.74s)]
*  FAA staffing levels around the country. So clearly that will be an issue that the NTSB [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=555.18s)]
*  Has to look into [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=561.66s)]
*  What are you most curious about as you evaluate what you have been told by? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=563.5799999999999s)]
*  Aviation officials what you have learned independently and what your constituents are no doubt seeing in [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=569.06s)]
*  Newspaper accounts and on social media. What is most on your mind? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=575.9399999999999s)]
*  Well first as you said this is got a big local impact [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=580.78s)]
*  There are people from around the country who have been who've been killed in this crash including [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=585.38s)]
*  Marylanders and our hearts go out to everybody who lost [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=591.62s)]
*  loved ones [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=595.42s)]
*  People of course have questions something clearly went wrong, right? This was an avoidable accident [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=596.74s)]
*  I do think it's important not to jump to conclusions before the NTSB [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=603.3s)]
*  Does its work and they're beginning to do that as you say you reported they haven't recovered yet the [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=608.82s)]
*  Recorders they haven't worked. We've recovered the flight data [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=615.46s)]
*  But they need to be very transparent about their work and move just as fast as possible to maintain [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=619.3s)]
*  public confidence [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=626.82s)]
*  I'm sure you're aware senator of what President Trump said after offering consoling words for the country. He has [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=628.82s)]
*  Put to questions later acknowledged he had no evidence but nevertheless suggested that somehow [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=635.8199999999999s)]
*  Federal diversity equity and inclusion programs might have been to blame for this [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=642.14s)]
*  your reaction [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=646.9399999999999s)]
*  Major I actually was watching that news [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=648.5s)]
*  Conference and I was absolutely appalled that the president of the United States [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=652.1s)]
*  Would make these reckless [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=657.6999999999999s)]
*  unsubstantiated claims [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=660.74s)]
*  In the middle of this national tragedy to politicize to politicize this national tragedy [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=662.74s)]
*  And I think he owes an apology to every [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=668.62s)]
*  Family who lost loved ones on that airplane [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=672.22s)]
*  I think he owes an apology to the country because he admitted as you said he had no basis [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=674.7s)]
*  For making these claims and he was in the room with the head of the NTSB. That's supposed to be conducting an independent [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=680.82s)]
*  investigation [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=688.86s)]
*  And yet making these reckless grotesque claims I was I was just [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=690.42s)]
*  Appalled that the president would use the moment for political purposes [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=695.26s)]
*  Let's talk about Reagan National as I understand it [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=699.66s)]
*  It had a theoretical capacity of 15 million flights a year [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=702.78s)]
*  The current capacity is about 20 million flights again as I understand it [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=706.8199999999999s)]
*  I may have those numbers wrong feel free to correct me [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=710.14s)]
*  Is it running at a higher capacity than you believe? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=712.7399999999999s)]
*  Is it running at a higher capacity than you believe is [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=716.54s)]
*  Recommended what is your level of concern about what those associated with Reagan National have to do to achieve [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=721.18s)]
*  maximum safety [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=728.7s)]
*  So with respect to this particular collision we obviously have to await the facts [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=731.58s)]
*  But I have had an ongoing concern about the congestion [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=736.5s)]
*  Congestion at Reagan National Airport in fact just last year [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=742.06s)]
*  Senators Kane and Warner from Virginia and myself [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=747.3s)]
*  Opposed the plan to bring more flights [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=751.02s)]
*  Into Reagan National because it is already the most congested airport in the country [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=755.38s)]
*  Right now the amount of time planes have to spend hovering over Reagan National before [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=762.6999999999999s)]
*  Landing is the longest wait time in the country so beyond this particular [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=768.78s)]
*  Collision I do have a concern about the safety issues regarding [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=777.06s)]
*  The congestion and that's why we opposed [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=783.54s)]
*  The idea of bringing even more flights and more planes into this very congested airspace very quickly senator [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=786.54s)]
*  Do you think that decision to bring more planes in will be now revisited? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=793.8199999999999s)]
*  I [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=798.2199999999999s)]
*  Think that we need to take another look at all these safety issues [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=799.14s)]
*  You know whether or not that's the cause of this particular collision. That's up to the NTSB [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=803.06s)]
*  But hopefully this will remind everybody that our number one priority [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=807.3s)]
*  Has to be the safety of the flying public and we should look at everything in the context of this terrible tragedy [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=812.26s)]
*  Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen. Thank you very much. Thank you [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPt91dLU0NA&t=818.66s)]
