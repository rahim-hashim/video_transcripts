# Atmospheric river threatens parts of California scorched by wildfires
**CBS News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw)
*  Turning our monitors now to Los Angeles County in California, where people living in areas [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=0.0s)]
*  that were ravaged by wildfires are being told once again to evacuate, this time for a completely [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=5.04s)]
*  different reason. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=11.620000000000001s)]
*  Rain is pouring down and it could trigger life threatening mudslides and debris flows. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=13.34s)]
*  City crews have installed concrete barriers and sandbags to stop mud flows. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=20.0s)]
*  The fire department has pre-positioned swift water rescue and urban search and rescue teams, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=25.52s)]
*  bulldozers and other resources. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=31.88s)]
*  DWP crews are activated to respond to power outages and LAPD officers are checking on [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=34.04s)]
*  critical infrastructure and are ready to facilitate evacuations. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=40.72s)]
*  We are staying on top of the storm here in the Emergency Operations Center and with crews [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=45.56s)]
*  deployed citywide, we ask Angelenos to stay vigilant also. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=50.64s)]
*  All right, let's get right to CBS News correspondent Carter Evans. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=55.88s)]
*  He is live in the Pacific Palisades. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=58.96s)]
*  Carter, thank you for being with us. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  What more can you tell us about those evacuation orders? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=62.440000000000005s)]
*  So people are being told to stay away and for good reason. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=67.04s)]
*  Let me give you an example of what they're concerned about. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=70.04s)]
*  If you look over to my left here, you can see this burned out hillside and there are [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=72.76s)]
*  actually still some trees left on this hillside and that's better condition than most. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=76.92s)]
*  But you see all that dirt there? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=82.12s)]
*  It doesn't take much to make that slide down. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=84.44s)]
*  And as we pan back over here, you're going to see on my other side, there's a church [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=86.64s)]
*  right there. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=90.64s)]
*  And so this is what it's like all over the Palisades, homes nestled in these little canyon [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=91.64s)]
*  areas and for the most part, the vegetation has just been vaporized. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=96.92s)]
*  So there is literally nothing to hold the dirt onto the hillside. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=101.36s)]
*  And if we get rain rates of about a half inch an hour, that's what it takes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=106.0s)]
*  That can and will cause mudslides. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=110.2s)]
*  So I believe that it is highly likely that we will see some sort of mudslide or debris [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=112.42s)]
*  flow this afternoon in the L.A. County area in the burn scars. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=116.72s)]
*  Oh, that area just cannot get a break, Carter. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=121.04s)]
*  So how did emergency crews and people who live in these areas prepare for these kinds [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=124.3s)]
*  of storms? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=128.96s)]
*  I mean, so many of them are still cleaning up from the fires. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=129.96s)]
*  Yeah, and the cleanup has really just begun. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=134.2s)]
*  There's not a whole lot you can do to prepare in certain areas that they do expect mudflows [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=136.88s)]
*  to occur. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=142.2s)]
*  They put concrete barriers up to kind of direct the flow hopefully around. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=143.2s)]
*  But you know, as we've seen in other mudslide areas after big fires, like for example, that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  Montecito mudslide that killed 23 people after the Thomas fire. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, these things can essentially come out of nowhere. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=156.67999999999998s)]
*  They happen very, very quickly when you get heavy rainfall and you get that heavy rainfall [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=160.04s)]
*  up high in the mountains and it just starts rolling and picking up steam and grabbing [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  everything in its path down the mountain, bringing it along with it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=169.12s)]
*  And there's no way to stop it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=172.44s)]
*  That's what's so scary. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=173.68s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit more about the wildfire recovery effort. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=175.2s)]
*  There has been recent developments as far as soil testing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=178.64s)]
*  What can you tell us about that? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=181.84s)]
*  So there are some people that are concerned that the Army Corps of Engineers is not going [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=185.1s)]
*  to be testing the soil after they scrape six inches off. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=188.68s)]
*  What they're saying is we're going to go in and we're going to clear your property and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=191.8s)]
*  in the burn footprint, we're going to scrape six inches of soil because their research [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=194.88s)]
*  has shown that that's how far those toxins will generally leach into the ground. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=199.34s)]
*  And some homeowners are saying, well, we want tests to be sure that it's safe. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=204.68s)]
*  And you know, I live in the area and I get it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  I've actually paid myself to have someone come out to my home and test the soot inside [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=212.36s)]
*  so we can tell what's in there. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=216.44s)]
*  So I think a lot of homeowners are going to be doing that on their own, testing the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=218.12s)]
*  soil, making sure it's completely safe before they start the expensive process of rebuilding. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  It is a process. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  No question. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=227.72s)]
*  Carter Evans, thank you so much for that report. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=228.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=230.28s)]
*  I want to bring in Jess now. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=231.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=232.28s)]
*  Where is a storm now and how long is this thing going to last? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=233.28s)]
*  You know, this atmospheric river, it's stretching from the Bay Area up in San Francisco all the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  way down into Los Angeles with it bringing about six inches of rain at max. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=238.96s)]
*  And it's happening in live time right now as we speak. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=243.12s)]
*  You know, he mentioned the rainfall rates. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=245.56s)]
*  If we continue to see that consistency, it's inevitable that we could potentially see those [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  mudslides and it causes a lot of issues for our friends and our families down there right [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=251.48s)]
*  now. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=255.64s)]
*  So I'm going to head over to the map real fast. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=256.64s)]
*  I want to show you where that atmospheric river is that for those who aren't really [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=257.64s)]
*  familiar with this, California, the Pacific Northwest during this time of year, it's normal [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  to see strong storms come in from the Gulf of Alaska sometimes. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=265.86s)]
*  But when we pick up that tropical moisture from the south and it pulls in those atmospheric [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=269.82s)]
*  It causes a lot of catastrophe for all that west coastline. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=273.88s)]
*  And we're seeing that right now. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  This time loop goes throughout the next 48 hours as it pushes its way over into the Rockies. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=279.0s)]
*  With that, it's going to bring plenty of snow to the Rockies and all the way over into communities [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=283.12s)]
*  like the Tahoe region. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=288.44s)]
*  But let's fix it real fast on our coastline. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=289.8s)]
*  Areas like San Francisco currently dealing with some really heavy rain and winds, wind [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=293.04s)]
*  gusts anywhere up to around 80 miles per hour are forecast along that shoreline. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=296.52s)]
*  You head down south, they're experiencing the exact same setup and off into the Sierra. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=300.4s)]
*  Winter storm warnings are in effect right now causing issues out there on the roads. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=304.56s)]
*  And it's just inconvenient across the board throughout the state of California as they're [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  dealing with this rain and it's even catastrophic in a lot of ways too. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=312.48s)]
*  We take a look at those flood watches in Southern California and it's important to note in these [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=316.38s)]
*  burn scar areas, we keep a very close eye on it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=319.6s)]
*  As of now, there's flood watches as well as flash flood watches widespread throughout these [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=322.48s)]
*  areas. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=326.8s)]
*  This map will actually update in live time if we see any red dots or any red zones or [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=327.8s)]
*  counties on this map. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  It'll tell us when those flood warnings go into effect. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=334.44s)]
*  That's when those community members get notified and we continue to keep a close eye on that [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=336.8s)]
*  as this rain continues to fall and the winds start to kick up. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=340.36s)]
*  So here's where the rain is at just within the next 24 hours or so. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=343.92s)]
*  We're expected to see about four to eight inches locally in areas throughout the north [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=347.44s)]
*  coast. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=351.0s)]
*  You head all the way down into Southern California. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=352.0s)]
*  Keep in mind these communities. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=354.54s)]
*  We talked about it just after the Palisades fire happened. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=355.8s)]
*  They haven't seen rain in eight, nine months in some of these areas and now we're starting [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=358.72s)]
*  to see these atmospheric rivers really dump heavy rain. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=363.72s)]
*  Anywhere up to around six inches expected and then you head up into the Sierra Tahoe [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=366.24s)]
*  area, we're talking about close to 50 inches of snow just within the next 48 hours. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=369.6s)]
*  So lots is happening right now but we'll continue to monitor it closely, Liz. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=374.5s)]
*  It's really scary because that soiled Southern California from that Wells fire is so unstable [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=378.08000000000004s)]
*  and so just a little bit of rain could cause disaster. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=383.67999999999995s)]
*  Carter made a good point. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=386.08s)]
*  This is a friendly reminder too for those community members to check their soil as well [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=387.08s)]
*  since of course that's not happening elsewhere. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=390.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=392.84s)]
*  That's one more thing they've got to think about and also the cleanup as well. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=393.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=396.59999999999997s)]
*  Alright Jess, thanks so much. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0L-EWIfRBw&t=397.59999999999997s)]
