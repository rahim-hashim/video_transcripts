# Voters react to mass layoffs at federal agencies
**CBS News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM)
*  CBS News has learned the Office of Personnel Management has given federal agencies until [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=0.0s)]
*  tonight to issue layoffs in the Trump administration's efforts to downsize. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=4.54s)]
*  Earlier today, I spoke with Natalie Brand about how people affected by these widespread [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=8.88s)]
*  cuts across the government feel. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=13.44s)]
*  I traveled to Ashburn, Virginia, about 40 minutes outside of Washington, D.C., as you [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=16.0s)]
*  know. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=21.2s)]
*  This is an area where you will find a variety of political views, but also an area that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=22.2s)]
*  is heavily dependent on the federal government. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=28.16s)]
*  You have federal employees there, as well as government contractors, people who work [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=30.92s)]
*  for businesses that support the federal government. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=36.16s)]
*  So I talked to more than a dozen people. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  Many of them didn't want to go on camera, but some of them did go on camera and shared [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=42.72s)]
*  their opinions, ranging from fear to some applauding what is going on right now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=48.8s)]
*  One of the women I met, her name is Carol. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=56.34s)]
*  She says her husband works for a company that's heavily dependent on contracts from USAID. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=59.1s)]
*  So over the past few weeks, all of his projects have been shut down, and she said that his [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=67.86s)]
*  company has had to furlough around 70 percent of its staff. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=73.56s)]
*  She and her friend Janet spoke to us about some of their concerns. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=78.82000000000001s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=83.86s)]
*  Carol and Janet. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=84.86s)]
*  Everything just feels very indiscriminately done. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=87.3s)]
*  There's no purpose to it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=90.14s)]
*  They're just slashing people without any kind of thoughtful consideration of what they do, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=92.98s)]
*  what their job is. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=99.34s)]
*  I just don't understand how all this can happen, and there's no control over it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=100.5s)]
*  And we've got people in the Oval Office now that aren't politicians that have no right [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=105.82s)]
*  to be making these decisions. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=112.02000000000001s)]
*  And now the White House has said that Doge, the Department of Government Efficiency, and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=116.58s)]
*  Elon Musk are simply advising these federal agencies, but ultimately it's up to the agency [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=121.54s)]
*  heads, the secretaries, to make the final decisions on cuts, who's getting fired or [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=127.14s)]
*  hired. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=134.5s)]
*  As for supporters of President Trump, I spoke to a number of them as well. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=135.82s)]
*  While they say that this is long overdue, that they like downsizing federal government, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=141.7s)]
*  one Trump supporter did tell me he feels like the cuts so far have been made too abruptly. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=147.78s)]
*  I think it was a little quick. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=155.02s)]
*  I think he probably could have rolled it out a little better. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=156.5s)]
*  But I think overall it's going to be good in the long run. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=159.66s)]
*  I don't think it's too abrupt. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=164.46s)]
*  Unfortunately, we do have to pull the rug out after a while. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=166.42000000000002s)]
*  I mean, the spigot has got to stop. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=169.02s)]
*  This has just been ridiculous. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=171.34s)]
*  Now, while in Ashburn, Loudoun County, I also met a government employee who didn't want [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=173.42000000000002s)]
*  to go on camera, but he described these cuts as, quote, fantastic. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=181.98000000000002s)]
*  I spoke to someone else who couldn't go on camera. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=186.86s)]
*  He had the opposite viewpoint. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=189.78s)]
*  And he worries that the cuts of probationary employees, the workers who have perhaps less [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  than two years of experience on the job, that that will drive out a lot of young, high-skilled [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=198.26s)]
*  talent, forcing them out of government and taking their skills with them, major. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=204.78s)]
*  And Natalie, I'm fascinated by the conversations you had because they reflect another layer [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=210.7s)]
*  of this story. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=214.98s)]
*  The first layer, the one everyone's been most focused upon, understandably, is those directly [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=216.57999999999998s)]
*  impacted by layoff notices. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=221.38s)]
*  But as you talk to people, there are those downstream who are part of businesses that [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=223.62s)]
*  support those people who are employed, who are also beginning to feel the echoing effects [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=227.82s)]
*  of these layoffs. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=232.74s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=233.74s)]
*  And right now, everyone's kind of on pause and wondering what will happen next, especially [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=234.74s)]
*  as these various legal cases, court cases continue to play out. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=241.26s)]
*  And another gentleman I spoke to, he was also connected to work with the federal government. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=246.54s)]
*  He said he was an IT consultant. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=252.7s)]
*  He worries about the economic impact in places like Northern Virginia, where there is such [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=254.98s)]
*  a heavy presence of government workers and those connected to the federal government. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=261.46s)]
*  Natalie Brand, excellent reporting. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=266.26s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb-xvlBqtM&t=267.9s)]
