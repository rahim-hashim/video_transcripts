# NTSB officials give an update on the deadly D.C. plane and Black Hawk helicopter collision
**CBS News:** [February 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U)
*  Hello everyone. I'm Nancy Chen. NTSB officials are providing an update on Wednesday night's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=0.0s)]
*  American Airlines deadly plane crash with a Blackhawk helicopter. Let's watch. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  Another set of individuals due to the Philadelphia crash. Our hearts go out to all of them. Nobody [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=15.68s)]
*  should suffer this much tragedy no matter what time frame in between it. But know this, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=23.28s)]
*  we will find out what happened in both of those accidents. We will make recommendations. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=30.6s)]
*  We will attempt to never have to deal with those type of accidents again. I want to give [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=37.04s)]
*  you just a couple of facts right off the bat just in case there's any questions. Last year, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=42.08s)]
*  NTSB investigated across all modes 1288 different events. Aviation accounted for 1204 of those. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=48.28s)]
*  We currently have open 1145 investigations in aviation. Last year we had multiple accidents [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=60.56s)]
*  with six or more fatalities. Across all of our modes, which are primarily aviation, we dealt with [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=69.96s)]
*  343 fatalities. We currently have open 1100 recommendations and in aviation there are 283 [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=78.39999999999999s)]
*  that are still pending. The team that is working on this crash at DCA collectively has over 350 [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  years of tenuity with the NTSB. We will find out what happened and we will do everything we can to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=97.24s)]
*  prevent it. But I don't want anyone to think because we are working two accidents. This is [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  what we do. Week in and week out. Just today a lot more people are paying attention to it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=110.56s)]
*  I want to take an opportunity to introduce Bryce Banning. He hasn't really spoken the last couple [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  of times but he's been working hard and putting together a lot of information. Bryce joined the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=124.12s)]
*  NTSB in 2012 as a senior aircraft investigator. He's been the investigator in charge on hundreds [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=129.36s)]
*  of aircraft investigations. He's an airline transport pilot with commercial privileges for [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  single engine land and sea, certified flight instructor, multi-engine instructor, and instrument [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=143.16s)]
*  instructor. He's also a certified airframe and power plant mechanic. Bryce has accumulated over [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=149.95999999999998s)]
*  8,000 hours of flight time in all types of aircraft ranging from Piper's to Navajos, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=157.56s)]
*  King Airs, and Lear. He served in multiple management positions for multiple airlines [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=162.28s)]
*  and he has been leading this team since the inception. He's going to brief you on some [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=167.92s)]
*  details that we have and then we'll come back with some additional details. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=172.52s)]
*  Thank you. The flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder from the PSA aircraft [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  were recovered on Thursday in the late afternoon by the FBI dive team. The CVR and the FDR were [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=189.4s)]
*  provided to engineers at the NTSB vehicle recorders division immediately after recovery. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=197.48s)]
*  Both the FDR and the CVR were a L3 Harris communications, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=205.72s)]
*  FA 2100 type. Both recorders are solid state memory digital recorders. Both the CVR and the FDR were [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=213.0s)]
*  downloaded successfully. The FDR contains about 400 parameters and is currently being analyzed [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=226.12s)]
*  by a FDR working group consisting of the NTSB, FAA, and PSA. The CVR contained about two hours [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=235.88s)]
*  and four minutes of good quality audio. ADS-B and FDR time were correlated. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=248.6s)]
*  Timing will continue to be refined. Times are in Eastern Standard Time and are preliminary. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=259.64s)]
*  The FDR captures the entirety of the accident flight. The CVR audio, because it is only two [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=267.96s)]
*  hours in duration, starts mid-flight. Prior to initial descent, the crew briefed the arrival [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=276.6s)]
*  for the troops five arrival followed by an ILS approach to runway one at DCA. Around 8 15, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=286.44s)]
*  the aircraft left 37,000 feet for an initial descent. At 8 39 10, Potomac approach cleared the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=297.8s)]
*  crew for the Mount Vernon visual runway one approach. At 8 43 06, the crew made initial [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=309.40000000000003s)]
*  contact with the DCA tower. The tower controller then asked if the crew could switch to runway [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=320.68s)]
*  three three. After a brief discussion between the crew, they agreed to runway three three. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=328.76s)]
*  At 8 45 27, the autopilot was disconnected. At 8 46 01, a radio transmission from the tower was [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=337.24s)]
*  audible informing Pat 25 that traffic just south of the Wilson Bridge was a CRJ at 1,200 feet [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=349.24s)]
*  circling to runway three three. At 8 46 29, the crew received a 1,000 foot automated call out. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=361.32s)]
*  At 8 46 47, DCA tower cleared other jet traffic on runway one for departure with no delay. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=372.59999999999997s)]
*  At 8 47 29, the crew received a 500 foot automated call out. At 8 47 39, a radio transmission from the tower [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  was audible asking Pat 25 if the CRJ was in sight. One second later, the crew received an automatic [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=397.15999999999997s)]
*  automated traffic advisory stating traffic traffic. At 8 47 42, a radio transmission from the tower was [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=408.6s)]
*  audible directing Pat 25 to pass behind the CRJ. At 8 47 58, the crew had a verbal reaction [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=414.84000000000003s)]
*  and FDR data showed the airplane beginning to increase its pitch. Sounds of impact were audible [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=424.2s)]
*  about one second later followed by the end of the recording. At 8 47 50, the crew received a [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=431.32s)]
*  recorded FDR data showing the airplane beginning to increase its pitch. Sounds of impact were audible about one second later followed by the end of the recording. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=440.52s)]
*  A CVR group consisting of party representatives from the NTSB, PSA, ALPA, and the FAA has been convened. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=454.35999999999996s)]
*  The group is currently working to transcribe the entirety of the CVR recording verbatim. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=466.12s)]
*  We will take some questions at the end but we have some additional details we definitely want to brief [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=479.8s)]
*  you on today. I want to clarify something that was I think presented by NTSB in some form [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=483.56s)]
*  specifically around air traffic control. The Washington DCA tower was communicating out [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=489.4s)]
*  any transmission on a VHF and UHF frequency. They would any transmission would come out on both bands. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=496.67999999999995s)]
*  The Black Hawk was transmitting out with a UHF band while the CRJ jet was transmitting out with a VHF. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=506.2s)]
*  To put that in context, both the airplane and the helicopter would hear any air traffic control [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=518.0400000000001s)]
*  but they would not hear the other aircraft or helicopter conversely if they were transmitting out. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=525.1600000000001s)]
*  I bring that up because we are now working through the transcript of the air traffic control [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=533.48s)]
*  and many people have heard online different recordings. Those do not contain [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=538.36s)]
*  the UHF radio transmissions. What they are hearing is the VHF recorded on certain software programs. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=546.2s)]
*  As we synchronize the timing on that, we hope to be able to release it tomorrow. We do have it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=555.72s)]
*  We are working through the synchronization because the specific time will be very critical. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=561.0s)]
*  A few updates in regard to the Black Hawk helicopter. We can verify it was on a training flight [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=567.08s)]
*  that would utilize night vision goggles. We do not know at this time if the night vision goggles [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=574.4399999999999s)]
*  were actively being worn nor what the setting may be. Further investigation should be able to let [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=581.24s)]
*  us know if that occurred and what factor it may play in the overall accident. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=587.9599999999999s)]
*  We do know that the and we announced the combination CVR and the flight data recorder [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=595.4799999999999s)]
*  was extracted last night from the aircraft. When it was brought to our lab and opened, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=602.84s)]
*  there was a water intrusion. Again, this is not uncommon. If you recall in the CRJ, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=609.96s)]
*  that cockpit voice recorder also had a water intrusion. It is going through the same process [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=617.1600000000001s)]
*  of eye to eye water until it's put into a vacuum oven. We still are very confident we will have [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=623.08s)]
*  that data. On the Black Hawk, we can confirm that we are looking into a priority air transport and [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=628.84s)]
*  that's where you hear PAT, that on the prior day, PAT 11 was in close contact with a Republic air [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=639.72s)]
*  flight. The Republic air flight rejected the landing and did a go around. The reason we are [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=651.08s)]
*  bringing this up is our data currently shows there was over 1,000 feet of separation between [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=657.0s)]
*  those two aircraft. 1,000 feet is a good safety barrier. Obviously, the pilot made its own decision [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=664.6s)]
*  in rejecting the landing. We just wanted to bring that fact out. It will be considered in the overall [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=671.96s)]
*  evaluation of this accident. So now let's go into controllers. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=677.4s)]
*  At the time of the accident, there were five controllers in the air traffic control tower cab [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=696.04s)]
*  at DCA. One was a local controller which was handling not only helicopter [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=702.6s)]
*  but fixed wing aircraft. Another, and the local controller also would be handling arrivals and [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=710.2s)]
*  departures, close in airspace and the use of the runway. There was a ground controller which was [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=717.08s)]
*  handling all aircraft and vehicles, not on the runway. In addition, there was a local assist [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=724.0400000000001s)]
*  controller. This person is responsible for assisting the local controller in any type of [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=731.72s)]
*  actions that are needed, reviewing data, scanning the field, a multitude of different things. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=738.36s)]
*  You will not hear the assistant controller on any of the ATC's tapes but we can confirm that person [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=745.0s)]
*  was in the cab. In addition, there's an operation supervisor who has direct oversight over the tower. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=750.36s)]
*  This is someone who manages everyone that's involved in the operation along with an operational [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=759.1600000000001s)]
*  supervisor in training. That leads us to confirm there were five people in the tower at the time of [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=764.5200000000001s)]
*  the accident. At this time, we have interviewed the local controller, the ground controller, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=772.5200000000001s)]
*  and the local assist controller. We anticipate having the interviews with the operation supervisor [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=780.5200000000001s)]
*  and the supervisor in training conducted no later than Monday evening. And for a little bit of [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=788.12s)]
*  context, this is a controller's worst nightmare. It hits everyone that works in that cab and knows [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=795.24s)]
*  them very hard. These interviews take a long time, not because there's that much talking, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=803.5600000000001s)]
*  but there's several breaks that occur for emotions just to be able to compose themselves to talk about [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=809.88s)]
*  what happened. We want to be thorough. If we need to go back for additional information, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=816.44s)]
*  we absolutely will. We're getting full cooperation and access to those individuals we need, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=821.08s)]
*  and we hope again to have them completed no later than Monday. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=827.1600000000001s)]
*  Now we're going to talk a little bit about altitude and I'm going to preface this. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=834.12s)]
*  And we're going to try to work with your questions, but I want to be very clear. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=839.4000000000001s)]
*  Our team has had some internal debate on releasing one part of this, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=842.6s)]
*  and whenever I explain it, I hope you will understand why. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=849.48s)]
*  When we received the recorders from the CRJ, we were able to define an altitude of where it was [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=853.8000000000001s)]
*  very close to the time of impact. That is a data point we feel very comfortable with. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=861.96s)]
*  We also have an initial set of information in regard to what was being seen on the cab [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=868.52s)]
*  in the control tower. We have not finalized that and need to get more granularity to it, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=875.8s)]
*  and we currently don't have the readout from the Blackhawk. I put all that into context for you [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=883.08s)]
*  in that whenever I give you some altitude information, one part of the three pieces, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=889.96s)]
*  pieces we have defined. The other, another part we feel fairly confident, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=895.56s)]
*  but need to get more information, and a third we don't even have. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=902.8399999999999s)]
*  Currently, the CRJ, based upon the data recorder, at the time of impact was at 325 feet, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=908.92s)]
*  plus or minus 25 feet. This is from the belly of the CRJ. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=918.28s)]
*  The CRJ itself is 20 feet and 8 inches from the wheel to the top of the tail. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=927.24s)]
*  So from the belly, the CRJ at time of impact was 325, less or minus 25 degrees, and for those who [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=934.4399999999999s)]
*  follow this closely, that is a corrected altitude. It is based on the ADSB data and the flight data [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=943.48s)]
*  recorder. Our preliminary review of what the tower cab was showing on the data screen that would have [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=950.84s)]
*  been in front of the controllers was 200 feet near the time of the accident. Again, this data [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=959.48s)]
*  is preliminary. Tomorrow, we feel very comfortable that we'll be getting the additional data sources [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=969.08s)]
*  that will confirm precisely what it would have been on the screen at the time. And I would also [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=976.44s)]
*  caution you, there's typically in the cab on that screen, it may be a four to five second refresh rate, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=983.08s)]
*  but obviously this is something that we're going to be looking at very closely. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=990.6800000000001s)]
*  The third prong of that is the helicopter recorders. Between those three, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=994.68s)]
*  whenever we have those data points finalized, we feel that we'll be very comfortable in saying [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1002.1999999999999s)]
*  exactly what altitude this occurred at. And I know that's been a lot of speculation. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1008.1999999999999s)]
*  You may have a few questions on it, but I want to caution. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1012.92s)]
*  We're trying to give you what information we have and we verified at that time. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1017.3199999999999s)]
*  With that, we'll take some questions. Just one second. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1024.6s)]
*  Ma'am. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1033.32s)]
*  The question was the altitude that was read from the ABSB and the voice recorder was trying to pull [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1046.92s)]
*  up. I can tell you at one point very close to the impact, there was a slight change in pitch, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1053.4s)]
*  an increase in pitch. That is something that we will get you more detail on, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1061.0800000000002s)]
*  but it was an indication of an increase in pitch. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1066.52s)]
*  Thank you, Todd. Grady, Triple-Wing Fox. So are you also saying that there was a 100-foot discrepancy [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1071.72s)]
*  between what the air traffic controller was seeing on the screen in front of them and what the [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1078.6s)]
*  the height, the altitude of the plane, there's a 100-feet difference? So the question is, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1084.76s)]
*  was there a 100-feet difference between what we found the plane to be operating at and the air [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1090.04s)]
*  traffic control tower? I'm saying the initial data we have on the control tower cab says 200 feet [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1095.0s)]
*  would have been visualized. This is a fairly good estimate, but it needs to be finalized. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1102.04s)]
*  I shouldn't say estimate. It's a fairly good initial read. It needs to be finalized. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1108.44s)]
*  And again, the CRJ was operating at 325 feet plus or minus 25. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1114.76s)]
*  And how common is it that the two aircraft would be operating on different frequencies with the same [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1122.36s)]
*  control tower? The question is how common would it be that the two aircraft would be operating on [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1128.76s)]
*  separate frequencies? It is completely common. A military operates on one frequency, civilian on [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1133.8s)]
*  another. We're just trying to clarify that because you're only reading some or hearing some things [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1139.32s)]
*  online, so we're trying to get out and dispel some myths. Yes, sir? Mr. Edmund Dingelal with [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1145.1599999999999s)]
*  DC News now at this point, you've given us the CRJ, but can you speculate on the altitude of [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1150.6s)]
*  the PAT at this point? We cannot speculate. The question is, can we give any information on the [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1159.8799999999999s)]
*  altitude of the PAT? We cannot at this point. Obviously, an impact occurred, and I would say [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1165.48s)]
*  when an impact occurs, that is typically where the altitude of both aircraft were at the moment. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1174.04s)]
*  But again, whenever we have the data from the reporter, we will be able to give you more [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1181.24s)]
*  specific. And just to follow up, if I may, sir, there have been reports, can you comment on reports [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1187.0s)]
*  that PAT may have flown above its max limit in that airspace? So the question was, can I comment [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1193.8s)]
*  on reports that PAT may have flown above its max limits? No, because I haven't heard that, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1202.52s)]
*  and I don't try to look at the media that much. So by not saying that, I'm not denying, but I just [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1210.0400000000002s)]
*  haven't heard it. We haven't discussed it. I'll ask the investigator in charge, do you have any [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1214.92s)]
*  information on that? Yeah, I can provide just a little bit of context. The PAT-25 was within [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1219.16s)]
*  the lateral boundaries of a helicopter route. The ceiling of that route was 200 feet. As Member [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1229.32s)]
*  Inman said, we have not got the data out of the FDR for the Blackhawk at this time, but that's what we know. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1239.56s)]
*  Okay, we're gonna go down here. David Kaplan with Box 5 here in D.C. You mentioned as you walked [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1250.2s)]
*  through the timeline that there was a broadcast over the cockpit of traffic, traffic, traffic. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1256.2s)]
*  Can you talk about what indications, if any, you have that the plane's anti-collision system was [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1262.68s)]
*  working? It's my understanding that that broadcast goes out if the system has been activated. Can [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1269.0s)]
*  you comment on what you've learned about the anti-collision system? The question is about the [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1275.16s)]
*  traffic, traffic, traffic that was heard on the cockpit for a supporter. I can say this, we're defining [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1279.32s)]
*  what is inside of each system and what was there outputting. Because of the unique nature of [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1285.64s)]
*  military aircraft, we need additional specialization, which we have, but for right now we're trying to [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1291.48s)]
*  present you with what we've heard. So we need further information to be able to find why it [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1297.48s)]
*  was indicating traffic, traffic, traffic. Yes? The night goggles. How will you determine if they were [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1302.1200000000001s)]
*  wearing the night goggles or not? The question was how will we determine if they were wearing the night [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1308.92s)]
*  vision goggles or not? Part of that will be based, and we already know during the extraction of the [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1314.28s)]
*  bodies, how they were presented and what was around them. I can say that impact was very significant [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1321.08s)]
*  and so it will take additional analysis of their helmets, the attached areas. We're looking to find [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1331.48s)]
*  if the night vision goggle bags whenever we extract the aircraft. Are they empty? Are they [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1337.8799999999999s)]
*  found in the debris field? There's a lot of different variables we need to find out before [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1342.28s)]
*  we determine that. Yes? Okay, so the question was in regard to it, the term you used was runway switch [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1346.12s)]
*  and we briefed this yesterday. The CRJ was on approach to runway 33. They'd been brought in [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1370.44s)]
*  that way. As they were coming in, they were asked by the air traffic control, could they accept, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1377.56s)]
*  or sorry, let me reverse that. They were coming in on runway one. As they were on approach, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1382.92s)]
*  the air traffic controller said can you accept runway 33? That is not an uncommon occurrence at [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1388.44s)]
*  DCA. It creates an arcing of the flight path, so it's very normal. Pilots were actually able to [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1393.72s)]
*  discuss it. They accepted it. They appeared to be on a proper at least lineup at that time. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1403.56s)]
*  So right now we're evaluating with all the other facts and data, but it is what it is at this point, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1409.72s)]
*  I guess. Yes, sir. The question was the staffing at the time of the actual accident with the five [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1416.52s)]
*  individuals. I have not gotten an update from the air traffic control people. I know the primary [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1434.28s)]
*  thing we wanted to get was exactly that. And there's been discussions because again, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1439.56s)]
*  typical can change based on the day of the week, the time, the weather. So we will not [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1444.44s)]
*  categorize anything as typical right now until we can present it in a better fashion. Yes, sir. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1450.6s)]
*  The question was what was it was reading the airplane. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1455.3200000000002s)]
*  It could not read the helicopter. It could read the helicopter. And the reason why I'm saying it [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1475.64s)]
*  could, and this is again getting into more specific information, the definition that's needed [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1481.8s)]
*  for us to evaluate that further will be downloaded tomorrow. Do you want to answer a little bit on [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1488.6s)]
*  how those control towers, or I'm happy to continue. Okay. Those monitors obviously assimilate different [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1493.08s)]
*  pieces of information. So our initial read was showing that we're giving you the 200 feet as [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1501.3999999999999s)]
*  indicative of the CRJ. I don't want to speculate specifically on the Blackhawk. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1507.48s)]
*  Sorry, it's reverse right. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1515.4s)]
*  So as Crevely stated, we know that the FDR and data provided indicated that the CRJ [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1522.76s)]
*  was at 325 feet plus or minus 25 feet. We also initial preliminary data right now indicates [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1533.8s)]
*  that on the tower's radar scope that was available to the controller, initial data indicates that [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1545.1599999999999s)]
*  that would indicates that he may have seen 200 feet. That needs to be verified. Our ATC group [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1555.08s)]
*  is working it. We will have more data available, but those are the initial indications. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1562.52s)]
*  The data that I'm talking about, the 200 foot data that would have been available on that radar scope, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1572.84s)]
*  that was the Blackhawk. The 325 foot that we've given you is ADSB data, FDR data, other data [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1580.12s)]
*  combined to get an accurate altitude of the CRJ, 325 plus or minus 25. The radar data where that [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1589.88s)]
*  helicopter is down at 200 feet, it has less fidelity. So our team is looking into that, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1600.44s)]
*  but I think it's important to note that this is a complex investigation. There's a lot of pieces [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1610.2800000000002s)]
*  here. Our team is working very hard to gather this data, make sure we, as member Inman has said, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1618.6s)]
*  understand why this happened. Sorry, Bryce. Hang on, I'll call on people. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1626.6s)]
*  This man. What your colleague just said that the CRJ was showing at 375 feet, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1634.84s)]
*  your Blackhawk was showing at 200. So the question again, and I'm going to try to say this one more [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1640.28s)]
*  time, the CRJ at the time of impact based on ADSB data and the data in the flight reporter [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1645.8s)]
*  shows that that airplane was positioned at 325 feet plus or minus 25 feet. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1658.04s)]
*  On the radar scope in the cab, our preliminary review shows that the Blackhawk helicopter [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1665.56s)]
*  would have visualized at 200 feet. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1673.24s)]
*  It's not as defined, that is preliminary. We will get more significant information. We wanted to [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1679.0s)]
*  present the 325 plus or minus because we knew that, we have good certainty with it, but without [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1684.4399999999998s)]
*  presenting it with the radar scope information or with presenting that, it could cause some conflict. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1690.9199999999998s)]
*  So I'm going to be very careful to make sure we still have a lot more work to do. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1696.4399999999998s)]
*  These are one of thousands of data points and will be hundreds of thousands of pages. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1701.8000000000002s)]
*  We're trying to release the information as we know it and make sure we're [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1706.6000000000001s)]
*  giving the best information that's accurate and learning from it. Yep. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1711.0800000000002s)]
*  Chairman, yesterday you talked about spending time with some of the victim's families. Can you describe [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1716.44s)]
*  any update today? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1721.4s)]
*  Questions about spending time with the member's families? Yeah, I spent several hours with them [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1726.6000000000001s)]
*  today. There's more, some new, there's some that have been there for three days, some that want to [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1731.32s)]
*  give us hugs, some that are just mad and angry. They're just all hurt and they still want answers [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1739.32s)]
*  and we want to give them answers. The most devastating thing I guess today was [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1746.28s)]
*  they watched the news last night. They know their loved ones are recovering. They're thinking, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1752.4399999999998s)]
*  is it going to take longer? Am I not going to be finding my loved one? How will this affect it? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1759.08s)]
*  That's hard. I mean it's horrible. It's horrible and no one would have to suffer this. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1763.08s)]
*  So yeah, it is hard on them. They have a lot of questions. They haven't been through this. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1769.24s)]
*  Unfortunately, we have a lot of experts. We've done a thousand. That doesn't mean it's not [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1774.6799999999998s)]
*  completely new to them. What's really horrible though is that these things are happening. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1778.4399999999998s)]
*  You know, I keep a challenge coin. When I first got to the NTSB, they asked, you know, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1785.3999999999999s)]
*  it's a challenge coin you hand to people. Does it sign of gratitude and respect? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1792.6s)]
*  Front of it has the seal name. I said, what do you want to put on the back? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1796.52s)]
*  This was on the front door of our training center where the TW 800 was for many years. From tragedy, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1801.7199999999998s)]
*  we draw knowledge to improve the safety for us all. That's what we're doing right now. We're [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1808.28s)]
*  dealing with tragedy, but we need to improve safety. We need 200 plus recommendations fixed. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1814.36s)]
*  We need people to take action. Unfortunately, at some point, all of you are going to be gone. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1819.48s)]
*  We're still going to have the investigation open. We're going to make recommendations. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1825.24s)]
*  We go to East Palestine, a community that gets devastated. Still nothing's happened. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1828.28s)]
*  We have several hundred recommendations open for aviation. You want to do something about it, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1833.4s)]
*  adopt the recommendation of the NTSB. You'll save lives. Get off and do something. I don't [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1838.2s)]
*  want to have to meet with another set of those parents like that again. Not fair. Could be your [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1845.24s)]
*  family. Sorry. I didn't mean to take it out on you. Just hard. Sorry. Yeah. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1850.52s)]
*  I have two and I just want to follow up because I want to make sure I understand [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1862.68s)]
*  the question correctly. The flight data recorder on the CRJ is showing 325 plus or minus 25. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1866.76s)]
*  That's correct, right? The question is, and I apologize. I've said this three or four times. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1877.24s)]
*  On the CRJ, the flight data recorder that has been localized from the ADSB data and other [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1882.84s)]
*  is showing the time of impact. It was at 325 plus or minus 25 feet. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1891.08s)]
*  The question again, the preliminary data that we have not validated yet and are still trying to [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1904.36s)]
*  verify was that the radar scope was showing the helicopter at 200 feet. Now again, you can have, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1911.8s)]
*  we're not saying plus or minus because we don't really know that. It's not as granular. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1917.96s)]
*  We will have the exact data set tomorrow, tomorrow evening. We knew you would have some questions, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1922.44s)]
*  so please be responsible in reporting this. We need more info, but we know that some of [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1927.4s)]
*  that information is coming out and we're trying to provide it. No more. Sorry. I've answered the [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1931.88s)]
*  same question several times. Sorry. Go ahead. This is just a clarification point on this topic. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1937.32s)]
*  I understand what the radar scope in the ATC cap was showing and what the black box showed you from [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1943.88s)]
*  the CRJ. I guess the question is, what would explain the discrepancy, which appears to be 100 [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1952.1200000000001s)]
*  feet when clearly they hit each other? So the question is, what would explain the discrepancy? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1959.0s)]
*  That's what our job is, is to figure that out. That's what we're doing. That's the reason we're [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1967.96s)]
*  giving you information to dispel some misinformation that may be out there. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1973.24s)]
*  We're the gold standard across the world because we tell the facts and sometimes we have to give a [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1978.92s)]
*  little bit something preliminary so that you don't have an improper picture. That's what we're trying [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1983.72s)]
*  to do. Thank you. Thank you very much. The 45 second delay that you described, where was that? [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=1988.68s)]
*  We've been listening to NTSB officials update us on what they've learned since Wednesday night's [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=2003.72s)]
*  American Airlines plane crash with a Blackhawk helicopter. For now, a short break. You're [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=2008.36s)]
*  watching CBS News 24 seven. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxyEW5R22U&t=2013.72s)]
