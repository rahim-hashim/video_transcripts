# Thousands of IRS employees expected to be fired by Trump administration this week
**CBS News:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU)
*  Hello and thank you for joining us. We are officially one month into the new administration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=0.0s)]
*  and President Trump is continuing with his efforts to reshape the federal government. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=4.0s)]
*  He signed another executive order Wednesday, this one aimed at the quote reduction of the federal [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=8.16s)]
*  bureaucracy. It will abolish federal advisory committees including one that advises the health [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=12.96s)]
*  department on long covid and a council that advises on regulating consumer prices. It's one of at least [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=18.64s)]
*  executive orders penned by the president so far including 16 on foreign policy, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=25.6s)]
*  10 on diversity equity and inclusion, 7 on immigration and 13 on the federal government. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=30.64s)]
*  Cutting down the federal workforce has also been a defining part of President Trump's first month [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  back in the White House. CBS News has learned more than 6,000 IRS employees are expected to be [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=40.32s)]
*  fired by the end of the week including 3,500 from the small business self-employed division. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=45.68s)]
*  CBS News Chief White House correspondent Nancy Cortez joins me now. Nancy, one month 73 executive [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=50.8s)]
*  orders, more than 100 executive actions. Is this a new record and is it safe to say we have a clear [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=57.44s)]
*  picture of the president's plans over the next four years? It's definitely a new record and it's an [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=62.72s)]
*  indication of how quickly this administration plans to move now that President Trump is back in office [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=68.4s)]
*  and it's a striking change Lindsay from his first term when he and many of his aides were [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=75.12s)]
*  learning the ropes and frankly many of his aides were trying to hold him back from some of the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=81.2s)]
*  things that he wanted to do. That is not the case this time around and you pointed out the job cuts [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=85.2s)]
*  across the federal government they are moving ahead with full force on those particularly when [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=92.16s)]
*  it comes to the IRS. We are told that that they are cognizant of the fact that we are in tax filing [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=97.36000000000001s)]
*  season right now and so their first rounds of cuts primarily affect people who work in enforcement [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=104.88s)]
*  in the small business branch in particular so they say it won't necessarily have much of an [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=111.92s)]
*  impact on people who are trying to file their taxes right now. What does enforcement mean like audits? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  Correct so if you don't pay your taxes if you underpay your taxes if you lie or cheat on your [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=125.6s)]
*  taxes that's when enforcement might be in order and it's important in the small business section [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=131.6s)]
*  in particular because that's often where they find tax underpayment at higher rates than in larger [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=139.44s)]
*  corporations or in individual taxes and so it's likely that it'll have some kind of effect. We're [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=147.68s)]
*  looking at a cut of about five percent of the IRS workforce but those cuts are going to be [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=154.4s)]
*  implemented in stages so it remains to be seen whether we'll be looking at less revenue down the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=161.52s)]
*  road as a result of these cuts. I guess that's a good thing I don't know what an enforcement IRS [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  agent is they haven't come knocking on my door yet. President Trump has repeatedly vowed that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security those are not on the chopping block when Republicans in Congress [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=177.12s)]
*  propose cuts to the budget but this week we saw President Trump support a house GOP funding plan [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=182.16s)]
*  that among other things would cut funding to Medicaid. Can you understand help us understand [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=187.12s)]
*  what's happening? Absolutely so there's this huge bill that Republicans are planning to try to move [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=191.12s)]
*  through Congress ran through Congress with Republican support only it does a lot of different [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=198.64s)]
*  things it it beefs up immigration enforcement more physical barriers for immigration there [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=203.76s)]
*  there is an energy package in that bill as well but the big price tag has to do with the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=212.96s)]
*  2017 era Trump tax cuts that are expiring that they want to renew and that is going to cost about [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=221.28s)]
*  4.5 trillion dollars and more conservative members of the Republican Party are insisting [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=229.2s)]
*  that that needs to be offset with spending cuts somewhere else. Well it is really hard to find [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=236.16s)]
*  4.5 trillion dollars to easily cut from the federal budget it's actually impossible so they're [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=242.16s)]
*  they're setting their sights lower but still when you're looking for cuts anywhere near that [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=249.2s)]
*  magnitude you look at entitlements Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid so House Republicans want [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=253.92s)]
*  to cut from Medicaid. President Trump while he says he supports their big bill it has a lot of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=260.32s)]
*  his priorities in it he has also said as recently as the other night in an interview with Fox News [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=265.2s)]
*  that he's not going to touch Medicaid so he'll be forced to go one way or the other at some point [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=270.32s)]
*  but right now he's saying both. Nancy Cortez thank you. Later this hour we will speak to [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=277.12s)]
*  Dr. Celine Gounder a closer look at the health impact of these Medicaid cuts to Americans. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbdoLPW_wRU&t=281.92s)]
