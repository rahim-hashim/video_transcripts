# Breaking down Trump's pardons for nearly all Jan. 6 defendants, including violent offenders
**CBS News:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q)
*  Today marks Donald Trump's first full day in office as the 47th president of the United [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=0.0s)]
*  States. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=4.78s)]
*  He'll sit down with top lawmakers on the Republican side to discuss his legislative agenda. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=5.78s)]
*  The president wasted no time in his White House return, signing a record number of executive [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=10.28s)]
*  actions and issuing pardons for almost all 1,500 defendants charged in connection with [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=20.26s)]
*  Instead of worrying about political agendas, you don't have to worry about that at all. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=24.16s)]
*  There's only one focus, defeating America's enemies. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=28.7s)]
*  We're not going to be defeated. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=33.1s)]
*  We're not going to be humiliated. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=34.66s)]
*  We're only going to win, win, win. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=36.66s)]
*  All right, for more on this, I'm joined by CBS News Chief White House correspondent, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=40.22s)]
*  Nancy Cordes. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=45.379999999999995s)]
*  Nancy, let's start with those January 6 pardons. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=46.9s)]
*  Break down this executive order. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=51.22s)]
*  What exactly does it do? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=53.18s)]
*  What it does, Vlad, is wipe the slate clean for virtually all of the 1,500, 1,600 January [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=56.38s)]
*  6 defendants. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=64.10000000000001s)]
*  Those who are currently in jail will be getting out of jail if they haven't already. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=65.82000000000001s)]
*  For example, there were two brothers who were just sentenced on Friday to two and a half [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=71.22s)]
*  years in prison for assaulting police officers. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=75.9s)]
*  They have already, as of last night, been released from the D.C. jail. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=80.30000000000001s)]
*  There's this small handful of people, a little over a dozen, who were charged with seditious [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=85.14s)]
*  conspiracy, the ringleaders, essentially. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=90.53999999999999s)]
*  Their sentences will be commuted. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=93.61999999999999s)]
*  And so, basically, what you have here is a decision by President Trump that does not [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=96.25999999999999s)]
*  distinguish between those who were violent and those who were not. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=101.25999999999999s)]
*  He's just giving a blanket pardon to everyone involved in what happened that day. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=106.46s)]
*  Of course, people shouldn't be surprised, Nancy. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=111.41999999999999s)]
*  He had signaled this throughout the campaign season that he was going to do this. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=113.74000000000001s)]
*  But the question I have is, what's the reaction from not people within his own party, but, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=117.54s)]
*  for example, police officers, Capitol police officers, and the unions who represent them? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=122.26s)]
*  There's a lot of anger. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=128.82s)]
*  As you can imagine, Michael Fanon, who has been outspoken throughout, he's a former D.C. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=129.9s)]
*  police officer who was beaten on January 6. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=134.78s)]
*  He told CBS News last night that he felt betrayed and that the American people own this, in [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=138.5s)]
*  his words, for electing Trump. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=144.26000000000002s)]
*  The family of Brian Sicknick, who also died in the days after January 6, they put out [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=147.70000000000002s)]
*  a statement saying essentially that this makes a mockery of the U.S. justice system. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=154.18s)]
*  There are Democrats who have called this obscene. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=159.3s)]
*  There are Republicans, most notably the new vice president of the United States, who said [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=164.26s)]
*  that there should be a dividing line and that perhaps those who were accused or convicted [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=169.1s)]
*  of violent acts should not be pardoned. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=174.98s)]
*  The fact that President Trump did not end up making that distinction has not garnered [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=179.74s)]
*  any kind of reaction from them for the most part yet. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=185.22s)]
*  You really get the feeling that they didn't want to be criticizing the new commander in [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=189.17999999999998s)]
*  chief and his first day on the job. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=194.57999999999998s)]
*  So let's talk about the first day, Nancy, where we now know that some leaders from the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=197.94s)]
*  GOP are expected to meet with the president later today at the White House. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=202.42s)]
*  During that slew of executive actions, there was a lot of focus on some of the culture [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=206.64s)]
*  war stuff, renaming Mount McKinley, for example, or denali back to Mount McKinley, the Gulf [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=210.6s)]
*  of Mexico, brouhaha. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=217.02s)]
*  But I suspect that these Republicans want to talk about, for example, ending the war [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=218.9s)]
*  in Ukraine, which the president said he would do on day one, or perhaps bringing down the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=223.85999999999999s)]
*  price of groceries. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=228.18s)]
*  How does that figure in some of these discussions? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=229.46s)]
*  Right. It's notable that you mentioned Denali, for example, because the state's two [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=232.1s)]
*  Republican senators, Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski, have been against changing the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=236.74s)]
*  name from Denali to Mount McKinley. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=242.78s)]
*  And Murkowski put out a pretty harshly worded statement after President Trump made that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=244.82s)]
*  announcement yesterday saying that to Alaskans it is Denali and it should stay that way. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=251.14s)]
*  But nevertheless, according to the president, it is changing. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=258.26s)]
*  As for the meeting with Republican leaders today, basically this is meant to sort of all [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=261.54s)]
*  get on the same page. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=268.18s)]
*  There are some really big things that President Trump and Republicans in Congress want to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=269.26s)]
*  do right away that are going to require a great deal of coordination if they're going [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=274.46s)]
*  to get it across the finish line in a very closely divided Congress, most notably [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=280.62s)]
*  reinstating the Trump tax cuts, which are set to to expire towards the end of this [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=286.53999999999996s)]
*  year. So they want to extend those. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=292.14s)]
*  And they also want to pass legislation that that has to do with energy in this country [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=294.26000000000005s)]
*  and expanding drilling. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=303.14000000000004s)]
*  So there's a lot on their plate that they'll be talking about today. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=305.22s)]
*  And I know you'll be tracking it all for us. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=308.14000000000004s)]
*  Nancy Cordes on a very cold day in Washington, D.C. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=309.74s)]
*  Thank you, Nancy. You got it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkxYBJTn-Q&t=312.86s)]
