# Biden, Harris meet with preemptive pardons announced for Fauci, Milley and Jan. 6 committee members
**CBS News:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU)
*  I want to take a look now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the North Portico of the White House. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=1.2s)]
*  You see the president and the first lady, the Biden's there. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=4.36s)]
*  They are going to be greeting the vice president, Kamala [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=8.0s)]
*  Harris, as she returns to the White House one last time. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=11.1s)]
*  And we should note, too, of course, the president-elect [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=16.48s)]
*  and his wife will soon be making their way to the White [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=19.48s)]
*  House for the traditional tea and a discussion of the two [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=22.0s)]
*  of them together. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  And then the president and the president-elect [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=26.96s)]
*  will ride together to the United States Capitol. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=29.2s)]
*  Let's take a moment here and just watch what's happening. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=33.44s)]
*  Robert? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=38.04s)]
*  What a moment for President Joe Biden, elected to the Senate [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=39.0s)]
*  in 1972, sought the presidency in 1988, 2008, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  eight years as vice president to President Obama. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Now this political career, after more than a half century, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  comes to an end. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  Some disappointment in Democratic ranks, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=56.08s)]
*  but a lot of pride in President Biden's inner circle [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=57.84s)]
*  about what he accomplished on domestic and foreign policy [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  over the last four years. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=63.56s)]
*  I want to bring in senior White House correspondent, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=64.8s)]
*  Weijia Jiang. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=66.88000000000001s)]
*  She is at the White House. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=67.44s)]
*  And Weijia, as we look at these pictures of the president [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=69.28s)]
*  and the vice president, they are leaving office [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=72.72s)]
*  with some breaking news issuing some final preemptive pardons. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=76.12s)]
*  What have we learned? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=80.04s)]
*  That's right, Nora. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=81.72s)]
*  We know that President Biden has already [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=82.44s)]
*  more than 4,000 pardons, especially in his final weeks [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=84.64s)]
*  of office. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=88.92s)]
*  But he chose to use the final hours of his presidency [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=89.48s)]
*  to issue these preemptive pardons. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=93.64s)]
*  And it matters because it's not about the personal individuals. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=96.04s)]
*  It really speaks to the state of politics in this country today. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=99.0s)]
*  And he essentially said in a lengthy statement [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  that he wants to protect these people from revenge. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=107.64s)]
*  Because even though Gail said success might [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=111.92s)]
*  be the best form of revenge, we know [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  what the president-elect has said extensively about payback, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=117.92s)]
*  about retribution, about going after his political enemies. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=122.68s)]
*  And so that is why today, President Biden [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  issued these pardons. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=129.8s)]
*  He said, I am exercising my authority under the Constitution [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=131.84s)]
*  to pardon General Mark A. Milley, Dr. Anthony S. Fowchee, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=135.44s)]
*  the members of Congress and staff who served on the select committee, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=139.67999999999998s)]
*  and the US Capitol and DC Metropolitan Police [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=143.72s)]
*  officers who testified before the select committee. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  Of course, that is in reference to investigating [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=149.11999999999998s)]
*  what happened four years ago on January 6. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  And notably, it includes some of Trump's fiercest political rivals, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=155.48s)]
*  including two Republicans, former Congresswoman Liz Cheney [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=160.11999999999998s)]
*  and former Congressman Adam Kinzinger, along with Adam Schiff. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=165.11999999999998s)]
*  And so, Nora, again, this really speaks [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=168.64s)]
*  to where President Biden is thinking could happen [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  as president-elect Trump takes office. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  And as you mentioned, he is preparing now [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=179.76s)]
*  to welcome President-elect Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=181.55999999999997s)]
*  here to the White House for that traditional tea. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  They will spend a lot of intimate moments together. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=189.6s)]
*  But, Nora, based on the pardons today, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=192.92s)]
*  based on what we heard from President Biden in his final days [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  here at the White House, speaking about the warnings [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=200.76s)]
*  to come with a new administration, as you can imagine, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  those moments, those conversations could be tense. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=207.2s)]
*  And, Weijia, we understand that President Biden [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  just spent his final moments inside the Oval Office? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=214.35999999999999s)]
*  That's right. This morning, he received his final [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=217.92s)]
*  presidential daily brief. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=220.83999999999997s)]
*  And I did peek in front of the West Wing, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  as you know very well, if there's a Marine sentry [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=225.2s)]
*  standing there, standing guard, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  it means that he is inside the Oval Office. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=229.2s)]
*  And he was there, but he must have had a quick walk [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  to the North Portico to prepare to welcome guests [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=235.32s)]
*  here to the White House. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  But I did speak to aides this morning who said [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  it was really important to him to have that time in the Oval, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  because it's not just capping the past four years [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=245.23999999999998s)]
*  of his presidency, it is capping an entire political career. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=248.2s)]
*  And we don't know where he goes from here, Nora, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=252.2s)]
*  but at the end of today, he will be heading off [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=254.16s)]
*  to California for some rest. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=256.96s)]
*  And we know last night he said, I'm not going anywhere. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=259.24s)]
*  He said he wants to stay engaged, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=262.28s)]
*  and we should expect to hear more of him. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=264.24s)]
*  Nora. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=266.68s)]
*  And, Weijia, we understand President Biden left a letter [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=268.28s)]
*  for the incoming president? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=271.24s)]
*  He is expected to leave a letter, Nora. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=273.48s)]
*  We are told, of course, he is an institutionalist, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=275.76s)]
*  which is exactly why he is hosting the Trumps here, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=278.44s)]
*  why he is participating in all the traditions. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=282.24s)]
*  And we know that this letter, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=286.0s)]
*  that presidents leave for each other, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=289.24s)]
*  means a lot to Donald Trump, because he has spoken [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=291.36s)]
*  about how much the letter that President Obama left him [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=295.40000000000003s)]
*  meant to him four years ago. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=298.8s)]
*  And we know that despite the fact that Trump [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=302.2s)]
*  decided not to participate in all the traditions [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  that we are talking about and celebrating today [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=308.36s)]
*  when it comes to the peaceful transfer of power, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=310.72s)]
*  of course, he left town the morning of inauguration, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=312.76s)]
*  even Trump left a letter for President Biden [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=316.32s)]
*  on the resolute desk of the Oval Office. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=319.8s)]
*  So we certainly expect President Biden to do the same today. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  Nora. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO48-Qen8XU&t=326.36s)]
