# Why Sen. Schmitt blasted military DEI practices during Hegseth's hearing
**CBS News:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c)
*  Senator Schmidt. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=1.72s)]
*  I'd like to submit for the record a letter submitted by Mr. Christopher Onn, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=2.56s)]
*  the former director of operations for Vets for Freedom. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=5.76s)]
*  Mr. Onn, his letter states that the suggestion, quote, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=8.8s)]
*  the suggestion that funds were misused for personal gain, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=12.52s)]
*  lavish parties, or other improper purposes is categorically false. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=14.64s)]
*  Throughout my time working with Pete Hegseth, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=18.0s)]
*  he consistently demonstrated exceptional integrity in leadership. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=20.88s)]
*  I ask unanimous consent to enter this letter into the record. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=24.2s)]
*  With? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=26.92s)]
*  Letter into the record. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=27.32s)]
*  Without objection, so ordered. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=28.28s)]
*  Senator Schmidt. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=29.880000000000003s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=30.68s)]
*  Mr. Hegseth, good to see you here today. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=31.48s)]
*  Thank you for your service. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=32.88s)]
*  Thank you, Senator. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=34.24s)]
*  And your willingness to serve. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  I also want to thank you for your clarity in articulating the vision you have for [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=36.52s)]
*  the Department of Defense in restoring an ethos, a warrior ethos. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=43.0s)]
*  Which is in stark contrast to the ethos we've seen the last four years, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=50.88s)]
*  which is of weakness and wokeness. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=54.44s)]
*  And I want to drill down on a few things specifically and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=57.88s)]
*  exactly how we've gotten to where we've gotten with recruiting and morale. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  DEI. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=66.08s)]
*  There's been a little bit of discussion about this. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=67.28s)]
*  But for those watching at home, DEI is not about giving everybody opportunity. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  It is rooted in cultural Marxism. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=74.2s)]
*  The idea that you pit the room, any room, with oppressor versus oppressed. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=77.16s)]
*  It's race essentialism, and it is poison. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=83.44s)]
*  It has no business whatsoever in our military. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  I think the American people have spoken loudly and clearly about this. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=90.48s)]
*  They're tired of this. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=94.0s)]
*  They're tired of woke ideology. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=95.8s)]
*  And to my Democrat colleagues on the other side, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=98.48s)]
*  if you haven't picked up on that, you missed the plot. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=100.76s)]
*  Cuz that's what November 5th partially was about. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=104.16s)]
*  And so let's talk specifically about some of these DEI programs that have been [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=106.68s)]
*  funded. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=109.92s)]
*  In our academy, specifically the Air Force Academy, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=111.2s)]
*  it was advised as disfavored language [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=113.92s)]
*  to refer to your mom and dad as mom and dad. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  Okay? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=126.52s)]
*  Dear mom and dad, I'm writing home, don't say that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=127.64s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=130.76s)]
*  We're all just people, you can't say that either. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=133.32s)]
*  And in an effort to police this, in a 1984 Orwellian novel, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=136.6s)]
*  there was actually an eyes and ears program to rat on your fellow students [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=143.12s)]
*  who might say mom and dad. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  Or just say in a tough situation, you know what, we're all just people, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=151.6s)]
*  can't say that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=154.6s)]
*  This wasn't limited, by the way, to our academies. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=156.28s)]
*  The Secretary of the Air Force, our current Secretary of the Air Force, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=162.28s)]
*  in a memo from August of 2022, thought we had too many white officers. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=168.0s)]
*  Advocated for quotas. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=174.72s)]
*  And if you crunch the numbers, that meant that 5,800 white officers [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=176.76000000000002s)]
*  who worked really hard should be fired. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=181.88s)]
*  In the United States of America, I don't know how we got here. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=185.0s)]
*  And by the way, the Air Force isn't alone here, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=189.96s)]
*  the Navy sorta touted a drag queen influencer. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=191.68s)]
*  This stuff is insane. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=195.68s)]
*  And people wonder why recruiting is dropped off. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=197.16s)]
*  And let me just go through a few numbers, and I wanna get your comments [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=199.72s)]
*  on how we fix this, because it's gone completely off the rails. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=202.48s)]
*  In 2022, the Army missed their recruiting goal of 60,000 soldiers by over 15,000. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=206.04s)]
*  In 2023, the Navy missed their recruiting goals by over 7,000. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=212.44s)]
*  In 2022, the Air Force couldn't meet their standards, their numbers, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=217.24s)]
*  even though they lowered their standards. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=223.6s)]
*  They've lowered their standards to meet numbers they still can't get to. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=228.92s)]
*  Mr. Heksef, we gotta fix this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=233.2s)]
*  I think what you've demonstrated today is that you have the talent and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=237.24s)]
*  the ability and the desire to fix it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=241.32s)]
*  How are you gonna fix it? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=244.48s)]
*  Well, Senator, first and foremost, upfront, you have to tear out DEI and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=246.24s)]
*  CRT initiatives, root and branch out of institutions. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=252.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  And then you have to put in Army, Navy, and Air Force secretaries and others, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=256.44s)]
*  civilian positions at the helm who are committed to the same priorities [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  that the President of the United States is, and if confirmed, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  the Secretary of Defense will be. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  Send a clear message that this is not a time for equity. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=269.36s)]
*  Equity is a very different word than equality. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=273.48s)]
*  Equality is the bedrock of our military. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=276.36s)]
*  Men and women, duty positions in uniform, black, white, doesn't matter. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=279.6s)]
*  We treat you equally based on who you are in the image of God as an individual. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=283.4s)]
*  And we all get the same bad haircuts. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=288.12s)]
*  You're not an individual, you're part of a group. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=291.96s)]
*  Equity prescribes some sort of an outcome based on differing attributes that we [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=294.44s)]
*  have that divide us. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=299.76s)]
*  What skin color are you? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=301.16s)]
*  What gender are you? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=302.96s)]
*  And then infuse that into institutions which manifest in things like quotas, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=305.04s)]
*  formal or informal, which does what to morale? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=309.24s)]
*  Sends it in the tubes. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=312.36s)]
*  And it makes people feel like they're being judged by something other than how [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=313.88s)]
*  good they are at their job, which is poisonous inside institutions. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=317.72s)]
*  So on top of this recruiting crisis, that wasn't enough for this administration. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=320.88s)]
*  During the COVID hysteria and in their attempt to fire 100,000 people who work [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=327.24s)]
*  for bigger companies because they didn't get the COVID shot or to mask five-year-olds, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=333.8s)]
*  they decided also to make this a central plank in their policy at the Pentagon. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=337.8s)]
*  8,000 well-trained, so we got a recruiting crisis, 8,000 well-trained men and [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=344.24s)]
*  women were fired, were fired. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=349.88s)]
*  Will you commit today, Mr. Hexeth, to recruit these folks back, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=353.48s)]
*  to give them back pay, and give them an apology from the United States government [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=359.32s)]
*  for how they were disrespected? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  Senator, I will commit to this because the commander in chief has committed to this. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=366.76s)]
*  That not only will they be reinstated, they will receive an apology, back pay, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=371.28s)]
*  and rank that they lost because they were forced out due to an experimental vaccine. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=376.2s)]
*  Thank you, and I'm a limited time, but I just wanna say, for all the talk of [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  experience and not coming from the same cocktail parties that permanent [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=387.28s)]
*  Washington is used to, you are a breath of fresh air. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=392.56s)]
*  And again, if you weren't paying attention to what this election was all about, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=397.2s)]
*  it was about the disruptors versus the establishment. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=401.2s)]
*  And the American people have had enough of business as usual for [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=405.24s)]
*  the same people that we line up for these same jobs who give us the same results. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=408.64s)]
*  We need somebody who's gonna go in there and fight for innovation, fight for change. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=413.76s)]
*  I think you're that person, and I appreciate your willingness to sit here and [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=417.88s)]
*  listen to some of these undignified attacks. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=422.4s)]
*  It's ridiculous, thank you. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtmC_rsC2c&t=425.28s)]
