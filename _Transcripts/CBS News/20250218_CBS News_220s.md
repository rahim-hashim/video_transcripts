# Rubio, Waltz on discussions moving fast with Russia
**CBS News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs)
*  Turning our monitors now to Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=0.0s)]
*  The world watched as U.S. and Russian officials met for nearly five hours to discuss the war [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=2.5s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=8.1s)]
*  These talks come just days after President Donald Trump announced he called President [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=9.1s)]
*  Putin to start negotiations to end that war immediately. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=13.18s)]
*  CBS News Chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes joins us from West Palm Beach for more. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=16.94s)]
*  Nancy, thank you for joining us again today. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=22.18s)]
*  What stood out to you after this press conference with Marco Rubio? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=25.3s)]
*  Good afternoon, Mugo. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=30.0s)]
*  A couple of things. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=32.78s)]
*  First of all, the fact that Secretary of State Rubio and the president's national security [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=33.78s)]
*  adviser Mike Waltz said they want to move fast, that this was just the first meeting, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=39.3s)]
*  but they plan to move ahead quite quickly. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=44.620000000000005s)]
*  They want to arrange a meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin quickly, and they [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=47.24s)]
*  want to bring about an end to this war sooner rather than later. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=53.260000000000005s)]
*  They also said that they want to make sure that whatever the end result is, that it is [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=57.2s)]
*  something that is permanent, that doesn't lead to another outbreak of violence in a [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  couple of years. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=66.88s)]
*  Basically, when you look big picture, this is a complete reversal of U.S. policy towards [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=68.88s)]
*  Russia, and I think that that is the most stunning thing coming out of these four and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=74.2s)]
*  a half hours or so of meetings that Secretary of State Rubio and other Trump advisers held [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=78.44s)]
*  with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=84.04s)]
*  Basically, they came out of those meetings saying that rather than view each other as [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=88.48s)]
*  foes, the U.S. and Russia actually want to work closer with one another diplomatically, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=93.12s)]
*  economically, and they are looking forward to strengthening those bonds, which is something [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=99.12s)]
*  very different than what we've been hearing out of Washington officials for the last several [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=105.38000000000001s)]
*  years. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=110.0s)]
*  Nancy, it's important to note here that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was not part [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=111.0s)]
*  of this meeting. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=116.52s)]
*  How did this delegation respond to accusations that the United States bypassed Ukraine and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=118.16s)]
*  Europe in these negotiations? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=123.88s)]
*  What they said was that the negotiations, when they get down to the nitty-gritty, obviously [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=128.88s)]
*  will involve Ukraine, though that wasn't good enough for Volodymyr Zelensky, who has gone [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=133.56s)]
*  ahead and postponed a meeting that he was supposed to have in Saudi Arabia later this [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=138.16s)]
*  week. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=143.52s)]
*  He wants a seat at the table from the very beginning. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=144.52s)]
*  As far as the Europeans are concerned, they said yes, the Europeans will have to be involved [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  at some point as well because they've got big sanctions on Russia. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=150.16s)]
*  When it comes time to negotiate the economics of this deal, Europe will have to be involved. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=155.88s)]
*  That's not much comfort to European leaders who say, wait a minute, we have spent billions [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=161.4s)]
*  of dollars to help support Ukraine throughout this conflict. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=165.96s)]
*  Now you're telling us we're only going to have a seat at the negotiating table when [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=170.04000000000002s)]
*  it's time for us to remove our sanctions on Russia. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=173.24s)]
*  We want to be more intimately involved than that, particularly because any responsibility [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=176.96s)]
*  for safeguarding Ukraine, supporting Ukraine in the long term, is most likely going to [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=184.44s)]
*  fall heavily on the Europeans. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=190.3s)]
*  A great deal of frustration being expressed with the way these talks are developing, but [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=193.76s)]
*  not that surprising given President Trump's views toward the war and the invasion and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=198.84s)]
*  the fact that he has always had much more of an affinity towards Putin and towards Russia [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  than his predecessor, President Biden, did. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=211.68s)]
*  Okay, Nancy Cortez, thank you so much for your insight and joining us again today on [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=214.28s)]
*  the stream. Appreciate it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQPr0pgfjs&t=218.12s)]
