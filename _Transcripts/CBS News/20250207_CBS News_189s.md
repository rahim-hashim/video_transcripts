# Trump to meet with Japan's prime minister; attorneys general to sue over DOGE
**CBS News:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo)
*  President Trump will meet with Japan's Prime Minister, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=0.0s)]
*  Shigeru Ishiba, today. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Ishiba is the second foreign leader [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  to visit Washington this week. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=6.28s)]
*  The meeting is expected to focus on the alliance [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=8.16s)]
*  between the U.S., Japan, and other Asian nations. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=10.76s)]
*  Weijia Jiang joins us now from the White House [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=14.44s)]
*  with more on this. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=16.32s)]
*  Weijia, what might we expect out of the President's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=17.16s)]
*  conversation with the Prime Minister? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  And certainly, we would assume that China will be [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=22.32s)]
*  in the room discussion-wise, at the very least. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=25.44s)]
*  Absolutely, Errol. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  China is certainly one of the many areas [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=29.72s)]
*  that these two countries have in common, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=33.0s)]
*  especially as it relates to how to combat [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=34.88s)]
*  its increasing aggression. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=37.4s)]
*  And so, I think the difference here, Errol, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=40.32s)]
*  while Trump and former President Biden [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=43.16s)]
*  have a lot of the same policy goals [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=45.84s)]
*  as it relates to this specific region, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  the approach is different. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=50.64s)]
*  I think Japan's Prime Minister wants to be able [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=52.84s)]
*  to massage those conversations with the President here [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  to ensure that he views the allyships [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=60.31999999999999s)]
*  with not only Japan, but other countries in the region, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=64.72s)]
*  Australia, India, so they can continue the work [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=67.84s)]
*  that was done under the previous administration. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=72.19999999999999s)]
*  But we also know that President Trump, of course, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  is very different when it relates [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=76.64s)]
*  to building these relationships. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=78.72s)]
*  And I think one big topic of concern [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=80.92s)]
*  will be the bilateral trade agreements [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=83.56s)]
*  between these two countries. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=85.52s)]
*  We've already seen the President threaten [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=86.52s)]
*  and almost impose tariffs on our North American allies, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=90.56s)]
*  Mexico and Canada. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=94.52s)]
*  So I think Japan will want some kind of reassurances [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=96.0s)]
*  that there is not going to be a tariff trade war [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=98.52s)]
*  in the coming weeks or months. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=102.19999999999999s)]
*  And also, Weijia, New York Attorney General Letitia James [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=104.44s)]
*  and at least a dozen other state attorneys general [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=107.6s)]
*  plan to file a lawsuit against the Trump administration [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=110.64s)]
*  specifically over Doge. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=113.52s)]
*  What exactly are they arguing? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  Specifically over Doge's access [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=117.55999999999999s)]
*  to sensitive information, Errol. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=119.91999999999999s)]
*  They are very concerned about the way in which [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=122.16s)]
*  Elon Musk's team has been able to get a hold of files [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=124.8s)]
*  that are typically very private [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=130.84s)]
*  that have to do with federal workers and their information. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=133.2s)]
*  So James did send out a lengthy press release in it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=136.4s)]
*  She said, the President does not have the power [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=140.8s)]
*  to give away our private information to anyone he chooses [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=142.56s)]
*  and he cannot cut federal payments approved by Congress. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=145.96s)]
*  And so there are of course a host of issues. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  She goes on to say the level of access [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  for unauthorized individuals is unlawful, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=154.8s)]
*  unprecedented and unacceptable. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=157.52s)]
*  And Errol, this is just one of many different legal challenges [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=160.72000000000003s)]
*  that the Trump administration faces [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  for his executive orders and for their policy proposals. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=166.48s)]
*  And so we should expect a lot of court analysis [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  in the coming weeks and perhaps even years, Errol, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=177.16s)]
*  as they go to court over many of Trump's ideas. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, we're gonna jump into more of that right now. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  Weijia Zhang, thanks very much. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  Enjoy your weekend. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D342dCoXtJo&t=188.23999999999998s)]
