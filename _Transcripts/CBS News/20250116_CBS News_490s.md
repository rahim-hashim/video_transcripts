# DeSantis picks Florida AG Ashley Moody to fill Marco Rubio's Senate seat
**CBS News:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k)
*  It's taking now to Orlando, Florida, where Governor Ron DeSantis is announcing his pick [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=0.0s)]
*  to fill Marco Rubio's Senate seat as the current senator moves closer to confirmation for Secretary [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=7.0s)]
*  of State. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=12.56s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=13.56s)]
*  ... particularly Supreme Court justices play in enforcing the Constitution and particularly [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=14.56s)]
*  the constitutional limits on federal power. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=19.32s)]
*  We need a senator that understands the important role that Senate plays in confirming Supreme [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=22.84s)]
*  Court appointments as well as lower courts, and the model for justices need to be justices [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=28.68s)]
*  like Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=35.34s)]
*  Finally, Republicans must fight the woke agenda and they must defeat the radical left. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=41.68s)]
*  Florida has fought and won against the woke agenda. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  We have won time and time again against the political left, and right now the Democratic [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=55.92s)]
*  Party in this state lies in ruins, and we are a solid Republican state, which people [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=61.0s)]
*  didn't think was possible even five years ago. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=66.26s)]
*  At the national level, we need to rid our institutions, federal agencies, universities, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=69.0s)]
*  corporations of the pernicious woke ideology and woke agenda. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=74.68s)]
*  We need to restore common sense, and we need to restore basic American principles throughout [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=80.12s)]
*  our society once again. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=85.84s)]
*  Now, in appointing a U.S. senator, I initially put out several different criteria. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=87.64s)]
*  One, I want somebody that's going to work with President Trump to deliver on the mandate [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=93.44s)]
*  he earned from the American people. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  I want a senator that's going to be willing to lean in against the excessive spending [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=100.08s)]
*  and cut spending and stop the inflation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  I want somebody that understands that the federal bureaucracy is run amok and it must [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=108.64s)]
*  be held to account, and we need three branches of government, not four branches of government. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=113.56s)]
*  We need somebody that understands the fight against illegal immigration, is willing to [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=119.64s)]
*  shut the border, and, and importantly, make sure any legal immigration to this country [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=125.04s)]
*  is putting Americans first. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=131.8s)]
*  Can't be bringing foreigners in to displace our own people in key positions. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=134.52s)]
*  This is something that I thought about long and hard. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=139.4s)]
*  We did a lot of research. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=142.64s)]
*  We got a number of great candidates throughout the state of Florida, and many of them, I [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=143.64s)]
*  think, could have done a good job. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  But the final criteria I used was, because you can say all those things and say you stand [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  for it, I wanted somebody with a demonstrated record of delivering results on those important [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=156.32s)]
*  issues. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=162.64s)]
*  Talk is cheap. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=163.64s)]
*  We need people that have demonstrated fidelity to these principles with their actions. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=164.64s)]
*  So that is why today I'm proud to announce that I am selecting our Attorney General, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=169.86s)]
*  Ashley Moody, to serve as our next U.S. Senator. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=175.06s)]
*  So, many of you know her. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=179.06s)]
*  She's obviously been on the ballot twice statewide and won big victories. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=201.32s)]
*  She's honorably served our people as her time as Attorney General over these last six years. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=206.04s)]
*  She's a fifth generation native of Plant City, Florida, in the Tampa Bay area, and even what [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=211.6s)]
*  was named Queen of the famous Strawberry Festival back in her youth. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=218.64s)]
*  She's a triple Gator graduate of the University of Florida. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=226.34s)]
*  She's built an impressive resume as a commercial litigator and as a federal prosecutor. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=231.7s)]
*  When she was an assistant U.S. Attorney here in the Middle District of Florida, she handled [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=237.67999999999998s)]
*  gun and fraud cases. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=241.32s)]
*  Later when she was in the Tampa Narcotics Division, she was recognized for her prosecutorial [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=243.11999999999998s)]
*  excellence by federal agencies. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=248.44s)]
*  In 2007, she became Florida's youngest circuit court judge at the tender age of 31, where [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=251.12s)]
*  she championed initiatives for at-risk children and expanded access to legal representation [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=257.94s)]
*  for vulnerable Floridians. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=263.62s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=264.62s)]
*  You are watching Florida Governor Ron DeSantis delivering remarks to the press where he has [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=265.62s)]
*  just announced that he is selecting Florida's current Attorney General, Ashley Moody, to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=272.68s)]
*  fill the Senate seat that has been left vacant that will be left vacant should Senator Marco [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=278.96s)]
*  Rubio be confirmed as our next Secretary of State. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=285.28s)]
*  CBS News Chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes is joining me now from West Palm Beach, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=287.53999999999996s)]
*  Florida. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=293.34s)]
*  Nancy, first let's talk about, it seems almost, I think we talked about this yesterday, if [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=294.34s)]
*  there's anybody who's going to sail through and may even pick up some Democrats when he [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=299.05999999999995s)]
*  gets confirmed, it's probably Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=304.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=309.34s)]
*  I mean, he is a long-time senator. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=310.34s)]
*  He knows the senators who will be voting on him very well. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=312.84s)]
*  He is the one nominee who, from the very beginning, when you talk to Republican aides, they said [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=317.24s)]
*  he is almost certainly going to be one of the very first Cabinet picks to be confirmed, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=322.76s)]
*  probably on the same day that Trump is sworn in. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  This announcement by DeSantis is particularly interesting because you'll remember that Donald [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=331.08s)]
*  Trump's own daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, was floated as a possible replacement for Marco [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=336.58s)]
*  Rubio if DeSantis was willing to appoint her. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=344.58s)]
*  Trump and DeSantis, who haven't always seen eye to eye, have spent more time together [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=348.46s)]
*  lately, most notably on the golf course this week. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=353.3s)]
*  But DeSantis signposted a while back that Lara Trump was probably not going to be the pick. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=356.26s)]
*  And you heard why in that announcement just now. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=365.12s)]
*  It is because Ashley Moody, who is the state's attorney general who has already been elected [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=368.96s)]
*  twice in the state of Florida, who is a long-time DeSantis ally, is – has always been at the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=374.4s)]
*  top of the list. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=382.08s)]
*  Not only is she close to DeSantis, but this also potentially clears the way for DeSantis [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=383.68s)]
*  to name his own chief of staff and long-time aide to her position if he is so inclined. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=389.56s)]
*  So a lot of upsides for DeSantis here in naming Ashley Moody to this very coveted spot, appointing [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=396.66s)]
*  her to take Marco Rubio's seat if he is indeed confirmed next week. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=402.74s)]
*  Yeah, and Nancy, was there anything controversial for our viewers who may not have watched CBS [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=407.78s)]
*  News 24-7 during the confirmation hearing of Marco Rubio? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=414.18s)]
*  Was there anything that struck those senators asking questions as unusual or controversial? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=418.26s)]
*  Nothing that would impede his nomination and his confirmation. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=426.53999999999996s)]
*  He spoke relatively bluntly about the path forward in Ukraine. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=431.9s)]
*  He – you know, he said that Russia is obviously the instigator and that it is not going to [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=437.21999999999997s)]
*  win, it is not going to achieve its original goals of taking over Ukraine. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=443.15999999999997s)]
*  But he also said Ukraine is not going to look like it did before either, that essentially [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=448.06s)]
*  the borders of Ukraine after a negotiation are not going to be what they were before. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=454.14000000000004s)]
*  He said that's just a geopolitical reality, that Russia is going to gain some Ukrainian [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=461.86s)]
*  territory. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=466.90000000000003s)]
*  That's something that you don't typically hear from Democratic leaders or the White [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=467.90000000000003s)]
*  House in those kinds of very blunt terms because they don't want to go into a negotiation [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=471.46s)]
*  already conceding that Russia's tactics would have been successful. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=478.06s)]
*  But Rubio was pretty blunt yesterday. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=483.06s)]
*  Yeah, indeed. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=484.85999999999996s)]
*  All right, Nancy Cordes for us. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=485.85999999999996s)]
*  Thank you very much, Nancy. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=488.2s)]
*  Appreciate it as always. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4y3FWEa3k&t=489.2s)]
