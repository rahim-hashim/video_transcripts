*  has imposed sweeping tariffs on China. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=22.2s)]
*  Here are the issues on the table today. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=25.2s)]
*  We're talking trade, the economy, and security. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=26.68s)]
*  In a statement released just yesterday, the prime minister said he wants to confirm with [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=29.92s)]
*  President Trump that Japan and the United States will act in cooperation. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=34.0s)]
*  CBS News White House digital reporter Aaron Navarro is live in Washington right now. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=38.56s)]
*  He joins us. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=43.56s)]
*  And Aaron, thank you for being here. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=44.56s)]
*  What do we expect to come out of today's meeting between the two leaders? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=46.28s)]
*  Mugo, good to be with you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=50.32000000000001s)]
*  We could see some news about U.S. steel and that billion-dollar bid by Japan's Nippon [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=52.92s)]
*  Steel to take over that American company. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=58.16s)]
*  The CEO of Nippon Steel was actually at the White House for a meeting with the president [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=61.36s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=65.44s)]
*  Trump has historically opposed this merger, but Nippon Steel said they hope that this [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=66.92s)]
*  visit by Prime Minister Ishiba will try to convince Trump otherwise. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=71.2s)]
*  And Aaron, the president shared, has he rather shared anything about his expectations? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  What is he hoping to get out of this meeting today? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=81.0s)]
*  So nothing too detailed from Trump himself, but senior White House officials told reporters [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=85.4s)]
*  this morning in a preview of this meeting today that the main theme is to reinforce [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=91.0s)]
*  the close alliance between these two countries. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=95.88000000000001s)]
*  Trump had a friendly relationship with the former Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, but [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=98.84s)]
*  officials said to expect more talk of Japanese investment in the United States, potentially [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=103.56s)]
*  more energy exports from the U.S. to Japan. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=108.44s)]
*  They also talked about potential ideas when it comes to developing artificial intelligence [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=111.6s)]
*  and semiconductors, as well as increased cooperation on defense equipment and technology, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  something particularly important for the U.S. in that region of the Pacific. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=123.08s)]
*  And just how important is it for these two leaders to strengthen their alliance between [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=128.48s)]
*  the two nations as well, obviously? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=133.44s)]
*  Yeah, crucial, especially with U.S. adversaries in the sense in North Korea and China in that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  region. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=141.88s)]
*  White House officials noted that the Trump administration is committed to the, quote, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=142.88s)]
*  complete denuclearization of North Korea and said that the U.S. will be in lockstep [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=146.56s)]
*  with both Japan and South Korea when it comes to that issue. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=151.68s)]
*  But this is also the first meeting between the two leaders, so definitely just an introduction [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=155.52s)]
*  as they begin to reinforce the alliance between the two countries. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=161.12s)]
*  OK, Erin Navarro reporting for us from the White House. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=164.88s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time today. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=167.28s)]
*  So let's take a look at Trump's schedule for the rest of the day. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=169.96s)]
*  At 2 p.m. Eastern, the president will officially announce the White House Faith Office before [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=173.8s)]
*  signing new executive orders. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=179.52s)]
*  About two hours later, Trump will hold a phone call with the president of Panama. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=181.76s)]
*  It comes just two days after Trump said government ships can pass through the canal free of charge. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=186.44s)]
*  Panama quickly addressed that claim, saying it was based on a false city. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=192.0s)]
*  We also have our eye on the future of USAID workers. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  Just before midnight, all agency employees will be placed on leave, including those who [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  work internationally. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  The Trump administration says it will keep 611 essential staff members. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvYcX5Jehi4&t=207.56s)]
