# Landslide dangers growing in California in wake of wildfires
**CBS News:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM)
*  All right, now to California, where fire crews improved containment on the palisades and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=0.0s)]
*  eaten fires, but you now have a new concern, landslides. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=5.2s)]
*  You see the strong winds and water used by firefighters have shifted and saturated the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=8.44s)]
*  ground, making homes along hillsides very unstable. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=16.8s)]
*  One house that survived the fire ended up split in half by the landslide. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  And although some residents have been allowed to return home, you've got tens of thousands [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  of people still waiting. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=26.26s)]
*  CBS News senior weather correspondent Rob Marciano joins us now from the Pacific Palisades [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=28.32s)]
*  in front of a house that split in two. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=32.84s)]
*  And Rob, to us, it's stunning for the owners. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=34.8s)]
*  It's heartbreaking. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  And that's just one of thousands of sad stories. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=38.36s)]
*  Yeah, the owner of this home, it's a rental for him. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=41.52s)]
*  His real-time home in the palisades, that was burned down as well. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=46.8s)]
*  The land here is so stripped of vegetation that it's unstable even without water. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  Now, we're not quite sure if this is from firefighters dropping water above the hillside. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=56.92s)]
*  It could be just from unstable ground above the hillside, taking out some pipes or something [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=60.88s)]
*  like that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  There's an investigation that's ongoing, but it doesn't really matter because this is the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  end result. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=69.04s)]
*  And it's horrific. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=70.04s)]
*  And this could be the case going forward. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=71.04s)]
*  I don't think we need a whole lot of rain to take down some of these hillsides because [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=73.28s)]
*  they are completely stripped of the brush, of the grasses, and in many cases of the trees [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=77.16s)]
*  and the roots that hold down the land here. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  And it's very, very hilly. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=84.84s)]
*  So we've got that to contend with. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  You mentioned that we have got a little bit more of a handle on the containment. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=87.55999999999999s)]
*  The fires really aren't burning right now. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=91.6s)]
*  So they're trying to get people back in here, but it's obviously unsafe in many, many areas. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=94.6s)]
*  So it's been very, very slow repopulation, mostly in areas that haven't been impacted [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=99.91999999999999s)]
*  directly by the fire. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  And obviously, there's hundreds of thousands of victims that have been directly impacted [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=105.1s)]
*  that are still homeless out and about in LA, staying with friends and just trying to see [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=109.6s)]
*  what their next steps are, Errol. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=113.5s)]
*  And while we're thankful that the winds have decreased, the National Weather Service is [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=115.76s)]
*  warning of dangerous conditions for next week. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=120.08s)]
*  So what's that about? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=122.68s)]
*  We finally had the winds decrease and then shift onshore. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=126.88s)]
*  You can feel it's cooler. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=129.6s)]
*  It's a little bit more humid. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=130.72s)]
*  We'll take that firefighter. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=131.72s)]
*  We'll also take that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=132.72s)]
*  That'll help keep any sort of hot spots down. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=133.72s)]
*  And that will continue tomorrow and Sunday. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=136.16s)]
*  So that's great news. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=139.36s)]
*  Bad news is that we've got another set up for Santa Ana to come Monday, Tuesday. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=141.88s)]
*  So they'll have to deal with that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=145.16s)]
*  There's no rain in the forecast still in this area until further notice. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=146.6s)]
*  But obviously, we don't want a lot of rain coming in because that is going to cause a [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=151.04s)]
*  whole bunch more mudslides. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=155.14s)]
*  So we're just taking it day by day here with everybody else. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=157.0s)]
*  They have such a long road ahead. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=160.64s)]
*  And for many people, really, the horror show is only begun when they go back to their homes [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=162.6s)]
*  and start to somehow see what they do next, Errol. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=167.2s)]
*  Yeah, one day at a time. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=171.24s)]
*  It's all folks can do that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=172.24s)]
*  Rob Marciano, we appreciate your reporting. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=173.64s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZpsoCUrcM&t=175.23999999999998s)]
