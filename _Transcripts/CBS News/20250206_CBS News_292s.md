# Judge temporarily blocks Trump's deferred resignation program deadline
**CBS News:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E)
*  All right, when we see it, you see it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=0.0s)]
*  Breaking news on 24-7, as promised as always, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=1.4000000000000001s)]
*  two new developments and two lawsuits [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=4.48s)]
*  against the Trump administration. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=5.98s)]
*  So first, let's break this down. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=7.24s)]
*  Birthright Citizenship, a second judge [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=9.28s)]
*  now calls that executive order regarding [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=11.5s)]
*  birthright citizenship unconstitutional. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=14.66s)]
*  Second, another judge has blocked a Trump plan [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=17.18s)]
*  offering incentives for federal workers to resign. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=20.3s)]
*  So a lot to break down here. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  Legal analyst and trial attorney, Robin Nunn, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=24.740000000000002s)]
*  joins us live. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=26.86s)]
*  Robin, let's first start with the federal workers [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=27.72s)]
*  resignation portion, because today [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=30.32s)]
*  is that important deadline. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=31.9s)]
*  So what now happens to those federal workers [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=33.72s)]
*  who woke up this morning and said, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=35.68s)]
*  hey, I have a deadline today to make a decision? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=36.96s)]
*  Yeah, it seems as if the judges actually blocked [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=39.96s)]
*  the government's efforts to make a decision [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=42.96s)]
*  and this deadline for today, and has asked for more time [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=45.68s)]
*  to consider their issue more. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=48.86s)]
*  So hopefully federal workers will get [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=50.54s)]
*  some sort of communication from the government, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  letting them know that the deadline has been extended. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  OK, so now let's go back to the birthright citizenship [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=57.9s)]
*  conversation, because we know days ago that Seattle judge [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=60.42s)]
*  really put a foot in the door and said, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=64.42s)]
*  no, this is unconstitutional. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=65.86s)]
*  Now we have word of a second judge sort of affirming that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=67.26s)]
*  So is this just dead on arrival for executive orders [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=70.58s)]
*  for Trump where birthright citizenship is concerned? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=72.78s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=76.02s)]
*  I think this is going to be a bit of a longer process. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=76.82s)]
*  I think the Trump administration has committed [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=78.82s)]
*  to appealing any of the decisions that come down this week [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=81.5s)]
*  and has said that they are unsurprised [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=85.88s)]
*  that these particular judges have decided in this way. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=87.64s)]
*  I think this is going to be a longer fight. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=90.2s)]
*  And I think there's going to be a real constitutional [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  question here as to whether birthright citizenship [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  should be read to include people that are born here [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=96.96s)]
*  or are not born here or parents who are born here [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=100.68s)]
*  or not born here. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  I think this is going to be a much longer fight. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=103.88s)]
*  All right, so US District Judge George O'Toole Jr. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=107.12s)]
*  in Boston didn't express an opinion [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=109.48s)]
*  on the legality of that program. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=111.16s)]
*  He scheduled a hearing from Monday at 2 p.m., [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=112.48s)]
*  we understand he also directed administration officials [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=114.46s)]
*  to extend the deadline to apply for that program [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=117.17999999999999s)]
*  until after the hearing. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=119.58s)]
*  What can you tell us there? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=120.53999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, sort of similarly. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=121.94s)]
*  I think that a lot of the judiciary [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=123.66s)]
*  that is considering these issues wants more time [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=126.06s)]
*  to reflect, more time to research, to hear the arguments. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=128.6s)]
*  I think there is an overwhelming amount of flurry [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=131.9s)]
*  of arguments on these recent executive orders, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=135.42s)]
*  including this one. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=138.06s)]
*  And I think that we'll probably hear more next week. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=139.02s)]
*  Okay, so let's put that aside [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=142.52s)]
*  and let's talk about this other piece of litigation, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=144.92s)]
*  the lawsuit by the FBI to prevent the names [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=147.2s)]
*  of those working on those January 6th inquiries [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=149.48s)]
*  from being released. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=152.18s)]
*  A lot of FBI agents saying, if you release our names, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=153.56s)]
*  you're compromising us to the entire crime community, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=156.16s)]
*  compromising the safety of our families even. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=159.12s)]
*  Where is that lawsuit today? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=161.2s)]
*  Yeah, they're seeking a temporary restraining order. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=163.0s)]
*  They are worried about their privacy, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=165.48s)]
*  they're worried about their security. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=167.3s)]
*  The plaintiffs in that particular case are FBI agents [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=168.96s)]
*  who said that their safety is at risk [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=171.66s)]
*  if their identities are known. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=173.17999999999998s)]
*  They not only worked on the January 6th sort of issues, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=174.73999999999998s)]
*  but they've worked on broader issues [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=177.73999999999998s)]
*  involving murders and narcotics [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=179.22s)]
*  and serious felony issues. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=181.33999999999997s)]
*  So I think that there's a broader constitutional issue [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=184.77999999999997s)]
*  in terms of they were doing what they were asked to do [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=187.29999999999998s)]
*  in the capacity of their roles [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=190.06s)]
*  and whether or not their identities can be disclosed now. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=191.44s)]
*  So on the other side of things, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=195.7s)]
*  the Department of Justice is now suing the city of Chicago [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=197.85999999999999s)]
*  over their sanctuary city laws. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=200.86s)]
*  We just heard ICE of Denver talk about the difficulty [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=203.26s)]
*  of doing what they want to do in a so-called sanctuary city [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=206.38s)]
*  relative to that city. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=209.82s)]
*  What's the argument here? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=211.22s)]
*  Yeah, the immigration battle is ongoing. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=212.7s)]
*  I think this is probably a predicted step. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=215.8s)]
*  There's been a lot of discussion about sanctuary cities, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=218.46s)]
*  especially Chicago. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=221.06s)]
*  There's been a ton of emphasis around these ICE crackdowns. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=222.3s)]
*  Sanctuary cities have committed to not participate, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=225.8s)]
*  to not use local law enforcement [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=228.24s)]
*  to get involved with the federal efforts. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=230.12s)]
*  And now the DOJ, I think, is really pushing back [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=232.04s)]
*  and calling their bluff as whether they will continue [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=234.72s)]
*  to receive federal funding if they will not participate [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  in federal programs such as immigration crackdowns [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=240.16s)]
*  and things like this. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=243.4s)]
*  Do you see how New York did participate [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=244.66s)]
*  and sort of a shock by a lot of people in the country [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=247.4s)]
*  that Mayor Eric Adams granted some participation? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=250.04s)]
*  Do you think that weakens the case of Chicago? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=252.85999999999999s)]
*  I don't. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=255.85999999999999s)]
*  I think that this basically boils down [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=256.7s)]
*  to that there are some cities that obviously have chosen [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=258.48s)]
*  with their electorate to not participate [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=261.38s)]
*  and some that have. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=264.1s)]
*  And the mayor of Chicago seems very committed [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=265.54s)]
*  to not changing Chicago away from being a sanctuary city, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=268.02000000000004s)]
*  much like, you know, obviously the mayor of New York [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=272.14000000000004s)]
*  has decided to move in a different direction. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=274.42s)]
*  The question is whether federal funding can be attached [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=276.94s)]
*  to cities that decide not to participate [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=279.98s)]
*  in these immigration crackdowns that are going on right now. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=282.82s)]
*  Following the laws, the legalese, and the money. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=286.32s)]
*  Robin, thank you so much. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  It's nice to talk to you on CBS News 24 seven. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKioPQPC_3E&t=289.96000000000004s)]
