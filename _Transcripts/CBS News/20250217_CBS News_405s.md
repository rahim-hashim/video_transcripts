# Officials give update on upside down plane crash landing in Toronto
**CBS News:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo)
*  We interrupt evening news plus to take you to Toronto where officials are giving an update on the crash landing of a Delta passenger plane earlier this afternoon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=0.0s)]
*  We are also going to be talking about the first responders at the airport. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=13.84s)]
*  The facts of the matter around this event that happened at approximately 2.30 p.m. is Delta Airlines flight 4819 from Minneapolis to Toronto operated by subsidiary Endeavour Air was involved in a single aircraft accident upon landing at Toronto Pearson. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=17.84s)]
*  The plane was carrying four crew and 76 passengers, among them 22 Canadians. The other passengers were multinational. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=35.84s)]
*  Airport emergency workers mounted a textbook response reaching the site within minutes and quickly evacuating the passengers. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=45.84s)]
*  We set up our emergency operations centre with Delta Airlines and representatives from fire, police, paramedics, security and our federal agency partners. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=53.84s)]
*  Again, there were no fatalities. 17 injured passengers were quickly taken to local area hospitals. At this time, we do not know of any of those passengers having critical injuries. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=63.84s)]
*  We immediately halted further arrivals and departures on our remaining three runways. Those runways were reopened at approximately 5 p.m. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=75.84s)]
*  The other runways are remaining to serve the investigation, which will be carrying forward for the rest of tonight and into the next several days. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=86.84s)]
*  These two runways will remain closed while our investigation or while the investigation takes place. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=96.84s)]
*  Again, we are very grateful that there was no loss of life and relatively minor injuries. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=101.84s)]
*  We are very focused on the care and the concern and the passengers and the crew, some of whom have already been reunified with their friends and their families. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=107.84s)]
*  Others, we have in a comfortable place right here at the airport in an environment where they're getting a lot of care and support from my staff. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=117.84s)]
*  Delta Airlines is also continuing to provide customer care and information for passengers. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=125.84s)]
*  In closing, no airport CEO wants to have these type of press conferences, but this is exactly what our emergency, our operations, and our first responder partners are all practiced and trained for. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=132.84s)]
*  And again, this outcome is in due part to their heroic work, and I thank them profusely. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=147.84s)]
*  Our thoughts and prayers are with all. We will be providing more information as it becomes available. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=153.84s)]
*  We do expect that there will be some operational impact and some delays at the airport over the next few days while the two runways remain closed for the investigation. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=160.84s)]
*  And we will be sharing information periodically for those traveling. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=169.84s)]
*  Continue to look at our website and be in touch with your respective carrier as well. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=173.84s)]
*  Thank you for your time today. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=178.84s)]
*  We just heard an update on that plane crash in Toronto from a flight originating from Minneapolis, St. Paul that landed upside down. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=180.84s)]
*  Let's bring in Bruce Landsberg. He's a former vice chairman for the National Transportation Board. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=189.84s)]
*  So, Bruce, we just heard from Deborah Flint, the president and CEO of the airport, saying that it was a textbook response from emergency workers saying there were no fatalities. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=194.84s)]
*  Confirming 17 injuries saying that those people were taken to the hospital. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=205.84s)]
*  She said they don't know of any having critical injuries. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=209.84s)]
*  We did hear from a local paramedic company that had reported one child and two adults in critical condition. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=212.84s)]
*  We will work to get an update on that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=218.84s)]
*  But do you agree that this was a textbook response from emergency workers? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=221.84s)]
*  Thank you, Lindsay. Absolutely. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=225.84s)]
*  Thank you, Lindsay. Absolutely. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=230.84s)]
*  The Canadians do a first class job generally. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=233.84s)]
*  And one of the areas of investigation that the NTSB always looks at and we will be assisting the Canadian Transportation Safety Board, who's leading the investigation. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=237.84s)]
*  One of the key areas that we look at is the emergency response. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=250.84s)]
*  And was it adequate? Was it timely? And how did all of that play out? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=254.84s)]
*  And I think based on what we can see here that it was very helpful. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  Not only did you have the flight crew able to assist passengers in evacuating, but the first responders were also there. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  As you can see from the picture here, we have a couple of exit side doors that are open. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=273.84s)]
*  And the good news is that you don't see a lot of luggage out there. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=279.84s)]
*  I may have commented on this earlier, but it's critically important in a crash situation. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=284.84s)]
*  Leave your luggage and get off the aircraft as quickly as possible. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=290.84s)]
*  The other area that I think NTSB will have an interest in, it's been mentioned several times that there was an infant that was injured. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=296.84s)]
*  And we don't know the extent of their injuries, although it's been mentioned as possibly critical. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=305.84s)]
*  NTSB has been critical of our FAA about not requiring child safety seats in aircraft. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=310.84s)]
*  And this is something that is likely to come up once again. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=319.84s)]
*  I want to ask you about something that you remarked on earlier with me. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=324.84s)]
*  And that is also that something like this is indicative of the lengths that engineering has come to also, that there were no fatalities in something like this. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=327.84s)]
*  Can you help us understand how the engineering of the plane also could have led to this being a relatively safe situation for those on board? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=338.84s)]
*  Well, if you look at the fuselage, it has remained remarkably intact. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=349.84s)]
*  And one of the benefits that we will have in studying this crash is we have all of the flight data and cockpit voice recorders and possibly some security camera video, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=355.84s)]
*  which will show pretty clearly the crash dynamics and the fact that the fuselage held together. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=367.84s)]
*  It was just essential for preventing much injury. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=374.84s)]
*  And it's fascinating to me. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=378.84s)]
*  I don't recall ever seeing an airplane where the wing section completely separated and left the fuselage intact. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=380.84s)]
*  So I think our the engineering teams, both from the NTSB and from the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, are going to be very interested in that. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=389.84s)]
*  Bruce Landsberg, thank you. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7goqVWUYGo&t=401.84s)]
