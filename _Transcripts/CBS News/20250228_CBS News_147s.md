# Graham says Zelenskyy should apologize to Trump after Oval Office clash
**CBS News:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig)
*  Let's bring in CBS News chief White House correspondent now Nancy Cortez outside the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=0.0s)]
*  White House. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=4.9s)]
*  And just hearing now, Nancy, that Zelensky has canceled his speech at the Hudson Institute. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=5.9s)]
*  I wonder how significant that is. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=10.74s)]
*  NANCY CORTEZ, CNN NEWSHOUR ANCHOR, NBC NEWSHOUR Well, it's definitely a sign that things have [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=12.8s)]
*  gotten seriously off track here in Washington, D.C., Chanel, a city where Zelensky has so [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=16.54s)]
*  often gotten a warm reception, but apparently his team informed the Hudson Institute that [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=24.64s)]
*  he would not be attending that public Q&A. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=30.28s)]
*  And now we're watching to see if he goes ahead with a scheduled interview with Fox News, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=33.6s)]
*  scheduled for a little bit later today. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=39.0s)]
*  Here at the White House just a short time ago, longtime Trump ally Lindsey Graham, senator [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  from South Carolina, spoke to reporters, and he said that Zelensky, if he wants to get [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=46.56s)]
*  things back on track with Trump, needs to apologize and that if he doesn't, then the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=52.199999999999996s)]
*  only other option is for him to step aside and send someone new to negotiate with Trump [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=58.959999999999994s)]
*  because Zelensky ostensibly is not going to get anywhere any longer. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  That reflects the public sentiments of the Republicans who have been willing to speak [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  publicly about this conflict so far. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=76.0s)]
*  Most of them showing support for President Trump, saying that it was Zelensky who was [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=79.04s)]
*  disrespectful, who challenged the president one too many times, who asserted his position [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=84.44000000000001s)]
*  one too many times when he should have been more deferential to the president of the United [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  States. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=94.92s)]
*  And Nancy, interesting that that would come up, this notion of Zelensky having to now [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=95.92s)]
*  apologize before he returns to the White House. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=99.92s)]
*  I want to ask you about JD Vance because it was him who first used that word disrespectful. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  He has sort of a key pivotal role in this discussion. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=108.36s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=111.24s)]
*  He was actually the first, after sitting there silently for most of the conversation, to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=112.92s)]
*  kind of go after Zelensky and say, you haven't apologized, you haven't thanked the United [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=118.2s)]
*  States, I haven't heard you say thank you once, and saying that Zelensky needed to be [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=125.48s)]
*  more grateful, almost berating him the way you would berate a sullen teenager. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=130.76s)]
*  And that's what really got President Trump ginned up as well, and things just unraveled [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=137.44000000000003s)]
*  from there. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  Okay, Nancy Cordes live for us outside the White House this hour. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expDvVvxOig&t=146.4s)]
