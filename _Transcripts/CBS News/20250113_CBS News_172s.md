# Southern California wildfires destruction grows
**CBS News:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo)
*  Wind speeds are picking back up across Southern California following a weekend of calmer conditions [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=0.0s)]
*  that did allow crews to fight the wildfires that are still just raging in that area. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=5.8s)]
*  The Palisades Fire and the Eaton Fire, the two largest wildfires in the area, are only [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=10.6s)]
*  13 percent and 33 percent contained respectively. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=15.48s)]
*  In all, at least 24 people have died, more than two dozen people are still missing, and [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=19.8s)]
*  more than 40,000 acres have burned. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=25.2s)]
*  This morning, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass praised the people of her city for helping [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=28.06s)]
*  those in need. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=32.18s)]
*  Angelinos, as we continue to experience the shock, the grief and the anger, we have to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=33.66s)]
*  stand together and it is in that spirit that we have seen hundreds, if not thousands of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=41.06s)]
*  Angelinos traveling all around the region to deliver supplies, clothes, whatever they [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=47.46s)]
*  think might help the victims of these fires. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=54.22s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Adam Yamaguchi reports from the Pacific Palisades neighborhood about [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=59.32s)]
*  20 miles west of downtown Los Angeles. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=63.58s)]
*  Lindsay, I'm standing at the entrance to what used to be a home here in the Pacific Palisades. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=66.06s)]
*  I'm seeing nothing but destruction all around me in this neighborhood, with the exception [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=71.82s)]
*  of a few structures that are still standing in place. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=76.62s)]
*  Everything else seems to be wiped out. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=80.58s)]
*  In fact, 75 percent of this area is said to have been completely decimated, and it's [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=82.14s)]
*  only when I look off into the horizon that I can see intact structures and rows. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=88.58s)]
*  That just marks how much devastation there is. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=93.58s)]
*  Firefighters are continuing at this point to work on building further containment lines. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=96.18s)]
*  The containment levels stand at around 14 percent as of this morning. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=100.54s)]
*  And they had a window of opportunity this weekend when the winds died down significantly [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=104.38s)]
*  with a short amount of time to try to, again, build those containment lines. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=109.98s)]
*  Those are the buffer zones that surround a fire to prevent them from hopping over and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=114.30000000000001s)]
*  spreading using all the fuel that's in the way. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=118.86s)]
*  And they do that by clearing out brush, clearing out debris of structures that were partially [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=121.9s)]
*  burned, again, in the hopes of preventing what we saw last week from continuing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=126.94s)]
*  Now, again, there has been a lull for the last few days, the last couple days, I should [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=131.98000000000002s)]
*  But those winds are expected to come back and come back strong. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=136.54s)]
*  The National Weather Service has issued another red flag warning of the highest designation. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=139.98s)]
*  That is a particularly dangerous situation that is expected to start at around 4 a.m. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=145.74s)]
*  local time overnight and continue into the afternoon tomorrow. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=152.62s)]
*  So by no means are we out of the woods. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=156.42000000000002s)]
*  And officials across the city are urging people to continue to stay away from these evac zones [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=158.9s)]
*  so that the firefighters and officials can do what they need to do to prevent further damage. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=165.22s)]
*  Adam Yamaguchi, thank you. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVv9Nkb5zo&t=169.46s)]
