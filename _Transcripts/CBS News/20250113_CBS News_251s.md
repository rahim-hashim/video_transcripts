# At least 24 people dead in California wildfires with more high winds in forecast
**CBS News:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0)
*  We begin with those deadly wildfires in Southern California. They've now claimed the lives of at [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=0.0s)]
*  least 24 people and destroyed thousands of structures. This morning crews are racing to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=5.12s)]
*  gain control of those fires because powerful winds in the forecast could cause explosive fire growth. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=10.56s)]
*  These winds combined with low humidities and low fuel moistures will keep the fire threat in all [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=17.84s)]
*  of Los Angeles County very high. Now at this moment the Palisades and Eaton fires, those are [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=25.68s)]
*  the two largest, remain mostly uncontained. Joining us now for more on the ground in Southern California [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=32.72s)]
*  is CBS News correspondent Charlie DeMar. Charlie, tell us what you've seen just in the past day or so. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=38.56s)]
*  And Errol, good morning. There was a lot of optimism from firefighters over the weekend, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  especially Sunday because those winds had died down. But of course the focus now is on the Santa [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=52.24s)]
*  Ana winds. We could see wind gusts up to 60 miles per hour. Now that is a lot less than what we saw [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  earlier last week when this fire event started, but of course that is going to create a lot of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=65.36s)]
*  concern. All the progress that has been made, there is some concern that some of those hot spots, some [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  of those embers may flare up again and we could be dealing with even more wildfires throughout the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=75.76s)]
*  next few days. I know that some firefighters from other states are helping. There's some resources [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=82.56s)]
*  pledged from other countries even. What are the federal and state resources allocated now to help [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=89.04s)]
*  people who've lost everything? Well that has also been a big change in this firefight is the resources. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=94.4s)]
*  In the first few days there just weren't enough firefighters to address what needed to be done, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=102.48s)]
*  how widespread this fire was. But now there are firefighters on the ground from all over the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=107.68s)]
*  country and as you mentioned this is an international fight. There are aircraft from Canada capable of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  dropping large amounts of water on the fire which has been key in getting some control on this fire [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  and just over the weekend crews from Mexico came in and they are now on the frontline of this [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=124.64s)]
*  firefight. As for assistance, the governor here in California urging people to file with the federal [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=131.28s)]
*  government. This has been declared a federal emergency disaster zone so they can, they are [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=138.48s)]
*  eligible, people are eligible for federal assistance if they apply locally here at the state level. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=144.64s)]
*  People who've been impacted by this fire are eligible for some tax relief, some delayed, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=150.64s)]
*  when their taxes are due would be delayed, Errol. All right, Charlie Demar with the ongoing struggle [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=156.96s)]
*  there in Southern California, thank you. The FEMA administrator says she's concerned for the safety [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=162.88000000000002s)]
*  of firefighters battling those flames in Southern California. Diane Criswell told our Margaret Brennan [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=168.56s)]
*  on Face the Nation yesterday the powerful winds in the area have changed the dynamics of this fire [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=174.08s)]
*  and she pushed back on claims LA officials were unprepared. I think that they were very prepared. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=180.08s)]
*  This is something that they are very used to. They fight fires all the time but they have never seen [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=186.56s)]
*  100 mile an hour winds that are fueling the fire and those winds and that weather condition [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=192.72000000000003s)]
*  is what really impacts you know where this fire is going to go but more importantly how they're [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  able to try to contain it in those first few hours and days and because it was in such a populated [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=202.56s)]
*  area it just makes it that much more challenging to be able to get in there and secure the perimeter [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=208.4s)]
*  but as well try to save as many homes as possible. Criswell also said the cost for this disaster both [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=213.84s)]
*  from infrastructure and economic losses will be significant and there's a new offer on the table [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  to help fight the flames in California and it's coming all the way from Ukraine. President Vladimir [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=227.12s)]
*  Zelensky posted on X that government officials are preparing for the potential deployment of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=232.24s)]
*  Ukrainian firefighters to California and that 150 are already prepared and if you're looking [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFSAhC4YD0&t=237.44s)]
