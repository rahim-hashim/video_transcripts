# What we know about the victims of the D.C. midair plane crash
**CBS News:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8)
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=0.0s)]
*  We're getting more details about some of the people who died in Wednesday's midair collision [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=1.0s)]
*  near Reagan National Airport. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Among the mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters were a handful of top figure skaters, young [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=8.68s)]
*  men and women coming back from a development camp in Wichita, Kansas. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=14.24s)]
*  Six of the victims were affiliated with the skating club of Boston. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=18.76s)]
*  Other skaters at the club who had been in Wichita but left earlier spoke about this [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=22.56s)]
*  loss. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=27.6s)]
*  Being able not to see them anymore, this is something that will take a lot of time for [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=29.360000000000003s)]
*  us to process and it will never be the same but they will always be remembered. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=35.64s)]
*  We want to let everyone know that the skating club of Boston will forever remember them. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=41.84s)]
*  Tom Hanson joins us live outside the Ashburn Ice House. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=47.0s)]
*  This is in Northern Virginia with more on these lives cut short. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=49.52s)]
*  I understand that location linked to some of these folks, Tom. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=53.08s)]
*  Help us understand the impact that this tragedy is having on this community. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=57.6s)]
*  Yeah, well this is just a devastating impact on the entire skating community. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=65.4s)]
*  We've seen it firsthand, Errol. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=69.12s)]
*  Behind me yesterday we saw a steady stream of people coming into the ice house to pay [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=71.4s)]
*  their respects to the people that they believe or suspect were on these flights. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  I gotta just tell you, talking to some of these teenagers and young people who have [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=83.32s)]
*  been around the area, it's just heartbreaking to hear the impact that it's having on these [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=88.08s)]
*  young skaters. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=94.8s)]
*  One 14-year-old who we spoke to said that she believes that she has lost several of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=95.8s)]
*  her best friends in that crash. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=101.36s)]
*  A 10-year-old also came forward yesterday and was talking to press about the impact [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=104.24s)]
*  that this all was having on her and her ambitions to continue skating. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  It really just goes to show that so many people in this community are deeply impacted. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=115.84s)]
*  It's a tight-knit community. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=120.92s)]
*  This is a group of young people who not only train together, not only compete together, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=122.36s)]
*  they travel together, they study together, all of the above. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=128.28s)]
*  One loss is devastating enough, let alone several, from one ice house or one skate club [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=133.0s)]
*  like the one behind me, Errol. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=140.4s)]
*  What struck me yesterday, Tom, was hearing Nancy Carrigan, the famed skater, cry as she [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=142.08s)]
*  speaks saying her husband was being asked to do interviews. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=147.24s)]
*  She thought that was strange because she just didn't know what to do, but she did want to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=150.36s)]
*  be around her fellow skaters. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=154.76s)]
*  She did want to show emotional support. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=156.84s)]
*  Let us understand some of the other lives lost and this sense of just being together [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=159.72s)]
*  in this horrible moment. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=165.12s)]
*  Well, an interesting side note for Nancy Carrigan is she actually comes from one of the skating [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=167.76s)]
*  clubs that has been affected by this crash, losing at least six people from that one skating [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=176.44s)]
*  Also, that same skating club in Boston lost a number of skaters about 60 years ago in [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=185.16s)]
*  a separate plane crash. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=191.92s)]
*  We're talking about elite skaters here. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=193.6s)]
*  Some of the best of the best were in Wichita, some with ambitions to achieve the same accomplishments [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=196.12s)]
*  as Nancy Carrigan, to be on the Olympic team, to be winning Olympic medals. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=203.12s)]
*  A lot of them, that was not far out of reach based on their talent and skill level. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=208.84s)]
*  We're talking some world class skaters here and so no doubt Nancy Carrigan can empathize [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=213.04000000000002s)]
*  and relate, especially when she is thinking about the people that she competed against, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  the people that she traveled with. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=224.0s)]
*  So no doubt she has some really profound insight into the devastation that these young skaters [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  are going through. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=236.24s)]
*  Yeah, our hearts go out to all victims and relatives of victims, skaters or not, but [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=237.24s)]
*  thanks for helping us understand how this is hitting the skating community. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=241.76s)]
*  Thanks, Tom. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuuKSfDZ8&t=245.4s)]
