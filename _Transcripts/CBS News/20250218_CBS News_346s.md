# More Trump-Putin direct talks expected after Saudi Arabia diplomatic meeting, official says
**CBS News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM)
*  U.S. and Russian officials say they'll begin working on a path to end the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=0.0s)]
*  The two sides finished discussions in Saudi Arabia today without Ukraine being invited [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=5.2s)]
*  to the table. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=9.540000000000001s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio says the talks were part of a larger process. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=11.16s)]
*  We're not going to pre-negotiate an end to this conflict. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=15.82s)]
*  These are the kinds of things that have to happen through hard and difficult diplomacy [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=20.12s)]
*  and closed rooms over a period of time. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=23.48s)]
*  The goal of today's meeting was to follow up on the phone call the president had a week [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  ago and begin to establish those lines of communication. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  Let's now head over to West Palm Beach with CBS News Chief White House correspondent Nancy [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=33.64s)]
*  Cortez. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=37.04s)]
*  Nancy, what are U.S. officials saying about these talks with their Russian counterparts? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=38.04s)]
*  Well, they're saying, Lindsey, that they expect that they will be followed up fairly [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=41.6s)]
*  quickly by more talks, including direct conversations between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=47.84s)]
*  They say they want to move quickly. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  They want to negotiate a lasting end to this conflict that does not involve Russia and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=56.22s)]
*  Ukraine falling into another dispute in a couple of years. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=63.3s)]
*  And they said, interestingly, that any negotiated settlement would involve a lifting some or [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=68.34s)]
*  all of the massive U.S. sanctions that have been placed on Russia over the past few years [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=74.7s)]
*  after it in an unprovoked manner invaded Ukraine and has been fighting for territory [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=81.02s)]
*  there ever since. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=87.02s)]
*  Nancy, how different is this policy and this administration stance compared to the Biden [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=88.3s)]
*  administration's? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=92.66s)]
*  Publicly, I'd say it's a 180. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=95.3s)]
*  I mean, basically what you heard coming from a secretary of state, Rubio, and the other [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=96.82s)]
*  U.S. officials after four and a half hours of meetings with the Russians, which, by the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  way, we haven't seen anything like that since, well, before Russia invaded Ukraine back in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=105.98s)]
*  2022. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=110.78s)]
*  They said that they want the two nations to work more closely together. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=112.22s)]
*  They said they want them to be closer diplomatically, closer economically. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=116.5s)]
*  This is just not the kind of language we have heard from Washington in recent years when [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=120.38000000000001s)]
*  top officials right up to the former president, Joe Biden, viewed Russia as much more of a [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=127.42s)]
*  foe than a partner. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=133.3s)]
*  President Trump has long made it clear that he views Russia quite differently. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=135.62s)]
*  And even Marco Rubio, who has taken a tougher line against Russia in the past, even he was [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=139.46s)]
*  one of the first to start saying publicly that the only way that this war is truly going [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=146.38000000000002s)]
*  to end is with a negotiated settlement. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=151.46s)]
*  And that's what he now says they are working to achieve pretty quickly, even though there's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=154.02s)]
*  some frustration and perhaps even more than frustration, anger on the part of the Ukrainians [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=158.42000000000002s)]
*  who were left out of at least this set of talks in Saudi Arabia this week and the Europeans [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=164.02s)]
*  who are wondering what they're going to be getting for the billions of dollars that they [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=169.62s)]
*  spent defending Ukraine, wondering when they're going to be invited to sit at the table as [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=173.62s)]
*  well. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=177.78s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=178.78s)]
*  Nancy, of course, you're following so many threads there in Florida. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=179.78s)]
*  Here in the U.S., you have new reporting about cuts at the FAA and an effort by the Trump [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=181.66s)]
*  administration to essentially overhaul and shrink the size of government. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=185.82s)]
*  What can you tell us and what other cuts are you following? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=189.62s)]
*  Yes, one of the challenging things about covering the story, Lindsay, has been that the only [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=193.54000000000002s)]
*  way we can really get a sense of how many people are being cut and who they are is either [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=198.02s)]
*  from sources on the inside or from the unions that represent those workers, because we aren't [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=203.58s)]
*  getting a lot of details from the Trump administration, from Doge run by Elon Musk about how large [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=209.10000000000002s)]
*  in scope these cuts are and what is to come. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=218.66000000000003s)]
*  Interestingly, last night, the transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, perhaps in response [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=222.34s)]
*  to criticism that these cuts are going to weaken safety and security at the FAA, he [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=227.46s)]
*  posted that out of the 45,000 employees at the FAA, fewer than 400 have been cut. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=233.9s)]
*  And he insisted, by the way, that none of the cuts had to do with safety and security, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=243.1s)]
*  nothing that would make aviation less safe. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=249.66s)]
*  We did interview Lindsay, a young woman who had just gone to work at the FAA about two [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=251.7s)]
*  and a half months ago. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=256.9s)]
*  She was working as an aviation safety assistant at Dallas, Fort Worth, helping to file reports [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=258.02s)]
*  and inspections on the American Airlines fleet. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=265.5s)]
*  She said that she thought as a result of what she does that she and her colleagues would [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=267.65999999999997s)]
*  be in the clear when the cuts came. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=274.3s)]
*  But she was not. She was let go on Friday. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=277.21999999999997s)]
*  Take a listen to what she had to say. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=280.02s)]
*  I personally did not feel that our positions were at risk for the simple fact that we are [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=281.78s)]
*  in the flight standards safety division. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=287.02s)]
*  It says its name, right? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=290.97999999999996s)]
*  Flight and safety. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=292.38s)]
*  One of the frustrating things for her, her name is Monica, she didn't want us to use [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=296.78s)]
*  her last name, is that when she got her dismissal letter, it cited poor performance as a [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=300.78s)]
*  reason that she was being let go. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=306.41999999999996s)]
*  But she told us she hasn't gotten any performance review yet, reviews yet. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=308.3s)]
*  She's only been on the job for two and a half months. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=312.26s)]
*  And what employment lawyers tell us is that this is a rationale that is being used [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=315.46000000000004s)]
*  frequently by the Trump administration, because it's really the only way that you can [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=319.86s)]
*  let go people who are on probationary status, basically new employees in the federal [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=324.58000000000004s)]
*  government. You can't say we decided we don't need you anymore. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=329.26s)]
*  You can only let them go if there's some kind of misconduct or poor performance involved. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=332.34000000000003s)]
*  And so that's what a lot of these workers are erroneously, in some cases being told. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=337.46s)]
*  Yeah, we're already hearing some of the unions that represent these workers push back on [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=341.09999999999997s)]
*  that. Nancy Cortez, thank you. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ntgGqL3gxM&t=344.26s)]
