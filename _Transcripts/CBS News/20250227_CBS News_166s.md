# Vatican on Pope Francis' complex conditions, oxygen therapy
**CBS News:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q)
*  And we have an update now on the condition of Pope Francis. The Vatican [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=0.0s)]
*  says the Holy Father is continuing to improve, but he's not out of the woods [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=3.02s)]
*  yet. Seth Donne is live at ST Peter's Square with the latest on his [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=7.24s)]
*  condition. Seth, how is the pope doing? What's the latest update from the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=11.32s)]
*  Vatican? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=14.84s)]
*  Well, as you mentioned, another slight improvement tonight. Liz, this is the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  third day in a row where we've not heard anything new or particularly alarming [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=22.76s)]
*  these slight improvements. So the Vatican tonight saying it is still too [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=27.32s)]
*  early to give a prognosis. More time is needed and noting that his situation [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=31.36s)]
*  is medical clinical picture is still quite complex. That's something that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=36.88s)]
*  they've been saying all along. They keep saying guarded prognosis. More time [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=40.84s)]
*  is needed. They won't say whether things will go one way or another. They [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=44.92s)]
*  did add one small detail tonight that he is getting this high flow oxygen. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  That's something that we've been hearing in the last several days. But [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=53.68s)]
*  tonight we learned that he's at times using event in mask, which is one of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=56.84s)]
*  those masks they had mentioned before. It was the tubes that were used in the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=61.68s)]
*  nose. And now a mask is also being alternated in administering this. So [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=66.16s)]
*  encouraging news, but with a caution. And that's what we have been hearing. We [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=71.4s)]
*  earlier in the week got the update that that cat scan that he had had was not [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=77.24s)]
*  alarming doctors. They had said it was showing the normal progression of a [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=81.36s)]
*  pulmonary issue inflammation like he is having. And also you might remember [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=86.63999999999999s)]
*  earlier in the week they had mentioned that early a kidney failure and doctors [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  have been monitoring that and so far have not raised alarm. They say that is [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  not something that they were concerned about. We heard also that the pope was [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=98.96s)]
*  eating this morning that he was able to sit up in his chair. We heard in the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  latest update, he was able to get to the little chapel that's on the 10th floor [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=106.56s)]
*  of his papal suite there where he is being treated at Jamele Hospital in Rome. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=110.56s)]
*  So overall an encouraging update tonight. Yeah. And another encouraging [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=114.88s)]
*  update that we've been hearing off and on this week, Seth, is that he's [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=118.64s)]
*  actually been able to carry out some of his duties while he's in the hospital. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=121.56s)]
*  Yeah, we saw him. We know he met with Cardinal Parolin, the number two, the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=128.7s)]
*  secretary of state earlier in the week as they were starting the path towards [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=133.0s)]
*  for a number of people. The Vatican really has been saying he's been [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=137.76s)]
*  carrying out his work activities on most days, making a point really to show [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=142.0s)]
*  that the church is still moving forward. Every day we get these reports that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=146.68s)]
*  show the nominations of a different priest or archbishop here or there. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  These still continue to come out. The church really making an effort to say [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=154.0s)]
*  the business of the church is carrying on under Francis. Seth Don't lie for us [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  from Rome. Thank you so much, Seth, for that update. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBzROqhSn7Q&t=162.6s)]
