# Judge temporarily blocks 2,200 USAID workers from being put on leave
**CBS News:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w)
*  Hello, everyone. I'm Major Garen in Washington. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight on America Decides, Steel, Steel, Steel. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=2.3000000000000003s)]
*  No, no, no, not that old one. It's a different one. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=5.7s)]
*  Japan's prime minister made a whirlwind trip to Washington, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=8.58s)]
*  and President Trump tap-danced while he was here [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=11.620000000000001s)]
*  around a possible deal between Japan's Nippon Steel [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=14.22s)]
*  and U.S. Steel. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=17.96s)]
*  Here is what the president said in part. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=19.32s)]
*  Nissan's going to be doing something very exciting [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=21.66s)]
*  about U.S. Steel. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=24.82s)]
*  They'll be looking at an investment [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=27.36s)]
*  rather than a purchase. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=28.94s)]
*  We didn't like the idea. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  U.S. Steel is a very important company to us. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=31.18s)]
*  To clarify for the president, Nippon, not Nissan. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=36.18s)]
*  Meanwhile, Republican tension. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  As Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=41.18s)]
*  struggles to make headway on the president's, quote, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=43.32s)]
*  one big, beautiful bill, in the Senate, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=46.46s)]
*  Republican Committee chair of the Budget Committee, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=49.66s)]
*  Lindsey Graham, has released details [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=51.900000000000006s)]
*  of that chamber's two-part plan. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=54.36s)]
*  There's a Senate dinner tonight in Florida, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=57.66s)]
*  and the question that looms over that is, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=60.3s)]
*  can President Trump get most Republicans in both chambers [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=62.0s)]
*  on the same legislative page? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=66.16s)]
*  We'll find out. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=67.96s)]
*  Plus, Musk's next target, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=69.14s)]
*  could the Department of Government Efficiency, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=71.1s)]
*  as it's come to be known, set its sight in some way or another [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=73.28s)]
*  on the data at the Social Security Administration? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=76.88s)]
*  What the president says about this potential move [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=80.52s)]
*  and how it might impact those [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=83.08s)]
*  who receive Social Security benefits. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=84.88s)]
*  We start tonight with Ed O'Keefe and Caitlin Huey-Burns. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=87.3s)]
*  Ed is at the White House. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=89.94s)]
*  Caitlin's on Capitol Hill. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=90.84s)]
*  Ed, this happens a lot. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=91.94s)]
*  I just got handed a sheet of paper with new news [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=94.54s)]
*  about the federal workforce [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=97.08s)]
*  and an intercession by a D.C. federal judge. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=99.72s)]
*  Let me read it to you, and then we'll discuss. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=104.66s)]
*  Federal judge has ordered a temporary restraining order. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=105.9s)]
*  For you legal beagles out there, that's a TRO. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=108.16s)]
*  We're probably gonna hear that phrase, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=110.3s)]
*  that acronym invoked more than once in the next few weeks. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=111.86s)]
*  This temporary restraining order would block 2,200 employees [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=115.17999999999999s)]
*  from being put on administrative leave. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=119.72s)]
*  He will decide later tonight about the fate [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=122.66s)]
*  of 500 federal employees already on leave. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=124.66s)]
*  And I note this in our note about this information, Ed. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=127.86s)]
*  The judge pushed back on the government's, quote unquote, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=131.6s)]
*  findings that there is corruption and fraud, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=135.1s)]
*  as alleged by the President of the United States. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=138.7s)]
*  The government attorneys had no response. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=140.9s)]
*  What can we make of this particular legal development? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=146.02s)]
*  That once again, a move made by the Trump administration [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=150.46s)]
*  in its first 17 days back on the job [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=155.26s)]
*  has been at least temporarily paused by a judge. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=157.96s)]
*  We should point out, by the way, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=161.3s)]
*  this judge was a Trump appointee here in Washington [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=162.8s)]
*  who ruled this way, saying, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=166.1s)]
*  you're not giving me enough information [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=167.5s)]
*  to justify doing this tonight, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=169.34s)]
*  and not enough information as to why [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=171.34s)]
*  it has to happen so quickly. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=172.9s)]
*  What's telling here is this appears to be headed [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=175.1s)]
*  towards a conversation in the legal space [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=177.84s)]
*  about what constitutes fraud versus what is potential waste [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=180.29999999999998s)]
*  or abuse versus what's just a spending decision [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=184.68s)]
*  that's not aligned with the current administration. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=188.22s)]
*  You know, the new administration could have come in [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=191.38s)]
*  and looked at all of these different programs [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=193.46s)]
*  that were underway and said, let's not do these ones, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=195.12s)]
*  let's focus on these ones instead. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=198.32s)]
*  In fact, Secretary of State, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=199.85999999999999s)]
*  and apparently acting USAID Administrator, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=201.58s)]
*  Marco Rubio, earlier this week, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=203.98s)]
*  as part of his trip to Central America, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=205.22s)]
*  told a bunch of US Embassy's personnel in Guatemala [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=207.18s)]
*  that if you've got programs that are aligned [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=210.36s)]
*  with the goals of curbing illegal immigration, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=212.06s)]
*  curbing the drug trade, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=214.4s)]
*  boosting democracies in this part of the world, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=216.22s)]
*  bring them to me and those ones are likely to continue. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=219.0s)]
*  Republicans over the last several days [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=222.34s)]
*  have cited all sorts of examples of USAID funding [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=224.24s)]
*  that went in modest sums, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=228.38s)]
*  in some cases just five figures, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=230.0s)]
*  to help fund theatrical production in Ireland [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  that might have promoted Irish-American unity [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=236.34s)]
*  and diversity, equity, inclusion. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=239.14s)]
*  Okay, that's an example of soft power, certainly, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=241.14s)]
*  but given the DEI component may be something [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=244.78s)]
*  the Trump administration's not a fan of, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=246.98s)]
*  does that constitute or does that give reason [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=249.06s)]
*  to close the entire agency? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=250.98s)]
*  The judge is asking that question now. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=252.29999999999998s)]
*  Is that why you're doing this? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=254.26s)]
*  And it sounds like, at least initially here, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=256.26s)]
*  the Justice Department lawyers [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=258.36s)]
*  didn't have a good enough argument. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=259.4s)]
*  The good news, if you're a USAID employee [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=260.59999999999997s)]
*  or someone who's married to or lives with or knows [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=262.8s)]
*  one of them, they still have a job as of tonight, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=267.64s)]
*  whether they will for the foreseeable future [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=271.68s)]
*  remains to be seen, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=273.92s)]
*  but a lot of what they're trying to do here [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=275.32s)]
*  is being questioned by federal courts [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=277.76s)]
*  and the Trump administration knew this [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=280.52s)]
*  and is inviting the legal challenges [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=282.98s)]
*  and wants to have them in court [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=284.8s)]
*  and inevitably judges will decide here [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=287.04s)]
*  in the coming months or years [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=289.20000000000005s)]
*  whether or not this stuff is legal. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  And there's a legal question about appropriations [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=292.06s)]
*  from Congress and separation of powers. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=294.04s)]
*  We won't get into all that, Ed, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  but I want to talk to you about what just an hour ago [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=297.32s)]
*  probably would have been the first part of our conversation. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=300.0s)]
*  What the president implied, without details, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=302.92s)]
*  is the future of U.S. steel [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=306.16s)]
*  and the Nippon steel acquisition thereof. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=308.04s)]
*  Well, and what he suggested now [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=312.68s)]
*  is that there's going to be more investment [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  by Nippon in U.S. steel. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=316.16s)]
*  Not an outright purchase though, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=318.68s)]
*  and it was notable that he did not endorse [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=320.08s)]
*  the idea that that will happen. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=323.12s)]
*  There are real political reasons not to. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=324.74s)]
*  Labor unions in this country are concerned. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=327.2s)]
*  Where they work, like Pennsylvania [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=329.4s)]
*  and some other states, steel workers, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=331.96s)]
*  creates a political sensitivity for this White House. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=335.16s)]
*  So by announcing plans for Japan [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=337.88s)]
*  to be able to invest more is one thing. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=340.12s)]
*  Outright purchase would be another. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=342.04s)]
*  Remember, the Biden administration [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  blocked Nippon from buying U.S. steel. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=345.12s)]
*  It seems for now the president, current president, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=347.16s)]
*  trying to find something in between. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=349.68s)]
*  And the Japanese Prime Minister notably said nothing. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=351.8s)]
*  Caitlin, I want to go to you on Capitol Hill [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=354.72s)]
*  because quite separate from all of this other drama, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=356.2s)]
*  there is the ongoing conversation [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=359.44s)]
*  that is reaching a kind of dramatic crescendo [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=361.32s)]
*  among House and Senate Republicans [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=363.92s)]
*  about how to legislatively proceed on taxes. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=365.8s)]
*  What do we know? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=370.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=370.92s)]
*  Yeah, Major, with all of the executive orders [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=371.92s)]
*  coming from the White House, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=374.2s)]
*  there's been a big question here [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=375.15999999999997s)]
*  about what Congress should and shouldn't, can, cannot do. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  The one thing that they have to do is fund the government. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=380.84s)]
*  First of all, that runs out, money for the government [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=384.2s)]
*  runs out March 14th. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=386.48s)]
*  So they've got to get some kind of continuing resolution [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=387.8s)]
*  or some kind of piece of legislation [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=391.08s)]
*  to fund the government through. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=393.71999999999997s)]
*  We know how difficult that can be. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=395.0s)]
*  Then they also have to set an agenda [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=397.08s)]
*  for the president's legislative priorities. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=400.2s)]
*  Republicans have made clear [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=402.68s)]
*  that they want to use this budget reconciliation process [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=404.0s)]
*  to do that. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=406.68s)]
*  That means that they don't, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=407.52s)]
*  they can overcome a filibuster in the Senate, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=408.88s)]
*  but that is really complicated. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=411.52s)]
*  So basically what's happening here on Capitol Hill [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=413.6s)]
*  is you have Republican leaders meeting with the president. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=416.72s)]
*  You have Senate leaders [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=420.64s)]
*  and the whole entire Senate Republican conference [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=421.88s)]
*  actually down in Mar-a-Lago tonight [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=424.12s)]
*  to have dinner with the president. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=426.08s)]
*  You had yesterday Speaker Johnson [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=427.48s)]
*  and Republican House leaders meeting with the president [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=429.52s)]
*  for over five hours to kind of get into [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=432.32s)]
*  the nitty gritty details on this. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=435.4s)]
*  And that's significant major [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=437.56s)]
*  because Republicans have a majority up here [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=439.12s)]
*  in both chambers, but on the House side, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=442.15999999999997s)]
*  it's kind of a majority in name only almost. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=444.24s)]
*  I mean, it's such a slim margin [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=447.0s)]
*  that they can't afford any defections. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=448.56s)]
*  And so they have to be on the same page with the president [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=451.15999999999997s)]
*  when it comes to their budget priorities [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=454.84s)]
*  and how they want to go legislatively. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=456.64s)]
*  And also they have very little room for error [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=458.64s)]
*  within their own conference on this as well. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=461.08s)]
*  So a lot of talk about this is the time for Congress [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=464.56s)]
*  to insert and exert its power, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=467.96s)]
*  but how they do that still remains an open question. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=470.28s)]
*  That's why you're seeing these meetings [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=473.32s)]
*  and they're wanting to get going. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=474.76s)]
*  Right, before you get the votes, you have to have a plan. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=476.08s)]
*  And right now they don't have the plan [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=477.91999999999996s)]
*  so they don't know how to get the votes. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=479.12s)]
*  You mentioned a possible shutdown on March 15th. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=480.64s)]
*  Speaker Johnson addressed that today [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=483.28s)]
*  in a sort of preliminary call out [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=486.24s)]
*  the Democrats effort rhetorically. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=488.15999999999997s)]
*  Let's take a quick listen. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=489.71999999999997s)]
*  Leader Jeffries and others seem to be trying to set up [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=491.96s)]
*  some sort of government shutdown, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  which I think is very unfortunate. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  We were negotiating in good faith [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  and trying to get the top line number, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=499.91999999999996s)]
*  but so far as I know, they've been sort of unresponsive [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=501.56s)]
*  the last two days or so. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=504.2s)]
*  So, Kayla, that seems to be the next drama. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=506.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and the finger pointing has already begun. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=510.59999999999997s)]
*  So what does that tell you? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=513.12s)]
*  The reality here is that Democrats [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=515.3199999999999s)]
*  don't have a lot of leverage [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=517.88s)]
*  really on anything in Capitol Hill [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=519.96s)]
*  except for when it comes to these sorts of things. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=521.0s)]
*  They know that Republicans can't afford [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=523.16s)]
*  to lose any of their members. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=525.56s)]
*  So they're not willing to provide votes [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=526.92s)]
*  really for anything. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=529.0s)]
*  We also saw that when Speaker Johnson [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=530.16s)]
*  did negotiate with Democrats on a budget bill, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=532.6s)]
*  his own conference didn't like that. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=537.3199999999999s)]
*  Remember, Elon Musk kind of led the charge [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=539.04s)]
*  and blowing that up. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=541.24s)]
*  So they have a very fragile majority. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=542.72s)]
*  Democrats know that, and that's where you're seeing [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=544.8s)]
*  this kind of situation on the brink. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=547.4399999999999s)]
*  But going back to kind of what we've seen [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=549.16s)]
*  from executive order standpoint, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=550.76s)]
*  I mean, there's a big question up here [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=552.36s)]
*  about whether the government has funded [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=553.72s)]
*  some of those buyouts, right, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=556.28s)]
*  that the administration is promising. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=557.64s)]
*  Right, buyouts promised through September, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=560.12s)]
*  funds only available through March 15th. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=562.4s)]
*  Thanks for making that point, reminding us of that. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=565.16s)]
*  Caitlin Huey Burns, Capitol Hill, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=566.92s)]
*  Ed O'Keefe at the White House. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=568.36s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfCp__8t80w&t=569.2s)]
