**CBS News:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4)
*  All right, we're following a developing story out of Rome where Pope Francis is in the hospital. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=0.0s)]
*  The pontiff has been fighting a cough for the past week, but has tried to keep his schedule [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=5.36s)]
*  as much as possible. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=9.36s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News senior foreign correspondent Seth Doan to talk more about this. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Seth, it's good to see you, my friend. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  So what are you hearing about the pope's condition? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=17.16s)]
*  Well, Valad, we know he was admitted to the hospital late morning Rome time today. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=19.04s)]
*  He has been keeping a very full schedule, all of his public, all of his private appointments. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=24.48s)]
*  He was admitted for testing, some testing that needs to be done at the hospital. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=29.54s)]
*  They can do an awful lot at the Vatican where he is, but they need to do a CAT scan and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=33.18s)]
*  some other tests that will be done at the hospital. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=36.98s)]
*  We're told by a Vatican spokesperson to expect the pope to be there for a couple of days. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=39.58s)]
*  He has been keeping this busy schedule. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=44.74s)]
*  We saw him outside presiding at Mass on Sunday and outside Mass. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=46.42s)]
*  It has been kind of chilly in Rome and we've seen him breathless a few times over the last [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=51.66s)]
*  10 days. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=56.2s)]
*  At one point in that Sunday Mass, he had to hand his speech over to an aide to finish [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=57.720000000000006s)]
*  reading. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=64.64s)]
*  That is also something we've seen a couple of times in the last 10 days, but he has been [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=65.64s)]
*  keeping a very busy schedule. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=69.16s)]
*  He's an 88-year-old man who we know has had various lung issues in the past. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  So as you know, to that point, we know that he's had these health concerns over the years, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=77.7s)]
*  Seth. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  When was the last time that he was in the hospital? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=84.96s)]
*  Last he was in the hospital was June of 2023, but that was not a respiratory related. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=88.14s)]
*  He was removing some intestinal scar tissue and having a repair on hernia. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=93.28s)]
*  About three months before that, March of 2023, he was in a Rome hospital for receiving intravenous [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=98.66s)]
*  antibiotics for the treatment of bronchitis. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=107.36s)]
*  November 2023, we know he canceled a trip to Dubai due to an acute respiratory bronchitis [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=112.12s)]
*  issue. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  About a year ago, he was in February 2024, he was in the hospital very briefly just for [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  a couple of hours for some tests. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=126.56s)]
*  But the last time he was really in the hospital was June 2023. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=129.86s)]
*  All right, Seth, the one for us. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=135.08s)]
*  Seth, thank you very much. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=137.6s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNymGkxrAo4&t=138.6s)]
