# Details hazy on deal to release American Marc Fogel from Russian captivity
**CBS News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw)
*  We're also awaiting the possible release of another American detained in Russia following [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=0.0s)]
*  the Kremlin's decision to free school teacher Mark Fogel yesterday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=4.24s)]
*  It's still unclear how that deal was negotiated or what the United States gave in return. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=7.72s)]
*  CBS Morning's press Middle East envoy Steve Whitkoff on whether he met with Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=17.64s)]
*  Well, I don't want to discuss the meetings that happened in Moscow. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=18.64s)]
*  I would only say this. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=21.56s)]
*  A few days ago, we were approached by someone and we felt that we could get Mark Fogel home. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=23.2s)]
*  We spoke to the president about it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=34.2s)]
*  That's top of the list for our president. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  Top of the list is that no Americans are left behind. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=39.76s)]
*  They're all brought home. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  We fight for every one of them. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=43.76s)]
*  And he gave me instructions and I flew over there and thank God we had a good result. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=45.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=51.84s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News White House reporter Aaron Navarro. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=52.34s)]
*  So Aaron, the big question, I note that the Kremlin has said that they will release the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=56.12s)]
*  name or they will tell us who was released from an American jail, what Russian citizen [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=61.88s)]
*  was released when that individual arrives back in Russia. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  We should point out that over the course of prison releases under President Biden, President [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=72.72s)]
*  Trump took the true social to lambaste some of those deals saying that the United States, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=78.84s)]
*  Biden was releasing thugs and criminals. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=83.92s)]
*  That was back in August of 2024 when Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Krascovich was [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=86.28s)]
*  released. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=92.2s)]
*  So we don't have any details yet, but have you learned anything? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=93.2s)]
*  Here's what we know so far, Vlad. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=97.28s)]
*  Steve Witkoff at the White House told reporters that this deal came together in just the past [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  couple of days. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  He mentioned that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, was, quote, instrumental [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=104.8s)]
*  in getting this done and convincing Russia to release Mr. Fogel. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=110.44s)]
*  We know that Witkoff was sent only when this deal seemed close and that he was on the ground [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=114.92s)]
*  in Russia for just a couple of hours. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=120.16s)]
*  And President Trump last night told reporters that there are another American detainees [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=122.84s)]
*  expected to be released today. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=127.8s)]
*  He said they'd be, quote, someone we know of, though we do not know the specific name [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=129.32s)]
*  but plenty of questions left regarding this deal, what was given and just the conversation around it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so I want to read for our viewers what Donald Trump tweeted or posted to True Social [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  back in August of 2024 in the wake of Evan Krascovich's release, only because we don't [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=145.39999999999998s)]
*  have any details yet about this prisoner swap with Russia. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=150.27999999999997s)]
*  Here's what the president wrote. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  So when are they going to release the details of the prisoner swap with Russia? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  How many people do we get versus them? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=157.88s)]
*  Are we paying them cash? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=160.04s)]
*  Are they giving us cash? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=161.88s)]
*  Are we releasing murderers, killers or thugs? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=163.44s)]
*  Just curious because we never make good deals. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=166.24s)]
*  So it'll be interesting, Aaron, to see who this individual is and how that holds up to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=167.72s)]
*  the president's track record of going against some of the prison releases that we've seen [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=172.76s)]
*  in the past. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=177.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, he signed this executive order that empowers Elon Musk and the White House [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=178.12s)]
*  Department of Government Efficiency, or DOJ, to slash the federal workforce. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=182.72s)]
*  Elon Musk appeared in the Oval Office, as you know, yesterday, Aaron, with the president [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  sitting at the resolute desk. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=191.68s)]
*  Elon Musk there with his son. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  There was a curious exchange when he was asked about some of the claims that he has made, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=194.48s)]
*  because as you know, Aaron, he's provided no proof for what he has said to reporters [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=198.28s)]
*  or what he has posted on X. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=203.12s)]
*  When he was asked about a controversial statement he made about condoms being given out in the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=205.28s)]
*  Middle East, he said that, well, sometimes we're going to make mistakes. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  So the question is, how many mistakes are they making, given that there seems to be [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=212.6s)]
*  no evidence to some of the things that he's suggesting? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=217.28s)]
*  Yeah, him, Elon Musk, and President Trump also made a claim that USAID employees, that's [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=220.28s)]
*  the agency that DOJ has kind of worked to dismantle, are getting kickbacks, that there [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=225.16s)]
*  are federal workers who are making millions of dollars, seemingly, on the side. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  But as you mentioned, no clear evidence has been provided. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=233.56s)]
*  What we have seen on the DOJ X account is sort of these victory laps, kind of listing [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=237.88s)]
*  out some of the contracts that have been terminated in some of these federal agencies, whether [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=242.84s)]
*  that is constituted as waste versus fraud. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=247.96s)]
*  They're not really clarifying. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=251.24s)]
*  Certainly, a lot of focus has been on DEI, which is something that Elon Musk and President [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=252.76s)]
*  Trump disagree with, whether that is something that is fraud is a whole other thing. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=257.28s)]
*  The executive order that President Trump signed, as you mentioned, which is kind of the main [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=262.76s)]
*  reason that Elon Musk, that was the first time we saw him since election day, it essentially [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=266.88s)]
*  emboldens those on paper to make these large scale reductions in force across every federal [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=271.2s)]
*  agency and also says that any hiring in these agencies should be only limited to, quote, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=276.88s)]
*  essential personnel. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=281.79999999999995s)]
*  All right, Aaron Navarro for us this morning. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=284.35999999999996s)]
*  Thank you, Aaron. Appreciate it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeaR03KgBw&t=286.0s)]
