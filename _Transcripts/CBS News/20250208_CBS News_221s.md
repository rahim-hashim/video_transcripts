# Trump appoints controversial NOAA head
**CBS News:** [February 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4)
*  This week, President Trump nominated Dr. Neil Jacobs, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=0.0s)]
*  an atmospheric scientist, to lead the National Oceanic [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=3.0s)]
*  and Atmospheric Administration, better known as NOAA. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  In Trump's first term, Jacobs was the agency's acting leader [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=9.6s)]
*  during what turned into a political storm. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=13.32s)]
*  Jacobs was reprimanded for ethics violations [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=15.84s)]
*  during what became known as Sharpie Gate. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=18.68s)]
*  National environmental correspondent David Schechter [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  investigates what can happen when an administration [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=23.52s)]
*  politicizes science. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=26.76s)]
*  What is important about a hurricane warning? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=29.76s)]
*  People's lives are on the line. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=32.8s)]
*  In September of 2019, during President Donald Trump's first term, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=34.52s)]
*  Craig McLean was the acting chief scientist [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=38.8s)]
*  at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=41.56s)]
*  It runs the National Weather Service, which issues hurricane warnings. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  Dorian has been pummeling the Bahamas for a day and a half. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=49.16s)]
*  On a Sunday, the Weather Service forecasted the storm [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=52.32s)]
*  to move up the Atlantic coast. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=55.56s)]
*  President Trump tweeted that Alabama was in the storm's path, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=57.56s)]
*  but it wasn't. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=60.96s)]
*  20 minutes later, the National Weather Service in Alabama [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=62.24s)]
*  accurately tweeted, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=65.16s)]
*  Alabama will not see any impacts from Dorian. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=66.44s)]
*  That contradicted the president. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=70.08s)]
*  By Wednesday, with Dorian still approaching, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=72.2s)]
*  Trump held up a seven-day-old map altered with a black marker, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=74.72s)]
*  making it look like Alabama was in the hurricane's path. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=78.64s)]
*  The controversy became known as Sharpie Gate. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=82.08000000000001s)]
*  That was the original chart, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=84.72000000000001s)]
*  and you see it was going to hit not only Florida, but Georgia. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=87.76s)]
*  It was going toward the Gulf. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  By Friday, without McLean's knowledge, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=93.92s)]
*  the leadership at NOAA released a statement backing Trump [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=96.28s)]
*  and criticizing the work of the weather forecasters. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  To have a political process unplug the public's trust, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=103.2s)]
*  that got me stirred. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=107.84s)]
*  That gave me a sense of rage. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  McLean demanded investigations. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  They concluded that the statement was driven by external political pressure [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  through a request from the White House then-acting chief of staff, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=120.48s)]
*  and that Neil Jacobs, the head of NOAA, who's been nominated again, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  violated NOAA's scientific integrity policy. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  McLean requested NOAA's top leaders acknowledge the investigative findings. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=131.44s)]
*  Shortly after, he was relieved of his position. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=135.96s)]
*  Jacobs has not responded to our request for a comment, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=139.44s)]
*  and a spokesperson for NOAA says it does not comment on nominations. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=142.32s)]
*  The blanket that was given to me by my team... [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=145.76s)]
*  McLean stayed on with NOAA in another position and eventually retired. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=148.72s)]
*  But big picture, NOAA's science is about more than hurricane warnings. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=153.12s)]
*  It underpins how corporations and insurance companies [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=157.2s)]
*  predict the ever-growing risks of climate disasters [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=160.28s)]
*  and helps farmers choose the best time to plant as weather patterns shift. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=163.56s)]
*  But Project 2025, which has served as a roadmap for the new administration, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=167.68s)]
*  calls on Trump to break up NOAA, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=172.28s)]
*  accusing it of being one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=174.0s)]
*  We reached out to the Trump White House, but it did not respond to our questions. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=178.96s)]
*  And during the nomination hearings for Howard Lutnick, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=182.76s)]
*  Trump's pick to leave the Commerce Department, which oversees NOAA, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=185.08s)]
*  he said he does not support breaking it up. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=188.08s)]
*  Project 2025 is saying NOAA is alarmist. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=190.48s)]
*  Well, we're required by law to give the full picture. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=193.44s)]
*  And if there's a reason to not be alarmist, what is that? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=197.16s)]
*  What we're seeing is alarming, is very alarming. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=203.56s)]
*  McLean says we should all be alarmed by any threats to the integrity of the science [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=206.92s)]
*  that supports what we know about our changing climate. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  Going through that again is very concerning to me. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=214.44s)]
*  For CBS Saturday Morning, David Schechter, Washington. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDNb_paPE4&t=217.07999999999998s)]
