# 1 week left for Congress to avoid government shutdown
**CBS News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A)
*  Meanwhile on Capitol Hill lawmakers now have just one week to agree on a spending plan to avoid a government shutdown [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=0.0s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson said the details could be released as soon as today [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=7.68s)]
*  CBS News senior congressional correspondent Nicole Killian is tracking this for us and joins us live from Capitol Hill [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=11.68s)]
*  So Nicole, what do we know? I know this morning when we spoke you said we haven't seen the text yet [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=17.42s)]
*  We don't know the details when might we get a glimpse? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=22.76s)]
*  Yeah, we're kind of still in that same holding pattern right now arrow [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=26.44s)]
*  But we have a pretty good idea of what this might be [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=29.96s)]
*  House Republicans had said earlier in the week that they were leaning towards a putting forth a year-long CR or continuing resolution [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  Which would be a short-term funding package, which ideally that is not the route that they wanted to go [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=40.82s)]
*  You know [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=46.44s)]
*  There have been appropriators on both sides of the Capitol that have been trying to reach a broader [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=46.84s)]
*  Spending deal on a top-line spending to fund a government agencies through a process called regular order where he passed 12 separate [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=51.64s)]
*  Appropriations bills, but those negotiations have kind of stalled out. Although most recently we were told they were pretty close [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=59.8s)]
*  So this really in terms of a spending plan would just be a patch to kind of keep government [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=66.84s)]
*  Agencies funded at current levels through the end of the fiscal year [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=73.32s)]
*  Let's speak about the latest on the Doge cuts [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=77.60000000000001s)]
*  We know we had this week's announcement about cutting thousands of jobs at the VA and that seems to have really sparked a backlash [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=81.0s)]
*  Among lawmakers even Republicans who have a lot of veteran supporters who they make promises to what's the latest there? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=88.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's right [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=97.64s)]
*  Well, probably some of the sharpest reaction came from Kansas Senator Jerry Moran who heads the Senate VA committee [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=98.58000000000001s)]
*  Who acknowledged, you know the need to downsize but he also pointed out that it should be done in a more responsible manner [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=105.18s)]
*  And so that is the sentiment of some congressional Republicans [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=112.98s)]
*  However, I would note, you know when Elon Musk was here on Capitol Hill when that word came down about those VA cuts [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  There were many House Republicans in particular who? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=122.98s)]
*  Defended the cuts there were some people who told me look, you know, we want to see more details [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=127.02000000000001s)]
*  But there were others who said, you know, look if that's what needs to happen to kind of make the agency more efficient [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=131.38s)]
*  So be it even if these are veterans, you know [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=138.3s)]
*  one person I talked to was Marjorie Taylor Green of Georgia who heads the house doge subcommittee and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=142.14000000000001s)]
*  She told me that you know [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=149.58s)]
*  She is confident in the secretary's ability to make these types of decisions with respect to personnel [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=151.42000000000002s)]
*  And she said with or without these employees she feels that the Department of Veterans Affairs needs to do a better job [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=158.14s)]
*  So she felt that you know [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=164.77999999999997s)]
*  If you need to cut people to make the department more efficient and better and do more for veterans than she was all for it [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=166.66s)]
*  But yes [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=172.85999999999999s)]
*  There are many who feel this might have been a bridge too far and hope that the agency walks it back [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=173.38s)]
*  All right. We'll see what develops Nicole Killian with the latest. Thanks so much [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wmS7DQAu9A&t=179.61999999999998s)]
