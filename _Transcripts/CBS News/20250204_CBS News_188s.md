*  Kennedy's approval had seemed uncertain following his tense confirmation hearings last week. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=25.48s)]
*  Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana appeared skeptical of Kennedy's views on vaccines. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=29.84s)]
*  Cassidy, who is a doctor, ultimately decided to support him. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=35.04s)]
*  We need a leader at HHS who will guide President Trump's agenda to make America healthy again. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=38.48s)]
*  Based on Mr. Kennedy's assurances on vaccines and his platform to positively influence Americans' [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=45.12s)]
*  health, it is my consideration that he will get this done. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=51.08s)]
*  Also on Tuesday, the Senate Intelligence Committee advanced Tulsi Gabbard's nomination to be [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=59.08s)]
*  director of national intelligence, despite some lawmakers' concerns about her past comments [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=62.8s)]
*  on Russia, Syria and foreign surveillance. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=67.32s)]

*  The Iraq War veteran and former Georgia congressman was confirmed on a 77 to 23 vote. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=72.88s)]
*  Collins has promised to make sweeping regulatory cuts to the department and says he plans to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=78.44s)]
*  prioritize veteran health care. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=82.44s)]
*  For more, let's bring in CBS News congressional reporter Torian Smalls. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=84.52s)]
*  What more do we know about what led to Senator Cassidy's decision to support Kennedy for [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  HHS Secretary? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=94.19999999999999s)]
*  So, Lindsey, coming out of the Senate confirmation hearing for Robert F. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=97.16s)]
*  Kennedy Jr. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  last week, Collins said he had quite a few reservations that gave him pause about the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=101.64s)]
*  future of his confirmation. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  We know coming out of this weekend, he picked up quite a few assurances, not just from [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=109.96s)]
*  Kennedy himself, but from the Trump administration and others in Trump world. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=116.2s)]
*  He faced quite a bit of a pressure campaign from Trump supporters, many of them telling [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=120.84s)]
*  him 2026 isn't too far away. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=126.88s)]
*  He's up for reelection then and he's in a vulnerable seat. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=129.2s)]
*  This is a state that voted by 20 plus points for Donald Trump in 2024. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=132.6s)]
*  So he's facing the threat of being primaried if he did not follow the president's will. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  We asked him about whether or not that played a factor in his decision making. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=145.72s)]
*  He told us, no, he was instead hardened by those what he called intense conversations [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=150.16000000000003s)]
*  that he had with Kennedy, but also with J.D. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=156.68s)]
*  Vance, who's been a bit of a liaison from the White House to Capitol Hill. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=159.28s)]
*  Moving forward, it appears that there stands to be no significant challenges to RFK's [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=163.68s)]
*  confirmation. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=170.8s)]
*  Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Mitch McConnell could all defect, but that would still [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  mean Republicans have the numbers to pass his confirmation through a floor vote. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=179.16s)]
*  Thorin Small on Capitol Hill, thank you. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cm4TmeuFtk&t=184.96s)]
