# How Johnson pulled off a win on his House budget plan
**CBS News:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4)
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson pulled out a major win on Capitol Hill last night, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=0.0s)]
*  advancing what President Trump calls the big, the one big, beautiful bill. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=5.0s)]
*  And that victory, it did not come without chaos, though. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=9.5s)]
*  The vote was initially canceled and members were sent home. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=12.36s)]
*  But then minutes later, they were asked to come back and finish the job. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=15.34s)]
*  You may remember there's these were the key GOP holdouts after many meetings [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=18.8s)]
*  and phone calls with the president. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=23.94s)]
*  The only GOP member to vote no was Congressman Thomas Massey from Kentucky. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=25.8s)]
*  He is the man on the far right of that graphic right there. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  The bill made it through by a razor thin margin of 217 to 215. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  Now, President Donald Trump and Speaker Johnson, they are taking a victory lapse. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=40.32s)]
*  The president calling it a big first step win in a social media post. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=45.36s)]
*  And Speaker Johnson had this message afterwards. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=51.02s)]
*  Let's listen to that. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=54.32000000000001s)]
*  Thank you all for staying on a long night. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=56.0s)]
*  We got it done. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=58.26s)]
*  We had the requisite number of votes to move this process along and now passing [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=59.96s)]
*  the budget budget resolution in the House that will go to the Senate. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=64.84s)]
*  This is the first important step in opening up the reconciliation process. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=68.0s)]
*  We have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but we are going to deliver the American [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=72.06s)]
*  First Agenda. We're going to deliver all of it, not just parts of it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=75.66s)]
*  And this was the first step in that process. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=78.86s)]
*  And on that note, CBS News, congressional reporter Torian Small, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=81.34s)]
*  rather, joins us now, Torian. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=84.98s)]
*  Thank you again for being with us today. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=86.34s)]
*  Again, this was the first step in the process and it was not very easy for them [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=89.02s)]
*  to get this through. It took quite a while, you know, going back and forth and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=94.44s)]
*  sending people home, telling them to come back. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=97.28s)]
*  So what happens next here? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=99.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we have to talk about the drama that was the House floor yesterday. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=103.88s)]
*  I mean, like you said, at one point, members left. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=108.14s)]
*  We saw members getting cars. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=112.46000000000001s)]
*  Those cars turned back around because it was clear that Speaker Johnson had the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=114.3s)]
*  votes. But ultimately, like you said, just narrowly passing with that razor thin [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=118.4s)]
*  margin by one vote. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=123.7s)]
*  They could only afford to lose two Republican votes on this. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=126.1s)]
*  They ultimately got just one to defect. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=128.6s)]
*  And we saw that cross the finish line. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=132.1s)]
*  Now, what's next? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=133.6s)]
*  Well, the two chambers, House Republicans and Senate Republicans, have to meet to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=135.0s)]
*  find some way in the middle because these two bills that were passed in their [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=140.56s)]
*  respective chambers are drastically different. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=145.76s)]
*  I think the biggest differing piece of legislation or instruction in the House bill [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=148.46s)]
*  compared to the Senate version is the fact that the House bill adds about four point [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=154.6s)]
*  five trillion dollars to the deficit because it includes an extension of Trump's [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=159.6s)]
*  twenty seventeen tax cuts. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=165.34s)]
*  That's what Senate Republicans will now have to look at to mediate in order to get a [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=167.48s)]
*  cohesive bill to the president's desk. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=173.18s)]
*  OK, so Torian, you talked about the tax cuts there. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=176.18s)]
*  Is there anything else in this plan that you can tell us about? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  That's the biggest one. Democrats, though, are concerned about spending cuts that could [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=184.92s)]
*  potentially take away or at least do damage to some safety net programs in this budget [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=190.18s)]
*  resolution that was just passed by the House. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=196.51999999999998s)]
*  Republican leadership are calling on specific committees, so namely the House [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  Energy and Commerce Panel, to cut around eight hundred eighty billion dollars in [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=205.22s)]
*  mandatory spending. Democrats are saying, look at this, if you do the math, there [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=210.98s)]
*  aren't too many other programs in there purview that could get them to that number. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=214.98s)]
*  The biggest one by far is Medicaid. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=219.38s)]
*  So they believe that Republicans are hinting at cutting that very crucial program. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=221.68s)]
*  I also press Senate leadership or Republican leadership about this and other Republicans. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=227.52s)]
*  And I said, maybe it is time to look at reforming the program. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=231.62s)]
*  They've laid out a case in their minds of waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=234.72s)]
*  And they say that it wouldn't hurt to make some cuts to that program. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=238.66s)]
*  OK, we'll see what comes out of that moving forward. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=242.08s)]
*  Torian, also on Capitol Hill yesterday, federal workers going door to door in [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=244.76000000000002s)]
*  protest and now Republicans are urging decisions about firing civil servants be [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=249.68s)]
*  placed in the hands of cabinet secretaries and not doge. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=254.16s)]
*  What else can you tell us about that? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=258.82s)]
*  Yeah, not too many in the conference, I should say, are willing to come out and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=262.68s)]
*  publicly oppose these very public and very aggressive cuts to these departments. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  But quite a few are expressing concerns and talking internally to the White House [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=274.72s)]
*  about how to move forward with this. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=279.52s)]
*  Lisa Murkowski, the senator from Alaska, brought up the fact that she just had a [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=281.52s)]
*  town hall where 30 or a thousand of her constituents complained to her about what [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=287.0s)]
*  these cuts mean and how it's impacting her home state. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=293.7s)]
*  She also has by far the largest number of federal workers per capita. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  So she's directly impacted by these sweeping cuts. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=303.32s)]
*  Congresswoman Malik Mala, take us. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=307.24s)]
*  Sorry for mispronouncing that a long night yesterday. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=311.6s)]
*  But the New York congresswoman also said that doge cuts should probably be left to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=314.32s)]
*  the hands of these appointees by the president. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=320.52s)]
*  She doesn't necessarily agree with them. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  She's not going as far as saying she disagrees with them considering she's on the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  doge caucus in the House, but says that it's probably time to let the appointees, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=329.4s)]
*  the confirmed cabinet members, take over handling of how to treat their staff. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=335.2s)]
*  All right. Yeah, certainly a long night last night, Tori and small. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=340.4s)]
*  So we do appreciate you making the time for us on the stream today. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=343.28s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVeJyp2-e4&t=346.2s)]
