# Backlash to Trump's Gaza comments, White House clarifies president's remarks, more | CBS News 24/7
**CBS News:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk)
*  Welcome in everybody. All eyes on the White House press briefing room and the podium [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=0.0s)]
*  where reporters will send quite a few questions to the press secretary, Caroline Levitt. So [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=10.84s)]
*  a little bit of news deconstructed for you. Headline after headline in recent days, not [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=15.36s)]
*  the least of which what to make of President Donald Trump's mention of the U.S. potentially [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=19.8s)]
*  taking over the Gaza Strip and moving the people out of Gaza. So we've got a couple [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=24.2s)]
*  of cameras here on various views. This is sort of a little look behind the scenes of [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=28.42s)]
*  what we're talking about here. First camera, of course, on the podium. And then, of course, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=33.980000000000004s)]
*  the camera on the question, the people who will be asking the questions. We've got cameras [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=38.38s)]
*  on them as well. Questions reveal us. And so we want to see the people asking the questions [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=42.74s)]
*  as much as we want to see Ms. Levitt, who is answering the questions. So we are there. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=47.82000000000001s)]
*  We're going to be there as soon as she takes to the podium right now. But as we can show [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=52.44s)]
*  you, reporters are just getting ready. So just think about this. We're just three weeks [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=57.28s)]
*  into the Trump presidency. And as always, there's a lot to keep track of a storm of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=60.58s)]
*  executive actions, executive orders, and of course, the lawsuits that followed. Strong [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=65.54s)]
*  reaction also pouring in from across the world. In fact, this comment, though, sure to dominate [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  the questions in today's briefing. Listen what the president said. The U.S. will take [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=76.16s)]
*  You heard the reaction there in the room. So meantime, we are keeping a close eye on [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=111.92s)]
*  the podium right now. We'll bring you the very latest from the White House press briefing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=116.92s)]
*  room as soon as that begins. Of course, we're anticipating a lot of questions on how this [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=120.66s)]
*  would work. So on Capitol Hill, reaction to President Trump's proposal to take over Gaza, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=124.9s)]
*  taking over the headlines. Democrats slamming the move as, quote, horrific. Republicans [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=129.78s)]
*  call the proposal a good development. Here's Senator John Fetterman taking a different [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  approach than some of his Democratic colleagues. Listen. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=139.5s)]
*  They're just trying to shake things up and just announce like there is some truths about [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=142.14s)]
*  Gaza. How are somebody able to leave there right now when probably 85 to 90 percent or [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=147.82s)]
*  more of the buildings are destroyed or seriously damaged? So where are people going to live [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=153.76s)]
*  and how things are going to go? And how can you rebuild Gaza until Hamas is still allowed [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=158.26s)]
*  to to endure? So there's a lot of questions. And where's the money going to come from? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=163.1s)]
*  So so this is about, I think for me, I didn't take it as like a serious situation and it's [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=168.2s)]
*  just about shaking things up, but I'm not going to freak out on it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=172.82s)]
*  So let's go live to CBS News congressional correspondent Caitlin Huey Burns on the Hill. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=177.32s)]
*  All right. He's not freaking out about it, but we have to ask you because Mike Johnson [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=181.0s)]
*  seems at least open to what the president said about Gaza. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=184.17999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, today he called it a bold move and he seemed to be deferential to the president [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=188.12s)]
*  on this and kind of waiting to see, in his words, what happens specifically here. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=195.28s)]
*  But by and large, you're not seeing Republicans really willing to criticize the president on [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=200.12s)]
*  anything, especially not on this. Now, what's important to note here is that this is a [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=205.16s)]
*  president who ran for years on a non-interventionist kind of foreign policy that this you [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=210.64s)]
*  would imagine would be antithetical to that approach. You also have at the same time the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=217.4s)]
*  president's directive to essentially unwind USAID foreign aid. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  So how does that square with a potential proposal to require more intervention in the Middle [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  East and not ruling out the use of U.S. military troops on the ground there? So we are monitoring [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  Republican reaction on this specifically because this is a, you know, would represent kind [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  of a fissure within the party on this. But by and large, you're seeing a Republican party [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=246.62s)]
*  pretty deferential to the president wanting to give him time and space here. But again, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=251.70000000000002s)]
*  how does that challenge their long held beliefs? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=257.62s)]
*  Well, speaking of Republican party wanting to give deference and time and space, let's [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=260.3s)]
*  talk about the president's picks for confirmation. Tulsi Gabbard, RFK Jr., they cleared the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=264.66s)]
*  hurdles yesterday out of committee. So now what happens there? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=270.7s)]
*  Yeah, big procedural hurdles that yesterday was really the question about the fates of [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=275.18s)]
*  these two controversial nominees and the idea that they got through committee gets them [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=280.3s)]
*  obviously a step closer to full confirmation by the Senate, but remove some of those wildcards [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=286.38000000000005s)]
*  or questions about whether they could actually get there and their teams feeling much more [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=292.5s)]
*  confident in their confirmations. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=297.34000000000003s)]
*  Okay, so never never at a loss for headlines these days, we want to get to this congressional [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=300.14s)]
*  Congressman Al Green gave a passionate speech on the House floor calling for the impeachment [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=306.06s)]
*  of President Trump. We want to let our viewers hear what was said there and then ask you [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=311.09999999999997s)]
*  about it. So listen, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=314.62s)]
*  I rise to announce that the movement to impeach the president has begun. I rise to announce [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=316.78s)]
*  that I will bring articles of impeachment against the president for desperately deeds [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=325.90000000000003s)]
*  proposed and desperately deeds done. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=332.58000000000004s)]
*  All right, so of course he is reacting to the news of what came out of that news conference [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=338.02000000000004s)]
*  with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding the U.S. potentially taking over the Gaza [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=342.58000000000004s)]
*  Strip. What kind of legs can this have? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=346.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, you have to consider who it's coming from. Al Green has proposed impeaching President [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=349.22s)]
*  Trump several times, especially in his first administration. So this is nothing new. I [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=357.06s)]
*  don't think this has much many legs here on Capitol Hill because of who it's coming from. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=362.58000000000004s)]
*  The bigger question is how do Democrats counter the president and his proposals and his use [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=368.18s)]
*  of executive authority especially? I mean, Democrats up here are in the minority. They [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=374.86s)]
*  have limited tools to go after some of these things that they're seeing coming from the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=379.26s)]
*  White House, but they have very little leverage to do it. On the Senate side, there is an [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=384.53999999999996s)]
*  effort to stall the confirmation processes for his nominees, for example, but there is [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=389.34s)]
*  this broader question about what Democrats can actually do countering this administration. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=395.82s)]
*  A lot of it will be through messaging. Just outside here, there is a big protest of USAID [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=401.5s)]
*  workers trying to send a message that way. There are going to be lots of legal fights as well. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=407.9s)]
*  I wouldn't put too much stock in this declaration for impeachment because it's been done a lot from [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=413.02s)]
*  this particular congressman, but that's something that we're looking for is how exactly Democrats [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=420.38s)]
*  counter, whether through messaging or policy, what's coming from this administration, especially [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=425.66s)]
*  when you have that united Republican force around the president essentially ceding some [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=430.62s)]
*  of their power to him, at least at the moment. The pen of history has to write fast. Caitlin [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=437.18s)]
*  Huey-Burns, thank you so much for that update. So we're also following breaking news. President [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=442.06s)]
*  Trump's push to end birthright citizenship has now been blocked. Keep in mind for a second time, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=446.86s)]
*  a federal judge in Maryland ordered a nationwide pause on Trump's executive order. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=452.22s)]
*  In its scathing rebuke, Judge Deborah Boardman said no court in the country has endorsed the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=457.02s)]
*  Trump administration's interpretation of the 14th Amendment and goes on to say this court [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=461.74s)]
*  will not be the first. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi was just sworn in. She takes over the DOJ [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=467.26s)]
*  a day after multiple federal lawsuits were filed by FBI agents and employees who investigated [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=472.78s)]
*  January 6. Now those staff members are trying to stop the public release of their names. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=478.38s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News Justice Department correspondent Scott McFarland. Scott, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=483.98s)]
*  welcome in. Forgive me, we're getting an acute. Okay Scott, you're on the phone. Hello my friend, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=488.78000000000003s)]
*  I was about to turn to a monitor here, but we'll hear from you. So talk to me about Pam Bondi [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=495.1s)]
*  swearing in and what her first actions could be. I'm happy to do so and I always look back, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=499.58000000000004s)]
*  you can't see me. We have Pam Bondi just walking into the Department of Justice, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=503.82s)]
*  the next Attorney General, the new Attorney General, and it's going to be a sea change here. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=508.78000000000003s)]
*  This is somebody who could not be a strike or more striking contrast from Merrick Garland. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=513.5799999999999s)]
*  She's somebody who has defended Trump in his first impeachment trial. She's somebody who has denied [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=518.6999999999999s)]
*  the results of the 2020 election and somebody who has pledged to come in here and end what she calls [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=523.9799999999999s)]
*  the weaponization of the department. But she's coming in here, Reed, amid some turmoil. I mean, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=528.54s)]
*  the FBI right now is going through some rough times. You have 5,000 or so agents and employees [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=534.38s)]
*  who've been named and their names have been handed over to the Department of Justice leadership as [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=540.86s)]
*  being involved with the January 6 investigations. They are concerned about mass firings and [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=545.74s)]
*  resignations because of it and it's not clear what happens next with that list or with this department. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=551.34s)]
*  Any sort of insurance for these FBI agents who are just following orders, Scott? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=559.02s)]
*  So far, a few things have been done to fire at wall this. First of all, the FBI's interim leadership [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=564.5400000000001s)]
*  has handed over the full identities of these agents and employees, but not their names on the [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=571.26s)]
*  list as their employee ID numbers, which presumably, Reed, makes that list more difficult to leak or [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=577.5s)]
*  release and to, as the FBI is concerned, put the agents and employees in danger. But it's not clear [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=583.9000000000001s)]
*  if there's going to be employment actions against any number of them. With the acting deputy attorney [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=590.54s)]
*  general has said he wants this list for consideration of possible employment actions against FBI workers [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=596.78s)]
*  and how many and how far they'll go is far from clear to the agents. That's why two different [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=603.02s)]
*  groups of FBI employees have filed suit against the Department of Justice against their own employers [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=608.86s)]
*  saying their privacy has been invaded, that their due process rights have been violated, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=614.4599999999999s)]
*  and that the court should order that list not be released. So any timeline here, Scott, for when [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=618.06s)]
*  some of this could play out, when we could get some definites? Yep, we expect a court hearing [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=624.54s)]
*  tomorrow morning, 10 30 a.m. Washington D.C. time, where the attorneys for those FBI agents will face [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=629.18s)]

*  the list of agents. Pam Bondi is expected to speak publicly at some point in the next day or two, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=640.4599999999999s)]
*  potentially here from the Department of Justice headquarters, either to the media or to the [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=646.38s)]
*  employees here in the building. Whether she addresses this issue is far from clear. How is [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=650.7s)]
*  this being seen by lawmakers, Scott, on Capitol Hill? You know, we see these issues often split [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=656.9399999999999s)]
*  down party lines, but some lawmakers potentially could see this as Donald Trump following up on a [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=661.82s)]
*  grudge. Others could say, as Donald Trump has said, that he wants to see the FBI clean and above board [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=667.1s)]
*  according to their view. How is it being seen by lawmakers that you're talking to? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=673.26s)]
*  Two different issues. First of all, there are Democrats who think this is an extension of those [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=677.1s)]
*  mass blanket pardon January 6th. That this naming of names of FBI agents who are part of that is [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=682.06s)]
*  part of the whitewashing of history. This villainization of the police who are investigating [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=688.14s)]
*  a violent, horrific crime and potentially could set some of those agents up for retaliation by [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=693.1s)]
*  Trump supporters or even the sympathizers of the rioters themselves. Second issue is process. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=699.02s)]
*  This purge, this potential purge of the FBI began its motions before Pam Ponte was confirmed [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=704.9399999999999s)]
*  as attorney general, before Cash Patel has gotten the vote to be the next FBI director. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=713.02s)]
*  Members of Congress want to know what they knew about this before they took office. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=717.42s)]
*  Wow. Ripples and waves. Scott McFarland, always great to talk to you. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=722.38s)]
*  Next time I want to see you on a monitor, my friend. Take care, friend. Game of telephone today. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=726.22s)]
*  Well, less than 24 hours after a U.S. ban on accepting packages from China and Hong Kong, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=732.38s)]
*  the U.S. Postal Service says they'll now resume normal operations. You keeping track of this? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=736.78s)]
*  This is all about the tariffs and the trade fight between the U.S. and China. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=741.9s)]
*  Now, other than the reversal, no explanation from the USPS other than to say that they're [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=745.58s)]
*  working with customs and border protection to avoid disruptions. Online retailers shine [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=750.62s)]
*  and Tmoo, their popularity is booming. We know this. And perhaps another trade war punch, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=755.82s)]
*  President Trump is considering adding the retailers to the Department of Homeland Security's [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=761.1800000000001s)]
*  forced labor list. It's a list that singles out companies that rely on that forced labor to [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=765.58s)]
*  manufacture its goods. The Trump administration has not made a final decision on this matter, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=771.4200000000001s)]
*  but we'll be watching it closely. Well, you can now add the CIA to President Donald Trump's buyout [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=776.46s)]
*  list. Workers of the Central Intelligence Agency can now join the so-called Deferred Resignation [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=782.06s)]
*  Program. So here's the deal from the federal government. Quit your job and they say that they [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=787.9799999999999s)]
*  will give you eight months' pay and benefits. Civil service employees received the offer last [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=793.8199999999999s)]
*  week, but national security workers were not originally included in that deal. So now, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=798.9399999999999s)]
*  that has changed. However, there are some stipulations on this one. Not all CIA workers [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=804.78s)]
*  are eligible to get that offer. So here's an overview of what the CIA does. Their job [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=809.9s)]
*  is essentially to stop threats before they happen. According to the agency, here's how they do that, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=815.5s)]
*  using foreign intelligence, analysis, and covert action as directed by the president. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=820.78s)]
*  We'll continue watching that. Plus, we're watching those podiums at the White House press briefing [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=827.1s)]
*  room. So many questions directed at the press secretary, Ms. Levitt, regarding what is going [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=831.42s)]
*  to happen in Gaza, one day after President Donald Trump stood shoulder to shoulder with [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=837.34s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and suggested the U.S. could take over Gaza. Where would the [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=841.9s)]
*  citizens of Gaza go? Many questions when we come back. All right, listening live right now to the [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=847.58s)]
*  White House press room, press secretary Caroline Levitt taking questions from reporters. Let's [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=860.94s)]
*  listen in. Foreign entanglements, nation building, sending American troops to fight abroad, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=865.02s)]
*  particularly in the Middle East. This plan seems like it could ultimately involve all of those [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=871.66s)]
*  things. Can you explain this reversal and how building and owning Gaza squares with America [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=876.62s)]
*  first-born policy? I would reject the premise of your question that this forces the United States [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=883.26s)]
*  to be entangled in conflicts abroad. The president has not committed to putting boots on the ground [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=888.9399999999999s)]
*  in Gaza. He has also said that the United States is not going to pay for the rebuilding of Gaza. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=894.22s)]
*  His administration is going to work with our partners in the region to reconstruct this region. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=899.5s)]
*  And let me just take a step back here because this is an out-of-the-box idea. That's who President [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=905.6600000000001s)]
*  Trump is. That's why the American people elected him. And his goal is lasting peace in the Middle [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=911.34s)]
*  East for all people in the region. And as I said in my opening remarks, we've had the same people [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=918.0600000000001s)]
*  pushing the same solutions to this problem for decades. And it's been made very clear to the [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=923.98s)]
*  president that the United States needs to be involved in this rebuilding effort to ensure [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=929.9s)]
*  stability in the region for all people. But that does not mean boots on the ground in Gaza. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=936.22s)]
*  It does not mean American taxpayers will be funding this effort. It means Donald Trump, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=940.62s)]
*  who is the best dealmaker on the planet, is going to strike a deal with our partners in the region. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=944.4599999999999s)]
*  He did not rule out American troops in Gaza last night. Are you doing that now? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=949.18s)]
*  I am saying that the president has not committed to that just yet. He has not made that commitment. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=953.18s)]
*  And you know that. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=957.7399999999999s)]
*  And on the foreign partners, the Jordanians, the Egyptians, the Saudis have already [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=958.38s)]
*  panned this plan. What foreign partners, if any, have expressed any interest in being part of this? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=962.62s)]
*  Well, the president has said he's been socialing this idea for quite some time. He's been thinking [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=967.26s)]
*  about this. He said in his remarks last night this was not a decision or an announcement that [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=971.42s)]
*  he takes lightly. And the president has already spoken to the president, Al Sisi. In fact, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=976.2199999999999s)]
*  that was his first foreign leader call. He's meeting with the king of Jordan, King Abdullah, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=981.66s)]
*  next week. He spoke with the king of Bahrain. He spoke with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=986.2199999999999s)]
*  And he has made it very clear, he's been very vocal, that he expects our partners in the region, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=991.5799999999999s)]
*  particularly Egypt and Jordan, to accept Palestinian refugees temporarily so that we [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=996.62s)]
*  can rebuild their home. I'd like to show you some images of Gaza that were taken. Fox News aired [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1002.06s)]
*  this. I mean, that is, as they put it, an apocalyptic scene in Gaza. This is an [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1008.22s)]
*  unhabitable place for human beings. Do you really think that families can live their dream in a [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1014.3000000000001s)]
*  region that looks like this, with no running water, no electricity? And the special envoy [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1021.58s)]
*  to the president, Steve Witkoff, recently traveled to Gaza, as you all know. And he came back with [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1026.54s)]
*  images that he showed the president of the dire situation here. And the president made this decision [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1031.18s)]
*  with a humanitarian heart for all people in the region. Peter. Thank you, Caroline. Are any [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1037.26s)]
*  officials here preparing to fight democratic lawmakers in the streets? Absolutely not. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1043.66s)]
*  So, and thanks for the question. Some elected Democrats are so steamed about Doge. Congresswoman [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1050.14s)]
*  LaMonica MacGyver says, we are at war. Ilhan Omar says, we might actually see somebody get killed. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1055.82s)]
*  And Chris Van Hollen says, we have to fight this in the Congress. We have to fight this in the [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1062.54s)]
*  streets. So what now? And may I just point out, if you heard that type of violent enticing rhetoric [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1066.06s)]
*  from our side of the aisle, from Republican leaders on Capitol Hill, I think there would be a lot more [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1073.5s)]
*  outrage in this room today. It's unacceptable, the comments that have been made by these Democrat [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1079.02s)]
*  leaders. And frankly, they don't even know what they're talking about. Because President Trump [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1083.82s)]
*  was elected with a mandate from the American people to make this government more efficient. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1088.46s)]
*  He campaigned across this country with Elon Musk, vowing that Elon was going to head up the [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1093.6599999999999s)]
*  Department of Government Efficiency. And the two of them, with a great team around them, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1099.1s)]
*  were going to look at the receipts of this federal government and ensure it's accountable [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1103.4199999999998s)]
*  to American taxpayers. That's all that is happening here. And for Democrat officials [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1107.1799999999998s)]
*  to incite violence and encourage Americans to take to the streets is incredibly alarming. And [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1111.6599999999999s)]
*  they should be held accountable for that rhetoric. It sounds like something that they're most [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1117.5s)]
*  concerned about is Doge engineers with access to treasury systems. Can you clarify, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1120.78s)]
*  do the Doge engineers have read only access in these systems? So they are not allowed to write [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1126.3799999999999s)]
*  new code? They're not. Okay. And then one more thing. NBC is reporting that some of the illegal [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1131.66s)]
*  immigrants that we've seen rounded up and arrested are not being deported. They're being released [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1137.58s)]
*  with ankle or wrist monitoring devices, or they have to check in on the phone. So is the [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1144.3799999999999s)]
*  administration arresting more people than you have room for? I have seen the reports, and I'm [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1149.34s)]
*  glad you brought it up because we want to address it. There have been a total of 461 illegal aliens. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1155.1799999999998s)]
*  This is of this morning when I got this information from DHS that have been released from custody of [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1161.34s)]
*  the more than 8000 that have been arrested since President Trump was inaugurated. It's less than [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1166.78s)]
*  6%. And there are reasons for their release. Some of the factors include a lack of significant [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1172.3799999999999s)]
*  likelihood of removal in the foreseeable future, lack of detention availability, which is something [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1178.22s)]
*  this president and this administration has been incredibly vocal about. We are doing everything we [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1183.18s)]
*  can to deport and detain illegal immigrants, but we need Congress's help to increase funding for [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1188.38s)]
*  border patrol and for ICE to increase detention capability in our facilities. And then other [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1193.9s)]
*  serious medical conditions have also been the reasons for some of the release of these individuals. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1199.82s)]
*  But none of them have final deportation orders. Many of them are probably contesting their [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1203.58s)]
*  immigration status. I'd refer you to DHS for more details, but I did get that information because [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1208.46s)]
*  I knew it would be a question. So thank you. Sure. Yes. The president and you here again today have [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1212.86s)]
*  made clear, given the devastation, you think Palestinians have no choice but to leave Gaza [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1218.86s)]
*  and go elsewhere. But Palestinians say this is their home. They don't want to go. The president [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1222.9399999999998s)]
*  last night said he's willing to use the military if necessary. Is the U.S. prepared to remove [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1227.6599999999999s)]
*  Palestinians from Gaza by force? The president is prepared to rebuild Gaza for Palestinians and all [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1232.46s)]
*  people in the region, peace-loving people who want real economic development and opportunity in the [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1239.02s)]
*  region. This is a region that has been controlled by Iranian-backed terrorists, Hamas, who have [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1245.02s)]
*  brutalized not just Israelis but Palestinians too. It is because of Hamas that you see those [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1250.6200000000001s)]
*  images on that screen, that Gaza has become a demolition site because Hamas launched that brutal [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1255.74s)]
*  attack on Israel on October the 7th. And so again, I would stress, President Trump wants to ensure [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1261.18s)]
*  that this can be a place where all people can live in peace. He is a peacemaker-in-chief. He made that [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1266.94s)]
*  very clear in his first term. And as for how that will be accomplished, the president and his team [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1273.42s)]
*  are talking with our allies in the region to consider next steps. But should the American [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1278.6200000000001s)]
*  people be prepared to see U.S. military on the ground fighting a ground war against Hamas? Again, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1282.7s)]
*  the president has not committed to U.S. troops in the region. But it is an option. I have said that [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1287.42s)]
*  the president has not committed to that yet. Sure. If I could just follow up on that, though, why not rule [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1292.38s)]
*  out the idea of committing U.S. troops? This has been a long-standing argument that the president [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1297.74s)]
*  has made really over the last decade or so, talking about endless wars and not something the U.S. wants. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1303.98s)]
*  Why not rule out troops? Because I think the president is very good when he's making deals [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1308.6200000000001s)]
*  in negotiating not to rule out anything because he wants to preserve that leverage in negotiations. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1312.54s)]
*  And so I think that's what he's doing here. If I could follow up on that, though, he also said [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1319.58s)]
*  that everyone loves this plan. He said that in the Oval Office this morning. In fact, the [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1323.3400000000001s)]
*  deputy prime minister of Jordan called it the declaration of war on the Arab people. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1328.78s)]
*  So how does he square the fact that even some Republicans on the Hill are objecting to this [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1333.26s)]
*  or questioning this? How does he square the fact saying everyone loves this plan? Well, King Abdullah [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1337.98s)]
*  of Jordan will be here next week, so I can provide you more context on the conversations [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1341.82s)]
*  he will have directly with the president of the United States after that meeting. And I would just [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1346.46s)]
*  point out that there's been a lot of leaders and officials all around the world who have [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1350.7s)]
*  doubted, I suppose, the dealmaking ability of President Trump. You heard the Panama [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1354.9399999999998s)]
*  leader saying that he would not agree to some of the concessions that he has now made because of [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1360.78s)]
*  Secretary Rubio's visit. You had the Colombian president saying he wouldn't accept flights of [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1366.1399999999999s)]
*  Colombian illegal nationals who have entered into our country illegally, and those flights [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1370.38s)]
*  are underway. So actions speak louder than words. Dasha. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1374.6200000000001s)]
*  Q You said the president has been working on this idea for a while behind the scenes now. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1378.22s)]
*  Is there a written plan based on the president's proposal for Gaza? And if so, when was it drafted [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1383.1000000000001s)]
*  and who had a hand in that? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1389.18s)]
*  The plan was written in the president's remarks last night as he revealed it to the world and to [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1390.7s)]
*  the American people, and his team are continuing to be engaged on this effort. I saw the national [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1395.1000000000001s)]
*  security adviser this morning. He has a very busy day of calls, and they will, again, continue to [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1400.06s)]
*  engage with our partners. That includes Steve Witkoff as well. Mary. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1404.46s)]
*  Q Two questions for you on the news of the day. So how is today's executive order going to impact [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1407.58s)]
*  the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles? For example, would a man who thinks that he's a [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1413.98s)]
*  transgender woman be allowed to compete as a female on U.S. soil? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1419.6599999999999s)]
*  A It's a very good question, and the president has actually mentioned this, that he does expect the [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1423.6599999999999s)]
*  Olympic Committee and the NCAA to no longer allow men to compete in women's sports. And I think [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1429.1799999999998s)]
*  the president, with the signing of his pen, starts a very public pressure campaign on these [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1436.3799999999999s)]
*  organizations to do the right thing for women and for girls across the country. Again, this is an [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1441.58s)]
*  incredibly popular position. There have been many notable female athletes who have had the courage [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1447.1799999999998s)]
*  to speak out against some very powerful institutions in this country. They deserve to have a voice and [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1452.3s)]
*  say the president is bringing their voice to the highest level at the White House this afternoon, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1456.94s)]
*  and he expects these organizations to comply with this federal executive order that he'll be signing [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1461.18s)]
*  today. Q Thank you. And one more on media coverage of this executive order and the topic in general. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1465.9s)]
*  What's the White House's view of framing that calls men transgender females or similar rhetoric [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1471.74s)]
*  coming from organizations like the ACLU and GLAD? A Well, it's been very clear. The policy of this [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1477.8200000000002s)]
*  administration is that there are only two sexes, male and female. Pretty simple. Brian Glenn. Q USAID [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1483.82s)]
*  has gotten a lot of attention the last couple of days with some of these bizarre things that we've [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1492.7s)]
*  been taxpayers have been funding. Now it looks like there are a couple media outlets that have been [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1498.62s)]
*  dragged into this conversation as far as USAID funding as well. Does the president have any comment on that? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1505.4199999999998s)]
*  So upon coming out here to the briefing room, I was made aware of the funding from USAID to [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1512.7s)]
*  media outlets, including Politico, who I know has a seat in this room. And I can confirm that the [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1520.3s)]
*  more than eight million taxpayer dollars that have gone to essentially subsidizing subscriptions to [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1526.78s)]
*  Politico on the American taxpayers dime will no longer be happening. The Doge team is working on [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1531.4199999999998s)]
*  canceling those payments now. Again, this is a whole of government effort to ensure that we are [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1536.46s)]
*  going line by line when it comes to the federal government's books. And this president and his team [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1542.38s)]
*  are making decisions across the board on do these receipts serve the interests of the American [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1549.42s)]
*  people? Is this a good use of the American taxpayers money? If it is not, that funding will no longer [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1555.74s)]
*  be sent abroad and American taxpayers will see significant savings because of that effort. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1561.9s)]
*  I'd like to give some love to the back row. I've heard that unfortunately they haven't been called [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1567.8200000000002s)]
*  on in years past. So Reagan, why don't you go ahead? Thanks Caroline. The WHCA announced that comedian [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1572.3000000000002s)]
*  Amber Ruffin, who is called the president a toddler with his pants pulled down, will be the [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1578.7s)]
*  entertainment for this year's Correspondents' Dinner. Does the White House have a reaction to this choice [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1583.26s)]
*  and will the president be attending the dinner this year? Certainly an interesting choice. I have [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1587.98s)]
*  the president's invitation on my desk. I have the invitation for myself on my desk as well. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1593.1s)]
*  Haven't talked to the president about it. When he makes his decision, I will let you all know. But [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1597.9s)]
*  definitely an interesting choice of the comedian. I'll talk to the boss about it and see what we [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1602.7s)]
*  decide. Sure, go ahead. Yes. On the executive order said to be signed today, you said that this will [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1606.46s)]
*  be enforced. He's filled out for schools and the public how exactly the administration plans to [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1613.9s)]
*  force this even at local levels. And on top of that, there are human rights groups who say that [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1619.02s)]
*  this could expose kids to discrimination. What is your response to that? I think kids have already [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1624.7800000000002s)]
*  been exposed to discrimination, especially young women and girls who have been forced to shower [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1629.98s)]
*  in locker rooms with biological men, who have been forced to compete on playing fields with biological [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1635.1000000000001s)]
*  men, which is incredibly unfair and unsafe. And again, an incredibly unpopular policy with the [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1641.1s)]
*  American people. As for the actions that this executive order takes, I already laid those out [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1648.06s)]
*  at the beginning of the briefing. I'm happy to give you a copy of this fact sheet so you can [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1652.4599999999998s)]
*  let your audiences across the country know. What's your message to schools who don't comply with it? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1656.3799999999999s)]
*  They should because it's going to be federal law in about an hour and a half. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1661.1s)]
*  So your colleague, to your right, to my left. Thanks, Carolyn. Taylor at Spectrum News. You talked [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1664.3799999999999s)]
*  a bit about Doge. Elon Musk is currently a, quote, special government employee who also owns [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1669.02s)]
*  companies that have billions of dollars in federal contracts. You said earlier this week [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1674.78s)]
*  that he has abided by all applicable federal laws, but what steps is the Trump administration taking [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1679.02s)]
*  to address that conflict of interest? The president was already asked and answered this question this [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1684.54s)]
*  week, and he said if Elon Musk comes across a conflict of interest with the contracts and the [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1688.86s)]
*  funding that Doge is overseeing, then Elon will excuse himself from those contracts. And he has [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1694.06s)]
*  again abided by all applicable laws. In the back left, go ahead. Trade advisor Peter Navarro, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1698.94s)]
*  when asked about the external revenue service today, said, quote, we're going to collect a lot [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1704.54s)]
*  of tariff revenues and we're going to get tax cuts out of it. Is it the official position of the [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1708.7s)]
*  White House that tariffs will lower taxes for Americans? The president has always been clear [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1713.3400000000001s)]
*  that he believes tariffs are a tax on foreign nations and he's committed to cutting taxes for [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1718.94s)]
*  the American people here at home. He also believes tariffs are a great revenue razor for this country [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1723.8200000000002s)]
*  and that's exactly why he has committed to the creation of the external revenue service, which I [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1728.86s)]
*  think is a phenomenal idea. Or just go down the whole road. Go ahead. Tom Boeven with the BBC, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1734.4599999999998s)]
*  can you confirm that under the president's plans for Gaza, any and all Palestinians who want to stay [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1739.02s)]
*  in Gaza on their land will be allowed to do so? I can confirm that the president is committed to [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1745.5s)]
*  rebuilding Gaza and to temporarily relocating those who are there because, as I've showed you [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1751.26s)]
*  repeatedly, it is a demolition site. There is no running water. There is no electricity. The president [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1757.02s)]
*  wants these individuals to live in peace. He is committed to doing that with this very bold new [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1762.46s)]
*  plan and we will continue to keep you apprised of updates as we receive them. Ed Lawrence. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1767.34s)]
*  That's not an answer. Yes, go ahead. I appreciate it. Thank you. So now that the president Trump's [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1772.3s)]
*  policies are starting to take shape, how long will it take to cycle through and get some of the actual [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1776.62s)]
*  prices that Americans are paying to come down? Prices at the store and at the grocery pump? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1781.98s)]
*  Across the board? Sure. Well, the president is doing everything he can, obviously, to reduce the [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1787.3400000000001s)]
*  cost of living crisis in this country as quickly as possible. That's why he signed a litany of [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1792.0600000000002s)]
*  executive orders across the board in the first couple of weeks here. He declared a national [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1797.74s)]
*  energy emergency. He committed to cutting 10 regulations for every new one on the book. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1802.46s)]
*  As you know, working for a Fox Business-related outlet, deregulation and energy independence [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1807.5s)]
*  are huge drivers of reducing inflation in this country. And I think Americans can be assured by [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1813.26s)]
*  the results President Trump had in his first term when, again, inflation was 1.4 percent when he [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1818.3s)]
*  left office. But is it months or is it a year? And will Americans have the patience to wait for it? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1822.94s)]
*  I don't have a timeline. All right. Listening in to White House press secretary Caroline Leavitt [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1827.26s)]
*  taking questions from reporters on a wide range of topics, and not the least of which, of course, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1831.82s)]
*  is what came out of President Donald Trump's mouth regarding Gaza and the future of Gaza. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1837.74s)]
*  Let's go live right now to CBS News contributor Robert Berger. He's live from Jerusalem. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1842.78s)]
*  So we're only weeks into the new presidency. We're also only days into phase one of the [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1847.02s)]
*  ceasefire deal, the hostage release deal. If this plays out the way the president seems to be [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1852.1399999999999s)]
*  signaling, could that deal be in jeopardy, Robert? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1857.74s)]
*  I think so. It's definitely this creates a problem for phase two of the ceasefire, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1862.3s)]
*  which is only beginning to be negotiated this weekend. Right now we're in phase one, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1868.6200000000001s)]
*  about halfway through 18 hostages have been released. And there's another hostage release [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1873.5s)]
*  set for Saturday. That's still on. But the second phase, which is the most difficult, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1880.06s)]
*  which is supposed to see an end to the war and the release of the remaining 50 or 60 hostages [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1884.94s)]
*  living and dead, that still has to be negotiated. The problem that this creates is that what does [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1891.8200000000002s)]
*  Hamas actually have to gain if the end game here is the end of Hamas rule in Gaza and the expulsion [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1899.02s)]
*  or displacement or transfer, if you will, of around two million Palestinians, maybe Hamas [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1908.9399999999998s)]
*  will want to hang on to the only card it really has to play, which is the hostages. And then, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1915.6599999999999s)]
*  yes, the ceasefire would be in jeopardy. What are you hearing from hostage families, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1921.1799999999998s)]
*  families of hostages that still are not being released even in phase one? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1925.5s)]
*  They're worried because, you know, like I said, this phase is going to see the release, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1929.58s)]
*  if all goes well, of 33 hostages, about 25 of whom are alive. Eight are dead. They still haven't [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1936.38s)]
*  gotten back yet. But you've got another 50 or 60, including younger people like soldiers, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1943.3400000000001s)]
*  who have been left for the second phase of the deal. The families of the hostages [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1951.5s)]
*  are very worried now that if this second phase doesn't go forward, then their loved ones [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1956.14s)]
*  may not get back. So you are closer to that situation than we are from where you are sitting [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1962.06s)]
*  right now in Israel. Jordan, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia are said to be working with Donald Trump and his [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1967.1s)]
*  administration on what to do with all of the people who would come out of Gaza. Do you get the sense [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1972.86s)]
*  that there is an active and positive movement with the president and those nations? Not really. We [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1978.7s)]
*  heard just now in the White House briefing that the president has been in touch with those countries [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1985.34s)]
*  and he keeps doubling down, saying they will take some refugees. Now, what we heard publicly [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1991.26s)]
*  today from Jordan, Egypt, and not only today, but in the past days, is the Palestinians have to remain [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=1997.02s)]
*  on their own land. This is a principle that's really guided Arab policy for decades. Palestinians [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2003.98s)]
*  have to remain on their own land in a future state. But maybe behind the scenes, certainly behind the [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2011.18s)]
*  scenes, the U.S. is trying to broker some kind of a bigger Mideast deal. It's going to be very [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2017.82s)]
*  difficult, though, to overcome that obstacle. And then we also heard from Caroline Levitt saying [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2023.58s)]
*  that the president has not committed to putting U.S. boots on the ground, has not committed to [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2029.5s)]
*  the United States and dollars of the United States going into rebuilding Gaza. Are people buying that [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2033.4199999999998s)]
*  where you are? Yeah, I don't think anybody's expecting to see American soldiers here in the [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2038.1399999999999s)]
*  Middle East anytime soon, certainly not in Gaza. I mean, that would be something, I think, even as [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2044.7s)]
*  she said, something further down the road that would be part of a bigger deal in coordination [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2053.42s)]
*  with the Arab states to rebuild Gaza. But still, this is a big obstacle, the concept of removing [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2059.98s)]
*  two million Palestinians out of Gaza. But maybe there could be some kind of compromise. I mean, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2070.06s)]
*  that's what was just suggested in the White House briefing. This could be an opening position [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2075.5s)]
*  as the U.S. tries to make a deal. Well, as Caroline Levitt said, and these are her words, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2084.46s)]
*  to preserve the leverage. We will see how that plays out. Robert, thank you so much for talking [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2088.94s)]
*  to us. All right. When we come back, news of executive orders coming from the White House [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2093.3399999999997s)]
*  once again and one with an unusual warning for Iran. You're watching CBS News 24 seven. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2098.06s)]
*  Welcome back to CBS News 24 seven. President Trump signed more executive orders Tuesday, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2115.1s)]
*  among them a maximum pressure campaign against the Iranian government in order to prevent them [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2118.86s)]
*  from getting a nuclear weapon. So the White House did not specifically state what kind of pressure [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2123.82s)]
*  that would include. Mr. Trump said he was torn when signing the order, then sent a chilling [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2128.54s)]
*  warning to Iran after reporters asked why he was unhappy to sign it if Iran previously threatened [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2134.1400000000003s)]
*  to assassinate him. Listen. Well, they haven't done that. And that would be a terrible thing for [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2139.5800000000004s)]
*  them to do, not because of me. If they did that, they would be obliterated. That would be the end. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2147.5s)]
*  I've left instructions. If they do it, they get obliterated. There won't be anything left. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2152.94s)]
*  And they should be able to do it. And Biden should have said that, but he never did. I don't know why [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2159.7400000000002s)]
*  lack of intelligence, perhaps. But he never said it. If that happens to a leader or close to a [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2164.14s)]
*  leader, frankly, if you had other people involved also, you would call for total obliteration of a [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2172.78s)]
*  state that that would include Iran. So let's go to CBS News Pentagon reporter Ellie Watson. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2179.82s)]
*  The word obliterated is a big word for a president to use. What does he mean? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2185.82s)]
*  Well, Reid, I'll get to what he said last night, but I do want to share something that we just [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2192.94s)]
*  learned and it's related. And that's that former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper has had his [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2197.42s)]
*  security detail, which was provided by the Defense Department, removed. We've heard that from a U.S. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2202.2200000000003s)]
*  official and a Defense Department official. Esper, like President Trump, has faced threats [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2207.74s)]
*  from Iran because of the 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, the former commander of the Iran's [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2212.54s)]
*  Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force. This removal of security from Esper follows other [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2218.7s)]
*  officials who have had their security revoked, like former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2225.9799999999996s)]
*  former National Security Adviser John Bolton. Now, as for what President Trump said last night [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2230.9399999999996s)]
*  about obliteration, he said very loudly and with language what the Biden administration [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2236.62s)]
*  actually said quietly last fall, which is that Iran has been warned that if it tries to attempt [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2241.98s)]
*  an attack on President Trump, it would be considered an act of war. Now, the Pentagon does [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2248.14s)]
*  have plans it could pull from that would significantly harm Iran, including going after [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2252.94s)]
*  its nuclear facilities. As far as instructions, only the commander in chief can instruct the [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2258.38s)]
*  military what to do. So any instructions left by a previous commander in chief, the military [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2266.2200000000003s)]
*  couldn't act on. All right. So let's go back to what you mentioned regarding Esper. What does [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2271.7400000000002s)]
*  this say about the president's relationship or suspicions there? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2276.3s)]
*  This is kind of the latest, what appears to be retaliation. I mean, when we got to the Pentagon [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2281.98s)]
*  on Inauguration Day, we saw the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, his [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2288.7000000000003s)]
*  portrait was removed from the Pentagon hallways. Several days later, we saw Secretary of Defense [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2292.7s)]
*  Mark Esper's portrait removed from when he was secretary of the Army. And we also saw Milley's [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2299.8199999999997s)]
*  portrait from the chief of staff of the Army hallway also removed. President Trump has not [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2305.18s)]
*  shied away from criticizing these officials who have criticized his first administration. And so [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2312.3799999999997s)]
*  this pulling of security detail seems to be the latest semi retaliatory move by the Trump [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2317.9s)]
*  administration. Now, President Trump, when asked about the previous officials who have had their [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2325.1800000000003s)]
*  security details removed, like Bolton, like Pompeo, Trump said that when you get security, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2329.9s)]
*  you don't get it forever. And that was part of his calculation when revoking them. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2335.26s)]
*  Okay. So what's the what's next? Who replaces who comes in line? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2342.38s)]
*  So the what we're wondering is who in the Defense Department actually gave the order. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2348.7000000000003s)]
*  This security for Mark Esper is provided by the Defense Department because he was a former [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2356.3s)]
*  Secretary of Defense. The security for Pompeo and for Pompeo's former aide, Brian Hook, that was [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2360.38s)]
*  provided by diplomatic security. And so Secretary of State Rubio actually gave that order. So we're [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2367.42s)]
*  fleshing through who actually gave the order to take these detail is away. And what the extent [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2374.86s)]
*  of the threat to these officials who were involved in cost and Soleimani's killing is today. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2381.02s)]
*  So many details to pick through. We'll leave that for you to chase answers. But while we have you [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2386.7000000000003s)]
*  here, I want to talk about President Trump's crackdown on undocumented immigrants. The U.S. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2391.02s)]
*  deported its first migrant group to Guantanamo Bay. Do we know who they are? And can you talk [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2394.46s)]
*  about the infrastructure the Pentagon needs to build to really accommodate the thousands [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2399.7400000000002s)]
*  of people expected? The first flight to Guantanamo Bay under this new plan proposed by President [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2403.18s)]
*  Trump arrived yesterday. That flight had about 10 detainees that the U.S. government considers [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2411.02s)]
*  high threat detainees. And so these members were told these were members were told of a Venezuelan [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2417.5s)]
*  gang. And because they're high threat, they're going to go into an already secure detention [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2423.98s)]
*  facility in cells. They'll be separate from the 15 prisoners that are still at Guantanamo Bay from [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2429.66s)]
*  the war on terror. But these new detainees will still be in cells. That's only 10 migrants. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2436.06s)]
*  President Trump has said that there should be space for up to 30,000. These already existing [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2441.5s)]
*  detention facilities don't have that space. And so over the weekend, the Pentagon sent 300 [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2446.46s)]
*  Marines who have begun building tents to have additional capacity as these expected migrants [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2453.02s)]
*  start making their way to Guantanamo Bay. CBS News Pentagon reporter Ellie Watson, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2460.86s)]
*  thank you so much. So many developments. Seems like by the minute we appreciate you jumping [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2465.02s)]
*  in to talk to us. So following that White House press briefing room, let's talk to CBS News senior [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2468.62s)]
*  White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe. Ed, you were in the room, major headline today, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2474.3s)]
*  the future of Gaza. Did we get any clarity on what Trump intends to carry out after saying that [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2479.1s)]
*  the U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip? What are the details here? We did not get many more details, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2483.5s)]
*  Reid. Good to be with you. But two things notable that Caroline did there, Caroline Levitt, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2490.54s)]
*  during the briefing. First of all, made clear, and this is somewhat massaging what he suggested [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2496.06s)]
*  last night, that there is no commitment yet to putting U.S. troops in the region. He seemed to [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2502.06s)]
*  infer that last night much more clearly, but today saying, no, he hasn't decided to do that [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2509.02s)]
*  for certain. There are a few questions on potential military engagement and she batted them away. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2515.2599999999998s)]
*  The other thing she said, remember he said that he supports the idea of permanently resettling [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2519.2599999999998s)]
*  everyone in Gaza to Egypt, to Jordan, or to other countries. Today she was saying, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2525.02s)]
*  or she was suggesting in part, that they might just temporarily relocate the two million plus who [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2530.54s)]
*  live in Gaza and allow them to come back later. All of this introduces a suite of follow-up [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2536.06s)]
*  questions about how exactly it would work. Their bottom line here at the White House is, look, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2541.98s)]
*  definition of insanity, as she put it, is to keep doing what's been done before. They're trying to [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2546.2999999999997s)]
*  come up with different options. Ultimately, what the President is doing here, when you consider [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2550.38s)]
*  that he's talking on a regular basis, it seems, with the Egyptians, he held meetings with the [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2554.38s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister last night, he has the King of Jordan coming soon, the Vice President's headed [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2558.62s)]
*  to Europe to talk to allies there next week, is to try to get some kind of international consensus [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2562.94s)]
*  and program put together to rebuild that part of the Middle East and sort through exactly what needs [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2568.06s)]
*  to be done next. But remember, the agreement that's in place that's been releasing hostages [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2573.5s)]
*  still doesn't have a firm commitment or plan to end the hostilities between the Israelis and Hamas. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2578.86s)]
*  Like, when would the Israeli defense forces pull out, for example, completely and stop that [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2584.46s)]
*  bombardment so that you could get to this step that the President has now seized on, and that [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2589.42s)]
*  is the potential redevelopment of the strip. Well, and I thought it was also telling, when [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2593.1800000000003s)]
*  Caroline Levitt was asked, well, can you rule out, why not rule out that military troops from the [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2597.98s)]
*  United States would not be boots on the ground, she said, quote, he wants to preserve leverage. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2603.1000000000004s)]
*  Is that what this is really all about? Sure. She says casting him as the dealmaker. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2608.3s)]
*  Reid, that's what everything this President is doing is all about, leverage. He says certain [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2614.3s)]
*  things to try to extract some kind of concession from the other side. They get something, they see [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2618.86s)]
*  it as a victory and they move on. They listed off a series of them today, for example, the meeting [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2624.78s)]
*  that the Secretary of State had in Panama, where he went warning that the U.S. might try to retake [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2629.1800000000003s)]

*  president do just hours after meeting with Rubio announced that the Panamanians are pulling out of [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2637.42s)]
*  a Chinese infrastructure plan? They see that as a win. What does he do? Threaten tariffs on Mexico [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2642.2200000000003s)]
*  and China and Canada, Mexico and Canada have phone calls with him on Monday by three o'clock. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2647.42s)]
*  It's all over. He claims that they're all going to send thousands of troops to their borders now [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2653.26s)]
*  to try to address the concerns about the flow of illegal drugs and undocumented immigrants. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2657.7400000000002s)]
*  He sees it as a win. What is he doing now here in the Gaza Strip? He's suggesting the U.S. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2663.02s)]
*  will potentially take it over. What is he hoping happens? He's hoping that Arab and other Middle [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2667.5s)]
*  Eastern countries step up now along with Europe and say, well, let's come up with a group plan [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2672.78s)]
*  here, some kind of international consensus on what exactly can be done to save this region and to [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2678.1400000000003s)]
*  rebuild it. Does it ultimately lead to having U.S. troops on the ground? Well, he doesn't want to [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2682.7000000000003s)]
*  rule that out yet because for some unfortunate reason, perhaps there needs to be. But by merely [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2686.7000000000003s)]
*  talking about it as dramatically and boldly as he did, it gets a conversation going now. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2691.02s)]
*  And he would hope potentially get allies to start making concessions or plans to help rebuild that [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2695.82s)]
*  region along with the United States. So yes, this is right out of the Trump playbook. It's what he [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2700.86s)]
*  does on a regular basis. Certainly has been demonstrating an ability to do it in foreign [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2706.38s)]
*  affairs. And this White House, at least a few weeks in now, suggests that they've scored some [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2710.7000000000003s)]
*  significant wins by doing so. We'll have to see as things play out whether or not they were indeed [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2715.58s)]
*  real concessions and lead to real change. But in the short term, they certainly see that as having [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2720.94s)]
*  happened. Ed O'Keefe reporting live. Fresh from that White House press briefing. Always good to [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2725.6600000000003s)]
*  talk to you. Thank you so much. When we come back on CBS News 24 seven, we are going to be asking a [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2730.3s)]
*  lot more questions. Of course, Elon Musk and his role looking at the line by line, the ledgers of [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2735.1800000000003s)]
*  the federal government and the question, are U.S. taxpayers getting the bang for their buck they [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2740.86s)]
*  deserve? We'll be right back. Well, we've been talking a lot about the heroic work of crews [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2745.6600000000003s)]
*  battling wildfires in Southern California, but they are also protecting their neighborhoods in [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2756.3s)]
*  other ways. Look at this dramatic rescue. This is out of San Bernardino County, Monday. Firefighters [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2760.94s)]
*  pulling a woman with special needs out of a home burning and then running to get her help. That fire, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2767.6600000000003s)]
*  in fact, was so hot at one point it charred and melted some of the firefighters' protective gear. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2773.5s)]
*  Just a picture of what goes on in every town USA when these firefighters and first responders risk [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2778.46s)]
*  their own lives. But they say they didn't think twice about putting their lives on the line. They [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2783.74s)]
*  knew somebody on the inside of that home needed help. They reached in and said, we will do it. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2789.1s)]
*  That's our job. They do it day in and day out. We see and celebrate all of our nation's first [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2795.74s)]
*  responders. The news continues on CBS News 24 seven. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xoip2C2dBk&t=2800.3799999999997s)]
