# Los Angeles braces for more strong winds amid wildfires
**CBS News:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw)
*  Welcome back. Right now, fire crews in Southern California, they're still trying to gain control of several deadly wildfires, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=0.0s)]
*  and their job may even get more challenging as new powerful winds could cause explosive growth. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=7.7s)]
*  Just last night, a new brush fire erupted in Ventura County, prompting evacuations there, of course. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=13.1s)]
*  And at this hour, the two largest fires you see on the screen next to me, the Palisades Fire and the Eaton Fires, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=19.1s)]
*  they remain mostly uncontained. Crews have the Hearst Fire almost completely contained. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=24.6s)]
*  Joining us now for more on everything happening in Southern California is CBS News correspondent Charlie Demar. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=30.6s)]
*  Charlie, first give us the update on what conditions feel like where you are right now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=36.0s)]
*  And Errol, good morning. The National Weather Service has issued a PDS, or a particularly dangerous situation alert, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  that just went into effect here at 4 a.m. local time. That will last until about noon tomorrow. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=48.800000000000004s)]
*  And the reason for that is, again, because of those high winds, dry conditions, and there's just no rain in sight. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=54.6s)]
*  This is the same alert that was in effect last week when those fires began. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  Again, we're not expecting the same speeds of those winds, but definitely a lot of concerns as those winds do pick up. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=65.1s)]
*  And for firefighters, if the fires do reignite, there is some concern that those airplanes, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=72.3s)]
*  those helicopters that have been so instrumental in getting a handle on the spread of this fire that they wouldn't be able to get in the air. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=78.6s)]
*  Remember last week as those winds prevented the helicopters and planes getting into the sky, which really let the blazes explode. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=87.8s)]
*  How prepared are officials now for these strong winds? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=95.7s)]
*  And again, that is the concern with the high winds, that those planes would be grounded. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=99.3s)]
*  But this time around, there are about 15,000 firefighters in place here. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=104.3s)]
*  That is a dramatically higher number than we were looking at just last week. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=108.8s)]
*  So because of that, firefighters believe that they are in good shape when these winds have been lower these last few days. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=113.39999999999999s)]
*  There's been a lot of preventative work laying down that red retardant to try and create a barrier to prevent the spread of the fire [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=119.9s)]
*  and also cutting down vegetation. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=127.0s)]
*  We've seen that over the last couple of days to not give any more fuel to these intense flames, Errol. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=129.1s)]
*  In our last few seconds, Charlie, just psychologically, how are people doing? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=134.8s)]
*  Every day I discover a new connection, a friend who has lost a home. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=138.5s)]
*  I'm just wondering from what you've seen, how people are holding up. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=142.3s)]
*  As you can imagine, this is devastating. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=147.9s)]
*  I mean, look what this has done to people's homes. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=149.8s)]
*  Many of them haven't even had the opportunity to see it for themselves. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=151.6s)]
*  They've just seen it on TV, on social media. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=154.9s)]
*  But we also have seen just a sense of community here. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  Neighbor helping neighbor. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=160.9s)]
*  That has been really beautiful to see the outpouring of support even from people who've lost their own homes. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=162.1s)]
*  They're stepping up in this desperate time of need. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=168.0s)]
*  All right, Charlie, thank you for that reporting. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=170.9s)]
*  Sources tell CBS News President-elect Trump is considering a visit to Fire Ravage Los Angeles after his inauguration January 20th. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=173.8s)]
*  One source says the trip could come as soon as next week. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=181.5s)]
*  President-elect has previously cast blame on state leaders over the response to the wildfires and called for California Governor Gavin Newsom to resign. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=184.7s)]
*  Meanwhile, a lawsuit has been filed against power company Southern California Edison over its alleged role in the Eaton fire. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=193.5s)]
*  Now, this suit filed by attorneys representing those affected by the Altadena fire alleged it began because of SoCal's failure to de-energize overhead [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=201.39999999999998s)]
*  Despite red flagged wind warnings from the National Weather Service. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=211.89999999999998s)]
*  In a statement, the utility company says it understood that a lawsuit related to the Eaton fire had been filed but has not yet been served with the complaint. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=215.6s)]
*  In an incident report to the State Public Utilities Commission, SoCal Edison disputed the claim. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=223.89999999999998s)]
*  Its equipment started the fire. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbcs5BrAdw&t=229.29999999999998s)]
