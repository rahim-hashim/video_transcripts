# New Trump executive orders expected on military culture
**CBS News:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo)
*  Right off the top, new week, new executive orders. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=0.0s)]
*  So we expect President Donald Trump to sign three new orders [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=3.14s)]
*  in relation to the military on day one of Pete Hecseff's job [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=6.84s)]
*  as our nation's newly confirmed Secretary of Defense. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=10.8s)]
*  So those orders include policies [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=13.0s)]
*  for transgender service members, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=14.84s)]
*  a ban on several DEI initiatives, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=16.98s)]
*  and reinstating members of the military [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=18.98s)]
*  who were discharged for refusing to get the COVID vaccine. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=20.98s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News White House digital reporter, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=24.88s)]
*  Aaron Navarro. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=27.72s)]
*  Aaron, nice to have you with us there [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=28.68s)]
*  from the White House lawn. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=29.82s)]
*  Are these orders timed on purpose with Hecseff's first day? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=31.18s)]
*  Reid, well, it certainly is Secretary Hecseff's [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=37.0s)]
*  first official day, of course, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=39.48s)]
*  was confirmed over the weekend. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=40.94s)]
*  And he actually kind of previewed [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=42.72s)]
*  some of these executive orders [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=44.08s)]
*  while talking to reporters outside the Pentagon this morning. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=45.32s)]
*  In addition to the ones you listed though, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=48.76s)]
*  I want to note he also talked about taking action [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=50.64s)]
*  on creating an American iron dome. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=52.64s)]
*  That's a reference to the missile system [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=55.26s)]
*  that's currently in place in Israel. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=57.44s)]
*  But the executive orders that you listed [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=58.919999999999995s)]
*  are also kind of in line with what Hecseff would do, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=61.44s)]
*  especially when it comes to DEI, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=63.8s)]
*  kind of remaking the culture of the US military. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=65.52s)]
*  So you talk about the iron dome, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  which makes us think of Israel. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=71.32s)]
*  Let's talk about Middle East envoy, Steve Wittkopf. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=73.24s)]
*  He is visiting Israel, but after a stop in Saudi Arabia, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=75.52s)]
*  what are those stops? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=79.68s)]
*  What's the objectives of the United States there? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=81.0s)]
*  Yeah, we know that Wittkopf was crucial [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=83.88000000000001s)]
*  in the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=86.92s)]
*  A goal that's expected for him during this visit [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  is to make sure that that ceasefire is on track, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  especially when it comes to getting to phase two, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  where you start to see more hostages released, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=97.72s)]
*  more male prisoners as well. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=100.42s)]
*  And we already saw some activity over the weekend [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=103.12s)]
*  when it came to kind of the order of hostages [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=105.64000000000001s)]
*  that Israel was going to release, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=108.68s)]
*  or sorry, that Hamas was going to release [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=110.72s)]
*  in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=112.84s)]
*  Wittkopf's presence, making sure [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  that that ceasefire agreement is still on track. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=116.64s)]
*  I also want to ask you about what happened, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=119.6s)]
*  sort of that back and forth [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=121.72s)]
*  between the United States and Colombia. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=122.84s)]
*  We know that over the weekend, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  Colombia did not allow a US flight [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=125.47999999999999s)]
*  carrying those deportees to land. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=127.24s)]
*  That prompted a threat from President Trump, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=129.6s)]
*  but now an about-faced report today? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  Colombian President Gustavo Petro [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=137.28s)]
*  really took issue with the fact [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=139.24s)]
*  that these migrants were coming in in shackles [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=140.6s)]
*  in US military planes. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=143.64s)]
*  But there was an agreement reached last night [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  where Colombia says that they have guaranteed [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=149.24s)]
*  the conditions of these migrants will be, quote, dignified. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=151.12s)]
*  They will still be coming on US military planes. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=154.72s)]
*  Colombia's president has offered his own presidential plane [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=156.76s)]
*  to help transport these migrants into the country. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=159.4s)]
*  But certainly, the risk of tariffs, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=162.44s)]
*  a tariff war between the two, seems to be put on hold. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=164.56s)]
*  And the US had also said there would be revocations of visas [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=167.95999999999998s)]
*  for Colombian officials. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=171.92s)]
*  That is still in place [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=173.04s)]
*  until the first plane of migrants arrives in Colombia, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=174.56s)]
*  but certainly in about-face, as you mentioned, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=177.56s)]
*  when it comes to the types of planes [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=180.2s)]
*  these migrants are coming on. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  All right, so, Aaron, while we have you, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=183.72s)]
*  we know that President Trump is down in South Florida today. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=185.04s)]
*  What's the ground game for the president [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=187.92s)]
*  on day one of a new week? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=189.6s)]
*  Yeah, the action is going to be in Congress, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=193.04s)]
*  especially in these next coming weeks and months, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  when it comes to the president's agenda. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=197.16s)]
*  He's expected to address the House Republican retreat [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=199.44s)]
*  as they kind of try and figure out [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=203.32s)]
*  whether it's the one-versus-two-bill approach [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=205.0s)]
*  and whether, you know, immigration, energy, tax policy, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=207.2s)]
*  all goes into one or is split up. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=210.64s)]
*  And House Republicans are looking for more clarity on that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=212.51999999999998s)]
*  In part, they're hoping to get that, potentially, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=215.64s)]
*  from Trump today in Florida. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=217.8s)]
*  Aaron Navarro, live from the White House, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=219.48s)]
*  thank you so much for those updates. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhXaFeVpyo&t=221.12s)]
