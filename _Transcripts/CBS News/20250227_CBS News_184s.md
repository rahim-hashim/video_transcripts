# USAID cuts are just the start of Trump, Musk plan to slash agency spending
**CBS News:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI)
*  Now, the cuts to USAID and other departments were a big part of the president's first cabinet [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=0.0s)]
*  meeting yesterday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=5.22s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News White House reporter Olivia Bernalde. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=6.22s)]
*  Olivia, it was sort of a surreal moment to have all of these members of President Trump's [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=9.18s)]
*  cabinet first time meeting all together in the same room. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=13.88s)]
*  And then to have Elon Musk sort of standing over all of them in black, wearing that black [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=18.06s)]
*  hat and talking about the things that he expects to do in his capacity with Doge, which we [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=24.02s)]
*  have also learned that he is not actually the administrator of. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=31.84s)]
*  Yeah, what a moment yesterday, that first cabinet meeting of Trump's second administration. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=34.58s)]
*  And at the start of it, Elon Musk really holding court with the press talking about the cuts [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=40.46s)]
*  of Doge and what they plan to do. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=45.0s)]
*  And really what we're learning is that USAID is just the start. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=46.620000000000005s)]
*  We saw a memo go out yesterday from the Office of Personnel Management to the heads of federal [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=50.02s)]
*  agencies essentially telling them to prepare for mass layoffs and reduction in force. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=54.3s)]
*  This memo went out and they asked these agencies to submit their plans by March 13th of how [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  they would reorganize these agencies, essentially reducing layers of redundancies, getting rid [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=67.5s)]
*  of federal contract workers, perhaps getting rid of any folks in the agency charts that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=75.2s)]
*  they consider duplicative. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  So a lot of movement there in the coming weeks, we should expect about a mass layoff of federal [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=85.28s)]
*  workers and really a restructuring of what the government, the federal government looks [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=89.94s)]
*  like and who works for the federal government. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  So let's talk about this meeting that will happen between the UK Prime Minister Keir [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=98.0s)]
*  Stammer and President Trump at the White House. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=103.0s)]
*  He's expected to make the case for the United States to maintain support for Ukraine. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=105.28s)]
*  Yesterday in that cabinet meeting, President Trump made clear that he's not guaranteeing [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=109.72s)]
*  Ukraine's security. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=114.44s)]
*  He said it should be left to the Europeans. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=115.44s)]
*  So what do we expect from Keir Stammer? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=117.72s)]
*  Right, so this meeting with the British Prime Minister is really sandwiched in between the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  meeting between the French President Macron, who was here on Monday, and the meeting tomorrow [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=124.22s)]
*  with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=128.06s)]
*  Now at that meeting tomorrow, Trump and Zelensky are expected to sign this critical Earth's [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=130.28s)]
*  mineral deal. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=136.2s)]
*  And essentially what this would do would give the U.S. access to a lot of the critical minerals [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=137.2s)]
*  that Ukraine is blessed with, lithium, iron, things that we use to make batteries. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=141.12s)]
*  So give the U.S. access. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=146.56s)]
*  But Trump is getting what he wants out of it, which is that he doesn't have to make [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=148.64s)]
*  any security guarantees. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=151.72s)]
*  So the British Prime Minister is here today to do a little bit of a delicate dance, talking [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=153.42000000000002s)]
*  with the president about Europe's security guarantees, that even though if there's a [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=158.1s)]
*  ceasefire, Macron and other European countries have discussed putting forth essentially reserves [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=162.57999999999998s)]
*  of troops to make sure that there's lasting peace in Ukraine, they want to make sure that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=169.01999999999998s)]
*  there are some U.S.-backed security guarantees for Europe as well in all of that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=174.62s)]
*  All right, Olivia Rinaldi at the White House for us this morning. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=179.85999999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Olivia. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZhB-kwnaI&t=182.7s)]
