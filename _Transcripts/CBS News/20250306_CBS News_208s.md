# Reaction from Israel to Trump's "last warning" for Hamas, direct U.S. talks with group
**CBS News:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo)
*  All right, turning now to the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=0.0s)]
*  President Donald Trump has issued what he has described as a last warning for Hamas [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=2.16s)]
*  to release all remaining hostages held in Gaza. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=6.48s)]
*  In a post to Truth Social, the president warned the militant group that if it did not comply [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=9.88s)]
*  with this demand, not a single Hamas member would be safe, and he will send Israel, quote, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=14.44s)]
*  everything it needs to finish the job. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=20.68s)]
*  For more on this, I'm joined now by John Donason with our partners at the BBC News. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=22.76s)]
*  John, good to see you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=26.76s)]
*  Stern words there from the president. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=28.44s)]
*  What reaction has there been to this? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=30.16s)]
*  Well, no reaction from Hamas, but I think the Israeli government is pretty pleased. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=34.52s)]
*  We've not had any official comment from the prime minister Netanyahu himself, but I just [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=38.24s)]
*  watched a briefing from his spokesperson, David Mensah, and he was pretty competitive. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  He said there wasn't an inch of ground between Israel and America's position. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=48.7s)]
*  He said Israel had never had a greater friend in the White House, and he really joined in [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=53.76s)]
*  those comments saying that if Hamas does not release all of the remaining hostages, then [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=60.4s)]
*  there is every chance that the war will resume and Israel will hit Hamas hard. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=66.52s)]
*  And John, we also know that this all comes as the White House confirmed the U.S. have [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=73.12s)]
*  had direct talks with Hamas. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=76.72s)]
*  That's pretty significant, right? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=79.08s)]
*  Yes, and I think it's another indication that President Trump is prepared to rip up the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=82.28s)]
*  rule book when it comes to U.S. diplomacy. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  America has not had direct talks with Hamas since 1988, when the organization was declared [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=92.52s)]
*  a terrorist organization. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=99.66s)]
*  So we're talking about more than three decades of U.S. diplomatic policy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=102.0s)]
*  There may have been talks behind the scenes through various back channels, but these were [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  direct talks between White House officials and Hamas officials, and that hasn't happened [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=111.36s)]
*  before. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=117.76s)]
*  The Israeli spokesperson I was mentioning, David Menta, he was asked about those talks. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=119.16s)]
*  He was pretty evasive in his answer, really no comment on the fact that America now seems [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=124.0s)]
*  to be talking to Hamas directly. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=128.56s)]
*  And John, what about the future of the Gaza ceasefire deal? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=131.0s)]
*  Do we have a sense of what happens next? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=133.36s)]
*  Well, I think it's on pretty rocky footing at the moment. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=135.96s)]
*  Essentially, we now should be into phase two of the ceasefire deal, which under the original [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=140.88s)]
*  agreement which was signed back in January, we should see the remaining hostages begin [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=146.72s)]
*  to be released and the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a permanent ceasefire and end to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  the war. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=159.88s)]
*  However, what the Israeli government is now saying is that that initial proposal, which [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=160.88s)]
*  was drawn up under President Biden, but of course, with strong influence from the then [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=165.96s)]
*  incoming President Trump, they're saying that is no longer acceptable. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  And they're saying there is now a new American proposal, which will see the first six week [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=174.4s)]
*  phase of the deal, the ceasefire be extended over Ramadan and Passover, which is over the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=180.0s)]
*  next month or so. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  And during that time, they want to see all the remaining hostages released dead and alive. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  And they want half of them to come out on the first day and half on the last. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=191.6s)]
*  Well, for that, for them, that is just not acceptable for Hamas without a guarantee that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=194.76000000000002s)]
*  the war will be over and that Israeli forces will withdraw. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=200.24s)]
*  OK, John, thank you for your time. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=204.72s)]
*  We appreciate this. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgO4iwoF-oo&t=206.24s)]
