# Hamas names 4 Israeli hostages they plan to release
**CBS News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc)
*  We're following some breaking news out of the Middle East where Hamas has just handed over the names of four Israeli hostages set to be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=0.0s)]
*  Released tomorrow joining us now for more on this is CBS News foreign correspondent Rami and essential who's joining me live from Tel Aviv to talk [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=5.48s)]
*  About this so so Rami. What are you learning? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=12.8s)]
*  Yeah, hey Vlad yeah breaking news just in the past couple minutes the spokesperson for Hamas is armed wing the Al Qasam [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=17.48s)]
*  Brigades released that list it is for Israeli female [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=24.6s)]
*  Soldiers we do have the names [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=30.08s)]
*  That Hamas has said but we are holding on that until we get confirmation from the Prime Minister's office or other [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=32.84s)]
*  Israeli family associations here for that confirmation, but what we do know is that as [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=40.44s)]
*  Hamas had said earlier this week that they would release female Israeli soldiers [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  We do know that these four on this list are 19 or 20 years old [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=53.2s)]
*  Abducted from the Nahaz Nahal Oz military base on October 7th, 2023 [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  That's just on the border with northern Gaza if this does go ahead in terms of the exchange tomorrow [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  They these four would then be exchanged for 200 Palestinian detainees currently held in Israeli prisons [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  Israel is also supposed to release a name a list of those names too [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=76.96s)]
*  But we haven't gotten any word from that just yet if the swap tomorrow does go ahead though [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=80.2s)]
*  Then 89 other hostages would still be in Gaza in Hamas's hands [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=84.82000000000001s)]
*  But the breaking news right now the four Israeli female soldiers their names the list has now come out from Hamas [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=89.02000000000001s)]
*  All right. That is some good news, Remy. Let me talk about [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=94.58000000000001s)]
*  What we're learning from Benjamin Net Yaz's office [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=98.5s)]
*  Which says that Israeli troops will remain in southern Lebanon beyond the Sunday deadline set in a ceasefire deal with Hezbollah [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  Talk to me about that [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=108.66000000000001s)]
*  Yeah on that time is almost up it was a 60-day ceasefire deal with Hezbollah signed back in November [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=111.66s)]
*  Israel at the time after a major a major [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=119.46s)]
*  Conflict between them was supposed to withdraw from southern Lebanon Hezbollah for its part was supposed to withdraw [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=123.74s)]
*  north of the Lethany River [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=129.62s)]
*  That's a river about 30 miles north of the Israeli border [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=131.7s)]
*  But now the office of Israel's prime minister says that that was conditional [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=135.7s)]
*  Based on Lebanon's own army [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=139.94s)]
*  Coming back into force moving back into southern Lebanon where really it had become impotent to try to enforce this agreement [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=143.34s)]
*  Israel is saying that since that hasn't happened. They aren't fully withdrawing just yet, too, but it is an open question [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=150.34s)]
*  I think the question many people are wondering [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=155.74s)]
*  Will this be a return to fighting no indication about that just as of yet? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=158.10000000000002s)]
*  So far also no response from Hezbollah or Lebanon's government to what the Prime Minister's office is saying about them staying in but they're [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=163.46s)]
*  Also saying that it will still be a phased [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=170.18s)]
*  Withdrawal the implication here that I'm taking from that is that there may not be a return to fighting [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=172.42s)]
*  But they're saying you better do this. You better do this soon [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=177.3s)]
*  Hmm. All right, I mean essential for us. Thank you, Rami. Appreciate it [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwELKM8zNc&t=180.1s)]
