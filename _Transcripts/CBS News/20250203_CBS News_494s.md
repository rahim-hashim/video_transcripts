# Trump delays tariffs on goods from Canada
**CBS News:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0)
*  Hello and thank you for joining us. President Trump is delaying tariffs against two of America's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=0.0s)]
*  closest trading partners, Mexico and Canada. The president says he's waiting 30 days to impose a [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=4.08s)]
*  25 percent tariff on goods imported from the two countries. The reversal comes after he spoke [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=9.28s)]
*  Monday with Mexico's president, Claudia Scheinbaum, and Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  The U.S. remains poised to issue a 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods starting Tuesday. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  That means U.S. businesses that import items from China will have to pay an additional import tax. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=25.28s)]
*  We're also tracking another big story from the White House. The president is set to overhaul [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=30.64s)]
*  USAID, the federal agency that oversees humanitarian aid programs. Three U.S. officials tell CBS News [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=34.8s)]
*  the Trump administration plans to merge the agency into the State Department and significantly cut [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  down its workforce. Over the weekend, billionaire Elon Musk said he spoke with President Trump about [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  the humanitarian agency and claimed they both agreed it should be shut down completely, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=52.56s)]
*  although doing so requires an act of Congress. On Monday, President Trump laid out some of his [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=57.2s)]
*  complaints with the agency. I love the concept of it. Yeah, sure. I love the concept, but they [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=62.0s)]
*  turned out to be radical left lunatics and the concept of it is good, but it's all about the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=68.72s)]
*  people. CBS News senior White House correspondent, Weijia Jiang, joins us now. Weijia, with some [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  a little bit more detail than that. Can you tell us why President Trump and Elon Musk feel that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=80.72s)]
*  USAID is essentially rotten to its core and needs to be overhauled completely? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=85.92s)]
*  Well, the White House actually passed around what they are calling a fact sheet, Lindsay, that lists [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=90.8s)]
*  all of the initiatives that they have the most issue with on this. They say that $1.5 million [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=95.68s)]
*  dollars was to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion in Serbia's workplaces. They point to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=100.72s)]
*  other tranches of money that were used for transgender efforts and different programs [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=108.4s)]
*  in other countries. So, you know, another one points to $2 million dollars for sex changes and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=115.36s)]
*  LGBT activism in Guatemala. So they are identifying the initiatives that they clearly do not agree [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=121.2s)]
*  with, which is no surprise given what President Trump has done to shut down all the DEI-related [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  programs in his own federal government, Lindsay. And so that is why they say it really needs to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=136.4s)]
*  have a close examination of the funding and how the agency is structured, which is why it is now [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=142.8s)]
*  going to be folded into the State Department. And we know that the acting administrator will be [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=149.68s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Elon Musk, heavily involved in this overhaul at USAID. He's been tasked [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=154.24s)]
*  with essentially cleaning up government. Do we have any idea what his role will be in [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=161.2s)]
*  other avenues that he may pursue? Today it's USAID. Do we have any idea what else could be on the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=167.92s)]
*  chopping block? Well, remember he is the head of DOJ, which is the Department of Government Efficiency. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=172.32s)]
*  And so he has come in and his main priority is to what he says cut government waste and spending. And [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=178.32s)]
*  just today, CBS News confirmed that it is looking at ways to dismantle the Department of Education, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=185.68s)]
*  which sounds dramatic, but we should note that we don't know exactly what that means yet and what [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  plans there are. But I would say, Lindsay, that nothing is protected when it comes to what Elon [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=198.32s)]
*  Musk will and will not go after because he does believe that there is so much government waste [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=206.96s)]
*  across the board. Let's turn to President Trump's decision to delay tariffs. What assurances did he [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=213.68s)]
*  get from Canada and Mexico that led him to delay these? Well, we know that this was down to the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=220.16s)]
*  wire, Lindsay. Those tariffs were supposed to be implemented at midnight. And after negotiations, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  Mexico has agreed to send 10,000 National Guard members to its border with the U.S. And in, you [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  know, just the past couple of hours, Prime Minister Trudeau announced that Canada would also send 10,000 [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=239.44s)]
*  personnel to the border, but also offered a lot more, including about a billion dollars package [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=246.4s)]
*  for a new technology, new choppers, new personnel to monitor the flow of fentanyl, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=253.76s)]
*  appoint a fentanyl czar. He also said that there would be a Canada-U.S. Joint Strike Force to [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=261.12s)]
*  combat organized crime. So all of these things really fall in line with what President Trump [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=267.52s)]
*  wanted. I mean, he really believes that these tariffs are a powerful tool, especially when it [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  comes to Mexico and Canada, and getting them to do more as it relates to sealing the border from [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=281.03999999999996s)]
*  illegal migrants and drugs. And we are seeing that play out tonight. The White House is really touting [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=287.44s)]
*  this as a victory, but we should note, Lindsay, that it's just a 30-day pause for now, and the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=294.32s)]
*  White House has not specified what could extend that pause and what they're looking for in terms of [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  markers or goals from Canada and Mexico. Weijia Jiang, thank you. Later this hour, we'll speak [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=305.28s)]
*  to the former head of global health at USAID about the Trump administration's plans to merge [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=312.32s)]
*  the agency into the State Department and how that could affect foreign aid programs worldwide. CBS [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  News Money Watch correspondent Kelly O'Grady joins us now. Kelly, we're talking about tariffs [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=322.08s)]
*  here. What is your read on what happened? We just heard we just say the president got what he wanted. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, it certainly wasn't elegant. There was a lot of back and forth, but I think it proved that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=330.08s)]
*  tariffs can be a very powerful negotiating tool, and that is one of the reasons that he said he [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=334.4s)]
*  would weld them. But here's the thing. It's also, will Americans be able to tolerate that as a [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=339.52s)]
*  negotiating tactic? Because the president himself said Americans could feel some pain with tariffs. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  Do we know how long that pain would last? It really depends on the industry. So let's take [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=350.48s)]
*  this 10 percent tariff on China that is expected to go into effect tonight. You won't see a full 10 [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=354.8s)]
*  percent increase when you go to the store, because that is something that's levied on a wholesale [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=360.56s)]
*  price, and then the company decides how much of that are they going to pass on to you and me. So [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=365.68s)]
*  you're not going to see $10 more on $100. But it depends on the industry of how long that would [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=371.92s)]
*  take effect because of inventory, different sourcing. Maybe a company might be able to get [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=376.56s)]
*  something from Taiwan instead of China. So it really depends on the industry, but yes, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=382.0s)]
*  for some types of products, that would be pretty painful. Interesting, though, that you said Taiwan, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=386.24s)]
*  for an example, when one of the purposes of this is to bring back U.S. manufacturing, right? Fair. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=390.8s)]
*  Yes, that is. So knowing the prices go all the way up, how does he justify that this will be [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=395.36s)]
*  worth it in the long run? Right. So this is what's the good argument for tariffs. Right, the 101. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=399.92s)]
*  And one would be bringing manufacturing here because a company that is having to import, pay a 10 percent [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=405.36s)]
*  tax, would say, well, maybe I could actually build that battery or build that product here in the U.S. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=411.6s)]
*  Another would be lessening the trade deficit with our trading partners. Right now, we buy [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=418.24s)]
*  more products than we sell to Canada, Mexico, and China. So if we could build more beneficial trade [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=423.36s)]
*  relationships, that could go down. The other thing is- But there's a trade war. That's not [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=430.48s)]
*  necessarily happening. That's fair, though Mexico and Canada do seem to want to come to the table [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=433.6s)]
*  and talk about those things. Negotiating tactic again. All right, how are the markets and how are [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=439.12s)]
*  businesses reacting to this back and forth? The markets were all over the place, Lindsay. We saw [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=442.72s)]
*  a huge drop, then the Mexican president came to the table, and all of a sudden we actually came [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=447.68s)]
*  back less in the red. Businesses, it's very tough. This back and forth, this question of 30 days, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  is it going to go into effect? We spoke to a farmer. We're putting together a piece about how [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=458.88s)]
*  they're dealing with this. They're thinking, okay, I have to buy fertilizer. I have to buy all of this [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=463.76s)]
*  stuff. It's going to squeeze me. Yeah, I'm not buying for 30 days from now. I'm buying for- [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=467.92s)]
*  Exactly. X, fill in the blank. And then the other piece is the retaliatory aspect. I'm also planning [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=471.28s)]
*  how much I'm going to plant to sell to China. What if they decide not to buy? There's so many [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=476.96s)]
*  different things businesses are navigating. We will be looking forward to that story. Kelly O'Grady, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=481.36s)]
*  thank you. And later this hour, we are going to hear from an American business owner who says [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=485.2s)]
*  he will be directly impacted by these tariffs and how it will affect his production. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XStSSxdDoq0&t=488.8s)]
