An additional 10% tariff has also been added to the existing measures against China, bringing the tariffs against Beijing up to 20%.

# Impact of Trump tariffs against Mexico, Canada and China
**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw)
*  All right, as we've been reporting all morning, the U.S. has now imposed a 25 percent tariff [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=0.0s)]
*  on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=7.16s)]
*  An additional 10 percent tariff was also slapped on imports from China on top of existing measures, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=10.96s)]
*  bringing those up to 20 percent. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=16.72s)]
*  President Trump announced the move in a speech at the White House yesterday as he prepares [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=19.6s)]
*  to address Congress tonight. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=23.7s)]
*  Joining us now for more on this from London is CBS News foreign correspondent Remy Anosentia, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=25.76s)]
*  Remy, from your point of view, what has the global reaction been to these series of tariffs? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  Sure. Good to see you, Errol. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=36.72s)]
*  Yeah, European markets here that I'm following, it's a sell-off. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  U.S. markets following their down day yesterday. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=42.72s)]
*  Right now, here in the U.K., the FTSE 100 is down by about four-tenths of a percent, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=47.52s)]
*  but it gets worse from there looking across to the continent. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=52.52s)]
*  For example, the Cacaronde in France is down by more than one percent, and in Germany, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=56.04s)]
*  it's down by nearly two percent. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=60.96s)]
*  These countries, pretty much the world really, all afraid of what might happen to them. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=64.44s)]
*  We're looking ahead to March 12 as well, Errol, because that is when those Trump tariffs on [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  steel and aluminum are set to go in effect. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  And this is part of Trump's America First agenda, right? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=76.16s)]
*  But America First will mean that America hurts as he tries to increase what he says [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=79.4s)]
*  is U.S. domestic production by making those imports from around the world more expensive. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=85.76s)]
*  Taking a look at the U.S. market close, if you've got money in U.S. stocks, you are [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=90.96s)]
*  no doubt feeling the pain. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=95.52s)]
*  Markets fell hard right after Trump announced those tariffs. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=97.0s)]
*  The Dow down by one and a half percent there. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=99.4s)]
*  The S&P 500 down by 1.8, let's call it, and the Nasdaq down by more than two and a half [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  percent. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=108.84s)]
*  For the Dow, this is actually its worst day so far this year for 2025. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=109.84s)]
*  And you know, Trump's targets, China and Canada for now, have already struck back. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  For example, China is now striking back with up to 15 percent tariffs on $22 billion of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=121.32s)]
*  U.S. imports. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  That starts on March 10th, so six days from now. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=130.35999999999999s)]
*  There's also a 10 percent tariff on a lot of ag, a lot of U.S. ag, soybeans, beef and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=133.79999999999998s)]
*  fruits. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=140.48s)]
*  But analysts who are seeing this, even though 22 billion is a big number, this is being [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=141.48s)]
*  seen as more of a measured response because the U.S. has actually tariffed more than $500 [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  billion of Chinese exports with the United States. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  As for Canada, they're looking at tariffs of more than $100 billion on U.S. imports. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=156.08s)]
*  The first stage already went into effect at midnight. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=161.36s)]
*  Then three weeks from now, we're expecting 25 percent tariffs on another $20 billion [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=164.96s)]
*  worth of goods there. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=169.68s)]
*  But in focus, for example, things like Florida orange juice, Kentucky bourbon, Ontario's [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=171.92s)]
*  mayor Doug Ford also said that they could cut electricity. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  Yes, Canada does send electricity to the United States, powering about six million homes. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=181.16s)]
*  And then as for Mexico, we're still waiting for some kind of announcement from Claudia [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  Scheinbaum, the president there. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=190.48s)]
*  But she says, she said yesterday that they have a plan B, a plan C and a plan D, so they're [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=192.28s)]
*  ready. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=198.2s)]
*  So I'm guessing, Remy, in the short term, how soon will people watching start to see [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=199.28s)]
*  what they purchase jump and increase? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=203.44s)]
*  And how long could that last? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=205.83999999999997s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=207.56s)]
*  Well, it depends on what goods are in focus here, but it will take some time. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=208.56s)]
*  It could take on the order of a few months to really have this percolate through from, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=215.32s)]
*  let's say, the exporters in Canada or Mexico to the middlemen and then onwards to the consumer. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=220.32s)]
*  So it's a question on whether those companies might want to eat some of the cost or whether [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=228.44s)]
*  they want to, of course, pass that on to the consumer. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=233.76s)]
*  But passing it on to the consumer, that gives rise to the question about inflation, because [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=237.48s)]
*  as we know, President Trump was elected in part to better the economy, to try to fight [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=244.72s)]
*  against inflation. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=251.48s)]
*  And looking at a most recent CBS News poll, on the left side of your screen, you can see [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=253.48s)]
*  that the economy, inflation, taxes and government spending, those are the most important high [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=257.8s)]
*  priority items that people pulled by CBS News find most important. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=261.88s)]
*  But if you flip up the screen one more time, the second chart that we have finds that those [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=266.68s)]
*  same issues are actually things that CBS News pulled find the least of a priority. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  For example, inflation coming in at 29 percent, the economy at 36 percent. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=280.8s)]
*  So all of this begs the question of if and when Donald Trump will address this. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  And of course, if he carries on with these trade tariffs, this tit for tat that has now [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=291.8s)]
*  kicked off, that will percolate down to higher inflation. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=299.32s)]
*  And as we know, he wasn't elected to raise inflation, but to take it down. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=304.32s)]
*  Yeah, very good point. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=308.76s)]
*  Rami Inosentio, live for us from London. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=309.76s)]
*  Thank you, Rami. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxbjzlMULw&t=311.68s)]
