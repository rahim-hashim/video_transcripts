# Newark mayor speaks out against ICE raid in New Jersey city
**CBS News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o)
*  Immigration and customs enforcement say ICE agents targeted a work site in New [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=0.0s)]
* ark, New Jersey. Surveillance video shows what appears to be ICE agents [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=6.08s)]
*  taking a man into custody outside Ocean Seafood Depot. The owner says agents [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=10.84s)]
*  arrived at the work site at around 11 o'clock yesterday morning asking to see [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=15.98s)]
*  his employees documentation. Newark's mayor is now criticizing the operation, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=20.36s)]
*  saying that it violated the Fourth Amendment. He just spoke this morning. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Let's take a listen from just moments ago. In our city without a warrant, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  they went in the back of the establishment. We believe that there [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=35.44s)]
*  were three people who they say were undocumented that they detained, but [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=39.8s)]
*  they also detained folks that were in fact citizens of this country. One [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=43.92s)]
*  person showed their military veteran identification and was still questioned [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=50.0s)]
*  anyway. People were fingerprinted. Uh, pictures of their IDs and face were [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=55.080000000000005s)]
*  taken there. Uh, when I got this information, I was appalled, upset, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=62.32s)]
*  angry that this would happen here in this state in this country that this [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=69.74000000000001s)]
*  would be allowed. Uh, since that since we said something about it, I [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  convened my folks. I said, we can't just let this happen and not say anything [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=79.92s)]
*  that we at least have to say something. And so we did. And here we are. And as [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=84.8s)]
*  a result of that, I've got a series of phone calls and emails that were not [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=89.36s)]
*  too nice. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=94.52s)]
*  One of them says, Oh, you're not going to stand idly by. These are dangerous [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=97.12s)]
*  rapists and murderers that the liberals in this country have protected far too [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=101.22s)]
*  long. You want to defy the federal government, F around and find out what [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=105.96s)]
*  will happen. You little whatever. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=110.96s)]
*  The problem with this is that none of these people were rapists or murderers [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  or criminals. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=120.8s)]
*  The problem with it is that ice went in there without a warrant and we can [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=123.3s)]
*  disagree on politics. You can disagree with me about, uh, the role immigrants [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=129.0s)]
*  play in the economy in our community. You can disagree with me about the fact [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=135.24s)]
*  that most immigrants are not criminals. In fact, they are victims of violence [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=140.04000000000002s)]
*  in cities. We can disagree about whether you support mass deportation or not. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=144.88s)]
*  But what we must agree on is that the thing that separates this country from [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=150.88s)]
*  many other countries around the world is the Constitution of the United States. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=155.16000000000003s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=161.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=161.96s)]
*  That is the mayor of Newark, New Jersey, criticizing a raid by ice yesterday at [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=164.96s)]
*  a seafood depot in his city. He's calling the raid illegal, was done [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=170.28s)]
*  without a search warrant and that it violates the Fourth Amendment. Meanwhile, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=174.72s)]
*  last night, the White House press secretary announced the arrest of, quote, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=179.2s)]
*  538 illegal immigrant criminals. She says they include a suspected terrorist, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=182.88s)]
*  four gang members and several convicted of sex crimes against minors. CBS News [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=189.16s)]
*  correspondent Adam Yamaguchi is live in San Diego for us with the latest on the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  immigration and deportation crackdown. Adam, going back to that ice operation [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=198.12s)]
*  in Newark, why was that so controversial? It was done without a search warrant. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  And by the way, Newark is also a sanctuary city, right? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=207.0s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. You're right. Newark is a sanctuary city. As the mayor of Newark [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  said in that presser just a few moments ago, the controversy that's been generated [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=216.6s)]
*  by this is one, the fact that ICE agents could not or did not produce a warrant [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=222.48s)]
*  and that this was a violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=227.84s)]
*  which guarantees people protection from unreasonable searches and seizures. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  And as also noted, the operation also involved the temporary detention of U.S. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=236.32s)]
*  citizens as well as undocumented immigrants. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=243.72s)]
*  So, Adam, the Trump administration also gave federal immigration officers the power [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=248.88s)]
*  to revoke the legal status of thousands of migrants and then seek their deportation. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=254.12s)]
*  So how would that work exactly? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=258.96s)]
*  Yes, so what this is in reference to is the 1.5 million migrants who are allowed [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=263.0s)]
*  into the country under a Biden administration program. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=268.72s)]
*  Essentially, the president has the authority to allow people in as part of what's called [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=271.68s)]
*  immigration parole. So, again, 1.5 million people who had been allowed to enter the U.S. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=278.04s)]
*  via the CBP-1 app, as well as a number of other countries that had agreements or that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=284.0s)]
*  the administration had allowed into the country. We're talking about migrants from Venezuela, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=289.56s)]
*  Haiti, amongst others. The Trump administration says that the Biden administration used that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=294.48s)]
*  parole authority improperly and is thus rescinding those people who were effectively allowed [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=301.24s)]
*  into the country under that program. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=308.0s)]
*  And Adam, a federal judge blocked President Trump's executive order ending birthright [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=310.12s)]
*  citizenship. This is, you know, written in the Constitution. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=314.68s)]
*  What could we see in this ongoing legal battle here? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=319.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's likely to be a protracted battle that could ultimately end up in the Supreme [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  Court. This was seen as by the judge as a blatant unconstitutional violation, that's [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=327.92s)]
*  something that he has not seen after 40 years on the bench. So, again, we're likely to see [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=334.32s)]
*  a number of challenges. There are a number of other challenges, including the one out [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=340.24s)]
*  of Seattle. And there's another hearing scheduled for February 6. And but for now, the president [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  now there is a two week restraining order, again, which could could potentially get extended. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=351.2s)]
*  Adam Yamaguchi, thank you so much. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D58dqdiG2o&t=359.03999999999996s)]
