# What Trump says Canada, Mexico can do to stop tariff threat
**CBS News:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU)
*  Hello and thank you for joining us. Just two days after imposing 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump is hitting the pause button. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=6.44s)]
*  The president signed a series of executive orders Thursday, granting exemptions for products that are compliant under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=8.76s)]
*  That's the trade deal President Trump negotiated during his first term as a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement, known as NAFTA. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=16.7s)]
*  A White House official says about half of the products coming from Mexico and about 38% of products from Canada fall under the U.S.-MCA. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=24.22s)]
*  The exemptions last until April 2nd, at which point the president's broad reciprocal tariffs will take effect. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=31.86s)]
*  Canada says retaliatory tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods will stay in effect, U.S. goods that is, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=38.2s)]
*  but it will no longer impose a second round of tariffs on U.S. imports on $125 billion worth of goods. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=44.9s)]
*  President Trump spoke about his overall tariff strategy at the White House Thursday, including concerns for many Americans that it could ultimately raise prices. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=52.56s)]
*  This is something that we have to do. There will always be a little short-term interruption. I don't think it's going to be big, but [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  the countries and companies that have been ripping us aren't particularly happy with what I'm doing, but the United States will be very happy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=67.5s)]
*  CBS News White House reporter Olivia Rinaldi joins us now. So, Olivia, what led to this month-long tariff exemption? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=78.84s)]
*  And we don't do we know if anything can be done to stave off this April 2nd deadline? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=85.74000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Lindsay, it's good to be with you. We know that that desperate phone call from the big three, this is Stellantis, Ford and General Motors, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=90.94s)]
*  the big three automakers, is really what started this conversation about delaying these tariffs. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  We know that they called Trump Tuesday ahead of his joint address to Congress. He spoke with them again yesterday, and he urged them, or they urged him, rather, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=105.04s)]
*  to really push off these tariffs, at least for a month. Let them figure this out. Let them figure out how they can deal with this, because this 25 percent tariff would be [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=113.94000000000001s)]
*  compounding on them. Essentially, a lot of car manufacturing in North America happens in Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=121.64000000000001s)]
*  The part might be made in Canada, brought over the border, you know, assembled here, then sent back over the Canadian border, perhaps the Mexican border. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=131.24s)]
*  Think of them paying a 25 percent tariff on that every single time it would compound. It would certainly raise the price of cars. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=138.84s)]
*  So this was all spurred as a result of the action from the automakers. But to your question on what can be done to getting these tariffs off, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  Trump says the only thing that will make him reconsider is action on stopping fentanyl from coming across the border. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  He says he wants to see more from Canada, more from Mexico, and really preventing the flow of fentanyl across the northern and southern border. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=161.14s)]
*  He says that's the only thing that will make him change his mind. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=169.33999999999997s)]
*  President Trump is preparing to sign an executive order calling for the dismantling of the Department of Education. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=172.94s)]
*  We know he can't do that without Congress. So what do we know about the potential timing of this and the impacts? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=178.64s)]
*  Well, we do know that there is a draft of the order. CBS News was able to confirm that there is a draft order out. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=183.83999999999997s)]
*  And, Lindsay, this is something Trump has been talking about since the campaign trail about dismantling the Department of Education. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=189.74s)]
*  It's also something Republicans have been talking about since its inception back in 1980. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=196.54000000000002s)]
*  This has been a target of theirs for a long time. So there is a draft of this order. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=201.24s)]
*  There is speculation Trump might be signing it today. Caroline Lovett, the White House press secretary, said that's not going to happen today. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=205.54000000000002s)]
*  But this is pretty typical. An EO gets floated. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=212.84s)]
*  There's reaction. And then the administration goes back and perhaps changes or alters what's in the executive order ultimately to sign it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=215.84s)]
*  Anyways, it was a playbook we've seen time and time again. Not new to see it today. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=223.34s)]
*  But as I mentioned, this department was created by an act of Congress back in 1980. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=227.24s)]
*  It's going to take an act of Congress to get rid of it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=233.44s)]
*  And I imagine they will be hard pressed to find any Democrats who are going to sign on to this with them dismantling this agency. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=236.94s)]
*  And downsizing federal agencies, a big part of what Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency or DOJ are trying to do. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=244.94s)]
*  Musk met with cabinet secretaries Thursday. What do we know? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=251.04s)]
*  And we know that Trump convened members of the cabinet today. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=254.64s)]
*  It wasn't an all hands on deck meeting, but we do know there were a lot of members of his cabinet there today. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=257.54s)]
*  And essentially, the conversation was more of a directive for these agencies to be working closely with Elon Musk and DOJ. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=262.44s)]
*  Our Sarah Cook spoke with a White House official who said that POTUS wanted to make it clear. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=270.14000000000004s)]
*  We want to fire the bad apples, keep the good ones and hire qualified people as well. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  And Trump was essentially directing them to coordinate and work better with Elon Musk and DOJ. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=279.04s)]
*  After that meeting, Trump wrote on True Social that he wants his agencies to take a scalpel rather than a hatchet to some of these federal firings that we have seen. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=285.24s)]
*  But of course, we saw Elon Musk at CPAC with a chainsaw, as he has certainly been taking major cuts to a lot of federal organizations. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=295.34s)]
*  So Trump saying this will be done essentially by the department heads. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=303.64s)]
*  It is their ultimate decision of who to cut. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  But if they don't cut, he said, Lindsey, that Elon Musk will do the cutting. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=310.94s)]
*  I think a lot of people who are cut, though, would argue they were not bad apples. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=314.84s)]
*  Olivia Rinaldi, thank you. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=317.73999999999995s)]
*  Markets plunged after President Trump announced he would delay tariffs on some Mexican and Canadian imports. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=320.24s)]
*  The Dow fell triple digits after the president made the announcement Thursday afternoon on True Social, which at the time only mentioned Mexico. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=325.74s)]
*  Investors appear uncertain over the direction of President Trump's tariff policies. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News Money Watch correspondent Kelly O'Grady. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=337.24s)]
*  So Kelly, for people who are worried about prices, what are the takeaways from the president's announcement? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=340.24s)]
*  A lot of uncertainty, to be perfectly honest. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=346.44s)]
*  I mean, I'm never someone that says go out and panic buy. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=348.74s)]
*  OK, I'm very against that. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=351.64s)]
*  But I do think that if there are purchases that you are thinking about making, like a car that is from one of those three automakers, this is a time to say, OK, maybe is maybe this is the time to pull the trigger. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=353.24s)]
*  I do think also there is just this big question, which you saw reflected in the markets today of when are we going to get this keep? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=365.14s)]
*  Is it going to get pushed out further? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=373.14s)]
*  Is it going to go on other countries? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=375.34s)]
*  When? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=377.14s)]
*  How much? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=377.64s)]
*  There's just so much uncertainty that I do feel like there's a lot of whiplash, whether you're an investor or you're a consumer right now. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=378.54s)]
*  And it's not a complete pause on all tariffs, right? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=384.34000000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's only the products that are covered under the USMCA. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=387.54s)]
*  And President Trump said part of the reason he's doing that is out of accommodation, out of respect for Mexico's president. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=391.24s)]
*  But does he have a legal obligation to follow through with what was signed in the USMCA? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=397.24s)]
*  He does. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=401.94s)]
*  And if you remember, USMCA is a replacement for NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=402.64s)]
*  And Olivia was mentioning that this is all about fentanyl. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=408.74s)]
*  And that is the message from the White House. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=412.34s)]
*  But I can tell you, the folks that I'm talking to, the second I saw him bring up Mexico and Canada, we were all saying this is about ultimately renegotiating the USMCA in the future. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=414.24s)]
*  Now, that comes up for review in twenty twenty six. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=424.94s)]
*  And a lot of the economists are saying we're going to see kind of this whiplash with Mexico and Canada until that time when he would want to review it and renegotiate. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=427.94s)]
*  Or is this part of the negotiation to get those parties to the table before twenty twenty six? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=437.14s)]
*  Potentially. So part of the tariff strategy is also to bring more manufacturing jobs to the US. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=440.73999999999995s)]
*  In an interview Thursday, Commerce Secretary Lutnick said investing in robotics will help with that. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=446.53999999999996s)]
*  Let's watch. If you look at Foxconn, who makes iPhones, right? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=451.44s)]
*  They have two and a half million people who work for them in China. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=455.24s)]
*  How can we compete with that labor? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=460.04s)]
*  The answer is robotics are going to do it better and cheaper. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=462.74s)]
*  And the key to robotics is going to be American AI and American intuition and the American technology. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=467.04s)]
*  Is the technology there to pull that off? And what would that mean for American manufacturing jobs? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=474.74s)]
*  It's not. In fact, my job was open when I was watching this on CNBC earlier. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=478.54s)]
*  Secretary Lutnick is right. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=483.14s)]
*  Ultimately, we will get to the point where automation and AI is able to make this iPhone. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=484.44s)]
*  But he was saying, well, look, Apple has decided to come and do a lot of their manufacturing here. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=490.74s)]
*  We are just not at that point. And something interesting, it would get rid of a lot of those manufacturing jobs. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=495.94s)]
*  Now, sure, it's going to create jobs for people with that special skill set in order to develop all of that technology. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=502.84s)]
*  But you're going to get rid of a lot of jobs of sort of the manual labor. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=509.24s)]
*  And so that when I heard those comments, it was a big question mark for me because President Trump is really focused on rebuilding our manufacturing sector. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=513.34s)]
*  A report out today found that U.S. employers laid off 172,000 people last month. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=521.24s)]
*  That's actually the highest since July 2020 during the pandemic. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=526.24s)]
*  What's behind this? So Doge, those layoffs accounted for a third of the percentage. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=529.34s)]
*  And by the way, Spike versus January of 245 percent. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=534.44s)]
*  So this was a really big number we weren't expecting. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=538.74s)]
*  Also, the retail sector as well as the technology sector, there's a lot of concerns about economic conditions. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=541.34s)]
*  We had some bankruptcies. So that's what's driving that number. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=546.34s)]
*  OK, Kelly O'Grady, thank you. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odND08ghpHU&t=548.94s)]
