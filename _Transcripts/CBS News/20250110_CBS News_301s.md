# Former Trump White House lawyer reacts to "hush money" sentencing
**CBS News:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk)
*  President-elect Donald Trump says he is going to appeal his conviction in the New York criminal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=0.0s)]
*  hush money case after being sentenced without any penalties. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=6.76s)]
*  Ty Cobb joins us now to discuss. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=11.28s)]
*  He was formerly a member of the Trump administration's legal team. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=13.58s)]
*  He is also a former federal prosecutor. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=17.28s)]
*  Mr. Cobb, thanks so much for being with us. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=19.84s)]
*  This sentencing, as you know, included no jail time, probation or fines for the president-elect, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=22.96s)]
*  He can't own a gun and he must provide a DNA sample for New York's crime data bank. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=28.36s)]
*  What is your reaction to this sentencing and do you believe justice was served? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=34.24s)]
*  That's a very difficult question, particularly with regard to this case. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=41.0s)]
*  This case, unlike the two federal cases, which were serious cases and well founded in the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=44.08s)]
*  law, this case was always subject to significant criticism for the way it was constructed and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  pursued and with good reason. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=59.96s)]
*  I think this case may not survive on appeal. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  But what was at issue today was not the legality of the indictment or the validity of the charges, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=64.96s)]
*  but was the opportunity to honor and perfect the verdict of 12 jurors who were unanimous [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=72.8s)]
*  that Trump had committed 34 felonies and in their judgment was guilty and needed to be [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=80.2s)]
*  sentenced. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=89.2s)]
*  The sentencing perfects his conviction. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  It permanently puts him in the ranks of convicted felons and it also triggers his appellate [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=96.12s)]
*  rights, which I think a year or more down the road will likely result in overturning [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  of this conviction. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=107.92s)]
*  But even if it does not, it doesn't undermine what the jury did. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=109.0s)]
*  The jury did their duty and found him guilty and today he stands guilty as charged. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=114.0s)]
*  You and other members of the nonprofit group State Democracy Defenders Action filed an [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=121.14s)]
*  amicus brief to the Supreme Court asking the justices not to stop this sentencing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=126.88s)]
*  Why was it important for it to go forward? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=131.72s)]
*  Well, it was important to go forward because as we've seen, Trump rail against the legal [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=134.72s)]
*  system, the rule of law, every legal institution from state courts to federal courts to the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=141.72s)]
*  Supreme Court. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=148.72s)]
*  It was important to reinforce the significance and the dominance of the rule of law in America [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  and to try to restore the concept which has been dinged up a little bit that no one is [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=157.76s)]
*  above the law. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=165.56s)]
*  There was no legal basis in my view and in the view of the majority of the Supreme Court [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=167.04s)]
*  justices for pausing the sentencing. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  I think Trump's complaints were largely political and personal but did not really have a legal [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=176.76s)]
*  basis. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=183.8s)]
*  I think it was very important that the court act according to the law and permit the sentencing [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  to go ahead as it did. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=192.16s)]
*  At this point, the president-elect is facing no penalty as we said from this trial. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=194.04s)]
*  His other two federal cases involving January 6th as well as the classified documents has [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=199.24s)]
*  been dropped and of course the prosecutor in the election interference case in Georgia [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=204.6s)]
*  has been disqualified. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=209.24s)]
*  At this point, could he face any further legal repercussions or is this all behind him now? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=210.84s)]
*  It's largely behind him. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=219.36s)]
*  The only potential legal repercussions would be in the Georgia case. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=220.6s)]
*  The two federal cases are dead and over and I'm sure that he will quickly pardon his two [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=224.44s)]
*  co-defendants in the Florida case and that case will be totally dead and over. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=233.0s)]
*  With regard to the Georgia case, he doesn't really have any control over that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=239.2s)]
*  On the other hand, as you point out, Fonny Willis has been disqualified for her ethical [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=242.83999999999997s)]
*  lapses and misconduct and they have to restart that if they so choose. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=248.56s)]
*  They say they will but we shall see. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=256.08s)]
*  I think that case also suffers in terms of its construction and I doubt that the case [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=259.03999999999996s)]
*  has charged, ever gets to trial but certainly as to the president, it's not going to go [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=266.36s)]
*  to trial for at least the next four years in my view although there's no dominant rule [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  or case law that dictates that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=280.24s)]
*  The policy of the Justice Department in federal cases is that a president can't be criminally [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=282.68s)]
*  prosecuted while in office and I think that policy will be extended to the civil case [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=286.66s)]
*  should the Georgia courts try and do anything. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyQUjxWTOvk&t=292.64s)]
