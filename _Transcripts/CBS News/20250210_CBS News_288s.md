# Potential mass layoffs at FBI as tensions run high during Trump era
**CBS News:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU)
*  More shake-ups are expected at the Department of Justice. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=0.0s)]
*  Today begins Pam Bondi's first full week as attorney general. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  It's expected to come with new policies and initiatives to revamp the department. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=6.08s)]
*  CBS News Homeland Security correspondent Nicole Skanga joins us now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=10.64s)]
*  Nicole, thanks for being with us. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=14.4s)]
*  I want to start with these potential mass layoffs at the FBI. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=16.4s)]
*  What do we know? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=20.68s)]
*  Yeah, Kelly, good to be with you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=21.68s)]
*  Tensions at the FBI have really come to a head after the Trump administration requested [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=23.32s)]
*  the names of thousands of agents that were assigned to work on January 6th-related investigations. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=27.6s)]
*  There have since been some reassurances from the administration that it's going to review [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=34.0s)]
*  agents' conduct and not necessarily fire these agents en masse. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=38.72s)]
*  But President Trump did say on Friday that he intended to fire some of the FBI personnel [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=43.36s)]
*  who worked on the Capitol riot cases, and he called them corrupt without offering any [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=48.84s)]
*  evidence or specifics. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  But he did say the department would remove some FBI agents quickly and very surgically. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=55.08s)]
*  It remains to be seen exactly how all of this will shake out. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=61.32s)]
*  Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll has told his workforce that they cannot be legally [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=65.56s)]
*  fired without due process. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=70.96s)]
*  All of this happening, of course, as FBI agents are suing the Justice Department. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=73.24s)]
*  They won a legal agreement last week, preventing anyone in the government from publicly releasing [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=77.8s)]
*  the names of those thousands of FBI employees who did participate in the January 6th cases. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=83.5s)]
*  Of course, in this case, FBI agents had cited safety concerns linked to exposing their identities [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=90.18s)]
*  here to the public. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=96.58s)]
*  And the Department of Justice is also trying to restore Elon Musk's allies' access to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=98.58s)]
*  Treasury payment systems. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=103.72s)]
*  Of course, there was concern around who had access, what they might be able to do with [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=105.22s)]
*  that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=109.46000000000001s)]
*  Why are they trying to restore it? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=110.46000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, lawyers for the Trump administration pushed back late last night in a court order [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=111.89999999999999s)]
*  blocking Elon Musk's aides from entering the Treasury Department's payment systems [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=116.61999999999999s)]
*  and data systems. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=122.08s)]
*  The administration now is arguing this order really infringes on the president's absolute [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=123.61999999999999s)]
*  powers over the executive branch. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=129.14s)]
*  All of this in response to a lawsuit that was filed Friday night by 19 state attorneys [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=131.66s)]
*  general. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=137.14s)]
*  That lawsuit basically claims that Trump's administration, this policy of allowing appointees [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=138.46s)]
*  and special government employees access to these systems, which of course contains sensitive [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=143.44s)]
*  information, bank details, Social Security numbers, is unlawful. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=148.66s)]
*  And the judge granted a temporary stay Saturday blocking that access. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=153.54000000000002s)]
*  To get our viewers up to speed, members of Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=158.66s)]
*  really more of a White House task force than it is a department, had been scouring these [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=163.74s)]
*  databases to find government expenses to cut. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=167.9s)]
*  The lawsuit that I mentioned on Friday night argues the Constitution's separation of powers [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=171.22s)]
*  prevents this kind of work. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=176.46s)]
*  In other words, Congress is meant to determine government spending. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=177.82s)]
*  As part of that stay, a federal judge on Saturday ordered Doge personnel to immediately destroy [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=181.62s)]
*  any and all copies of material downloaded from the Treasury Department's records and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=188.54000000000002s)]
*  systems. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=192.9s)]
*  Now federal lawyers defending Mr. Trump and the Treasury Department say the court should [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=193.9s)]
*  dismiss or at least modify that ruling. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=197.88s)]
*  Kelly. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=200.92s)]
*  Yeah, I find that all very interesting because how this shakes out will set a precedent for [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=201.92s)]
*  the number of things that Doge, the president, wants to do with any number of agencies where [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=207.56s)]
*  you have access to that sensitive information. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=212.32s)]
*  But before I let you go, I want to talk about this because the Justice Department will resume [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=215.2s)]
*  pursuing the federal death penalty. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=220.24s)]
*  What does this entail involving the dozens of federal inmates which former President [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=222.84s)]
*  Biden spared? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, there were two memos signed last week by Attorney General Pam Bondi related to the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=228.16s)]
*  death penalty. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=232.0s)]
*  One lifts that moratorium on federal executions that was put in place by the last administration. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=233.32000000000002s)]
*  So basically instructs federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in cases involving [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  the murder of a law enforcement official and capital crimes committed by those who are [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=244.14000000000001s)]
*  here in the U.S. illegally. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=248.66000000000003s)]
*  Now in his final days in office, President Biden commuted the death sentences of 37 people [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=250.36s)]
*  on death row to life in prison. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=256.24s)]
*  The Bondi memo now directs the Justice Department to assist local prosecutors in pursuing death [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=259.03999999999996s)]
*  sentences under state law against these 37 individuals. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=264.96s)]
*  And beyond that, that memo directed the U.S. Bureau of Prisons to ensure those inmates' [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=269.48s)]
*  prison conditions while they're on death row are consistent with the security risks they [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=274.64s)]
*  present. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  She cited their, quote, egregious crimes. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=280.59999999999997s)]
*  Nicole, thank you so much for breaking all of that down for us. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=282.8s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=286.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWnM_MbIWU&t=287.16s)]
