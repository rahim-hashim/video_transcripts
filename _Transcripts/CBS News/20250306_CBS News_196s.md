# U.S. pauses intelligence sharing with Ukraine
**CBS News:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78)
*  We turn now to our focus on the ongoing war in Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=0.0s)]
*  The Trump administration confirms [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=3.12s)]
*  it has stopped intelligence sharing with Kiev. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=4.92s)]
*  Now, this suspension follows the White House's decision [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=7.84s)]
*  to also put a pause on military aid to the war-torn country. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=10.32s)]
*  We have taken a step back and are pausing and reviewing [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=14.32s)]
*  all aspects of this relationship. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=20.52s)]
*  Meanwhile, Russia has launched more aerial attacks [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=25.04s)]
*  across Ukraine overnight, with a missile striking [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=27.16s)]
*  a hotel in President Zelensky's hometown of Krivyi Rih, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=29.68s)]
*  killing at least four people and injuring dozens more. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=33.76s)]
*  MTS Tyab continues his reporting out of Kiev and joins us now. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=37.32s)]
*  MTS, good morning to you. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=40.44s)]
*  How is Ukraine responding to this US decision [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=42.24s)]
*  to halt intelligence sharing? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=45.12s)]
*  Al, good morning to you. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  Well, it's, of course, very concerning. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=50.96s)]
*  Ukrainians here rely very heavily on the US [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=52.92s)]
*  to provide them with intelligence [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=55.6s)]
*  of Russian movements across the front lines [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=57.48s)]
*  and, more importantly, where to target. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=60.919999999999995s)]
*  And the fact that that information has [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=62.72s)]
*  offensively come to a pause or a halt, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=64.36s)]
*  however the Trump administration is describing it, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=67.4s)]
*  it's very concerning. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=69.92s)]
*  But as you heard in that soundbite during your introduction, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=70.96s)]
*  the Trump administration has confirmed [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=75.2s)]
*  that it has paused intelligence sharing with Ukraine. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=77.0s)]
*  It also follows the suspension of billions of dollars [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=79.92s)]
*  in military aid. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=83.44s)]
*  We learned that just on Monday. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=84.68s)]
*  And now we're hearing from US European command [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=86.52s)]
*  that it's that shipments, rather, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  of Biden administration approved arms not yet delivered [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=91.36s)]
*  have been paused as well. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=95.36s)]
*  Now we've been speaking to Ukraine's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=97.32s)]
*  former Deputy Prime Minister Ivana Klimpush-Tisansade [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=98.88s)]
*  who told us any talk of a ceasefire with Russia [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=102.88s)]
*  would only give time for the Kremlin to regroup, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=105.88s)]
*  rearm and reinvade. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  Here's what she said. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=110.52s)]
*  Is that the fear? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=112.44s)]
*  Unfortunately, I do not see the readiness [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=114.44s)]
*  of the Russian Federation to really engage. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  You know that every single night [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  we are under a terroristic attack of the Russian Federation. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=121.44s)]
*  So that is not something that is showing goodwill [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=126.44s)]
*  of terminating this attacks. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=130.44s)]
*  And to illustrate that point, MTRs, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=134.16s)]
*  there were more overnight attacks, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=136.32s)]
*  including the hometown of Vladimir Zelensky. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=138.44s)]
*  Can you just update us on where the fighting stands right now? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, those attacks have only intensified. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=147.56s)]
*  As we've been saying, the Eastern city of Krivyi Rih, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=150.16s)]
*  which again is president Vladimir Zelensky's hometown [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  was targeted by a Russian ballistic missile. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=155.48s)]
*  In a post on social media, Mr. Zelensky said [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  among the damaged building was a hotel full of aid workers, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=160.6s)]
*  including some Americans. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=163.92s)]
*  We understand at least 30 people were injured in the attack [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=165.56s)]
*  and at least four people were killed. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=168.92s)]
*  But this really follows a week of intense bombardment [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=171.72s)]
*  from Russia as this relationship between the US and Ukraine [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=175.04s)]
*  was really spiraling. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=179.32s)]
*  Almost every night we have these massive drone attacks [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=180.68s)]
*  here on Kiv and in other parts of the country. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  And now this ballistic missile attack from Russia as well, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=186.28s)]
*  which is only causing real concern here. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  Errol. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=192.76s)]
*  All right, MTS, sayab, live for us in Kiv. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=193.6s)]
*  MTS, thank you. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8rYUCB1c78&t=195.4s)]
