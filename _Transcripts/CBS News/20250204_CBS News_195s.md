# Trump's meeting with Netanyahu could alter course of Hamas ceasefire deal
**CBS News:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk)
*  Joining me now in studio 57 is CBS News Middle East reporter Courtney Keeley. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=0.0s)]
*  So this is President Trump's first in-person meeting with another foreign leader since taking [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=3.6s)]
*  office for a second time. What message does this send to the region? Well, it really shows that [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=8.32s)]
*  Israel comes first. That's plain and simple. Israel comes first. It's a critical time. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  The Middle East envoy for Mr. Trump, Steve Goodkoff, met with Mr. Netanyahu on the 16th [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=18.16s)]
*  day yesterday, the 16th day of this very long 42-day phase one. But they're not just talking [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=24.56s)]
*  about a ceasefire and the war for, you know, to end for the Israelis and the Palestinians, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=32.8s)]
*  which is something Mr. Trump has said. They're talking about the looming threat of Iranian [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=38.48s)]
*  nuclear plants actually coming up to being fully capable of producing a nuclear weapon. And many [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=44.16s)]
*  analysis that I have spoken to say that right now it's critical whether negotiations are going to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=51.28s)]
*  happen, any diplomacy is going to work, or they're going to have to be strikes on some of these deep [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  bunkers. And the third thing is, is releasing the aid that Mr. Biden, former President Biden, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=62.72s)]
*  did stop at the end of his presidency. There's about $8 billion on the table of weapons, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=69.2s)]
*  including those 2,000-pound bombs the U.S. made that were used in Gaza. Not only that, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=74.64s)]
*  but it's a question of these two gentlemen eight years ago sung each other's praises. Mr. Netanyahu [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=81.2s)]
*  said that they felt, I'm paraphrasing here, practically finished each other's sentences. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=87.76s)]
*  Are we still there? You know, Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, his family is very close to the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=93.12s)]
*  Netanyahu family, but eight years makes a big difference and Prime Minister Netanyahu is really [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=100.32s)]
*  on the ropes right now in terms of his own leadership. Let's talk about phase two because [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=104.96s)]
*  you mentioned yesterday was day 16, right, of this 42 day. Still fragile. Help us understand how we get [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=108.72s)]
*  from phase one to phase two. What has to happen? Well, they need to get to the negotiating table, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=114.55999999999999s)]
*  and Netanyahu's here, not in Qatar. Not his people aren't in Qatar yet. They were supposed to be there [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  yesterday. 16th day was the day. Instead, he was meeting with the U.S. Middle East envoy, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=123.52s)]
*  Steve Witkoff. So what the Prime Minister has to do is he has to have this meeting, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=129.68s)]
*  you know, have this world stage with the President of the United States, and then he's got to get his [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  people to Qatar, and those negotiations have to start again. We're hearing from the President [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  that he might, he thinks that the deal might not be what he wanted, but the deal is not set in stone. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=144.72s)]
*  It's still part of the negotiations. We're getting to day 16 took this whole time, and it took [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=151.6s)]
*  what the President, former President Biden, was sitting on for a long time until we, you know, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=159.12s)]
*  just a couple of days before President Trump became President was when the deal was sealed, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=165.52s)]
*  showing that the Prime Minister, Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israelis were more willing to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=171.6s)]
*  work with this administration than the past administration. So you can see that President [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=176.08s)]
*  Trump doesn't want the ownership of what the Biden administration had laid out, but really looking at [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=180.96s)]
*  can we get through phase one by 42 days? Can we even get to phase two? And then phase three would [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=186.48s)]
*  be the rebuilding. Okay. Courtney Keeley, thank you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0obS66L81vk&t=191.83999999999997s)]
