# Trump says negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will begin "immediately"
**CBS News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA)
*  Hello and thank you for joining us. President Trump says negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will begin immediately. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=0.0s)]
*  The president says he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Throughout the campaign, President Trump repeatedly said he could end the war in one day. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=9.6s)]
*  Here's what he told reporters earlier at the White House. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=14.0s)]
*  I think we're on the way to getting peace. I think President Putin wants peace and President Zelensky wants peace and I want peace. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=17.2s)]
*  I just want to see people stop getting killed. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=26.2s)]
*  President Trump says he will likely meet with Putin in Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=29.0s)]
*  He also said he agreed with his defense secretary, Pete Hegson, that NATO membership for Ukraine is not practical. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=32.6s)]
*  Following his call with Putin, President Trump also spoke with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky about peace talks. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=40.2s)]
*  Zelensky posted on X saying in part, quote, No one wants peace more than Ukraine. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  Together with the US, we are charting our next steps to stop Russian aggression and ensure a lasting, reliable peace. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=51.2s)]
*  As President Trump said, let's get it done. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=57.6s)]
*  All these conversations come one day after President Trump welcomed American Mark Vogel back to the US. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=60.4s)]
*  He was held in Russia for four years. CBS News reporter Erica Brown joins us now. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=65.6s)]
*  So Erica, what is the White House saying about what these negotiations will look like and who will be involved? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=70.8s)]
*  Well, Lindsey, the White House is essentially saying that these negotiations will commence immediately. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=77.0s)]
*  As you mentioned, this comes after the president's call with Russian President Vladimir Putin today, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=82.0s)]
*  where he said that conversation was lengthy and productive. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=86.8s)]
*  This was their first confirmed conversation since the president returned to the White House. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=89.6s)]
*  And then his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky saying that no one wants peace more than Ukraine. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  But these negotiations would essentially help broker an end to the war. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=100.8s)]
*  And what we know is that they will likely be led by a few members of his cabinet, including a secretary of state, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=104.8s)]
*  CIA Director John Radcliffe, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=111.0s)]
*  And as you mentioned, it's important to note that all of this comes after Secretary of Defense Pete Hegs have said in Brussels [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=117.2s)]
*  that Ukraine's goal to recover some of its lost territory was, quote, unrealistic. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=122.8s)]
*  We heard there the president agreeing with the secretary of defense and essentially ruling out any future membership for Ukraine with NATO. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=127.4s)]
*  On Tuesday, the president welcomed back American Mark Fogel from Russian captivity. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=136.6s)]
*  Since then, the U.S. announced three more detainees, including an unnamed American, were released from Russian ally Belarus. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=140.0s)]
*  What is the U.S. giving in exchange? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=146.4s)]
*  Well, the United States has released a crypto criminal, Alexander Vinnick, in exchange for that release of Mark Fogel, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  that American teacher that was held in a Russian prison for nearly three and a half years, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=156.2s)]
*  returning to the United States just last evening where he met with President Trump at the White House. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  Now, Vinnick was a Russian cyber criminal. He entered a guilty plea last year. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=165.7s)]
*  It was slated to be sentenced this June. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=170.2s)]
*  But a White House official tells CBS News that Mark Fogel's release was not a condition for any of the conversations [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=173.2s)]
*  or future meetings between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=179.9s)]
*  Our own Weijia Zhang asked President Trump about this specifically. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=184.4s)]
*  Trump said that the release of Fogel was a good gesture by Russian President Vladimir Putin, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=188.29999999999998s)]
*  but was not a condition in terms of conversations and future meetings. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=194.3s)]
*  Neither were a condition of his release. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=197.70000000000002s)]
*  Lindsay? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=199.5s)]
*  Erica Brown, thank you. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  Later this hour, we'll talk to our Charlie Dagata for more on President Trump's plans for peace in Ukraine. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbe97aFKqBA&t=202.10000000000002s)]
