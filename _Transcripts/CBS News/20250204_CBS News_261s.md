# Tulsi Gabbard survives Senate committee vote
**CBS News:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc)
*  The full Senate is now set to vote on two of President Trump's more controversial nominees. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=0.0s)]
*  The Senate Intelligence Committee today advanced Tulsi Gabbard to a full vote to become national [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=6.16s)]
*  intelligence director. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=10.28s)]
*  Earlier today, the Senate Finance Committee moved forward with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=11.76s)]
*  nomination to be Health and Human Services Secretary. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=15.6s)]
*  Gabbard and Kennedy could face a full confirmation vote as soon as this week. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=18.76s)]
*  CBS News congressional reporter Torian Small joins us now from Capitol Hill. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=22.2s)]
*  Torian, how did Gabbard convince the intelligence community to support her nomination? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  Well, we're learning that there was an intense pressure campaign from the Trump administration [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  to these wayward Republican senators. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  Todd Young of Indiana was just reportedly on the fence with Gabbard, for example. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=38.72s)]
*  We then saw Elon Musk take to social media platform and call him a deep state puppet. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=45.08s)]
*  That was before he had a conversation with the Indiana senator, which he then pulled [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=50.84s)]
*  back to those words and put out a statement saying that he's encouraged by the conversation [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=56.04s)]
*  that he had and ultimately a vote that was favorable to the president. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=60.88s)]
*  Look, these are two nominees who has quite a bit of controversy surrounding them when [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=66.08s)]
*  it comes to Gabbard, her recent and previous mistrust of the intel community and spreading [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  of information that many of these senators felt were just unbecoming of a person fit [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=79.92s)]
*  to lead the intel community gave them pause in her confirmation hearing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=85.32s)]
*  There was bipartisan trepidation to her response on whether or not she believed Edward Snowden [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=90.6s)]
*  was a traitor. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=97.72s)]
*  In fact, Senator Lankford pressed her several times, at least three times to answer whether [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=98.91999999999999s)]
*  or not she believed that he was a traitor. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=104.52s)]
*  And she just refused to answer that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=107.32s)]
*  She did, though, reassure members of that panel. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  And she ultimately gave her word to senators at large that as the lead of the Department [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=112.44s)]
*  of National Intelligence, she's working to ensure transparency and unbiased information [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=118.8s)]
*  received into the department, but also spread to the ranks here in Congress. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  What did Kennedy move through? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=130.48s)]
*  Well, he got the support of Bill Cassidy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=133.44s)]
*  He was not only the most ranking Republican member on the Senate Health Education Labor [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=136.64s)]
*  Impensions Committee, but he's also a medical doctor. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=145.0s)]
*  And he told him at the end of his confirmation hearing last week that he was struggling to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=147.83999999999997s)]
*  go forward with his confirmation because of his previous comments on the efficacy of vaccinations. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=152.67999999999998s)]
*  For example, one of many things that he disagreed with him on. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=160.92s)]
*  He said in a post on social media that between extended conversations he had with Kennedy [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=164.06s)]
*  over the weekend, the White House, and specifically Vice President J.D. Vance, who's kind of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=169.34s)]
*  worked as a liaison between the Trump administration and the senators, he came to a conclusion [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=175.1s)]
*  that he felt comfortable lending his support and ultimately voting him out of committee. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=180.02s)]
*  Looks like all of Trump's nominees may end up getting confirmed. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=185.82s)]
*  What does this tell you about the party right now and about the White House's influence? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=187.9s)]
*  It shows that there are fewer and fewer Republicans willing to break rank and disagree with the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=193.3s)]
*  public or with the president publicly. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=198.66000000000003s)]
*  And Cassidy's case, he's up for reelection in 2026. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  He knows that that is a state, Louisiana, who voted overwhelmingly 20 plus points for [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=206.22s)]
*  Donald Trump in the previous presidential election. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=212.34s)]
*  And it appears that he's unwilling to rock the boat at this pivotal point in his political [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=215.62s)]
*  career. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=222.14000000000001s)]
*  We've also seen other Republicans who have bemoaned the fact that there is this intense [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=223.98s)]
*  pressure campaign from folks in Trump's world, especially from the likes of Elon Musk, who [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=228.85999999999999s)]
*  has been brought on into this administration but was previously just the CEO or the leader [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=234.45999999999998s)]
*  of the social media site. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=241.1s)]
*  That alliance has been pretty crucial in undermining the independent thought of some of these Republicans. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=243.7s)]
*  Ultimately, many of them falling in line in order to stay in the good graces of not [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=250.38s)]
*  just Donald Trump but many folks in his Trump world. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=255.7s)]
*  Torian Small, thank you. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0UnRdt7Bc&t=258.74s)]
