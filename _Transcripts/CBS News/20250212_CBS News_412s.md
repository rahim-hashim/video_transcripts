# Trump speaks to Russia's Putin, Ukraine's Zelenskyy
**CBS News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec)
*  Also watching this on CBS News 24 seven moments ago, White House press secretary Caroline [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=0.0s)]
*  Levin answering the questions that you want to get answers to, including on that prisoner [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=5.18s)]
*  swap with Russia. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=9.72s)]
*  And of course, that phone call between President Donald Trump and the Russian president, Vladimir [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=10.72s)]
*  Putin. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=16.8s)]
*  So let's go ahead and listen into a little bit of that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  As you know, this morning, the president spoke to President Putin of Russia. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=20.96s)]
*  They spoke at length and the president released a statement following that conversation in [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=26.72s)]
*  great detail. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=31.34s)]
*  I can also confirm that the president just recently got off the phone with President [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=32.339999999999996s)]
*  Zelenskyy of Ukraine. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=36.84s)]
*  His truth is as follows. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=38.9s)]
*  I just spoke to President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=40.3s)]
*  The conversation went very well. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=43.14s)]
*  He like President Putin wants to make peace. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=45.36s)]
*  We discussed a variety of topics having to do with the war, but mostly the meeting that [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=48.36s)]
*  is being set up on Friday in Munich, where Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=53.239999999999995s)]
*  State Marco Rubio will lead the delegation. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=59.3s)]
*  I am hopeful that the results of that meeting will be positive. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=62.099999999999994s)]
*  It is time to stop this ridiculous war where there has been massive and totally unnecessary [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=65.47999999999999s)]
*  death and destruction. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=70.9s)]
*  God bless the people of Russia and Ukraine. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=72.84s)]
*  I myself just spoke to the president about these calls and he told me to tell all of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=75.56s)]
*  you they were very good calls. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=79.53999999999999s)]
*  They were very positive and the administration is wholeheartedly committed to a peace deal [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=81.48s)]
*  to end once and for all the Russia-Ukraine war. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  So CBS News White House reporter Aaron Navarro, let's break this down forecasting into a meeting [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=90.30000000000001s)]
*  that's about to happen with Vice President J.D. Vance. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=95.10000000000001s)]
*  Who else is going to be in that meeting? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=98.16s)]
*  We know that Secretary of State Marco Rubio will be in that meeting and generally Rubio [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=101.62s)]
*  is part of a team that Trump posted on Truth Social that will help lead these negotiations [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=106.02s)]
*  with Russia and Ukraine to end that war, including Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe will be [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=111.86s)]
*  there, NSA Director Mike Waltz, and Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff, who we have already seen [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=117.6s)]
*  be instrumental when it comes to the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, and he had a pretty [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=123.36s)]
*  significant role in the release of Mark Fogel just last night. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=129.2s)]
*  According to Caroline and President Trump, he has had conversations with both leaders [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=134.06s)]
*  and really signaled at least in his conversation with Putin that this negotiation will get [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=138.86s)]
*  started. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=144.98s)]
*  I think one thing that's important to point out is some of Trump's past comments when [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=145.98s)]
*  it comes to the Russia-Ukraine war, such as him saying that the U.S. should receive some [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=150.18s)]
*  sort of return for the aid it has given Ukraine, as well as Trump saying that parts of Ukraine [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=155.1s)]
*  could be annexed into Russia. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=160.38s)]
*  I think that will really illuminate where these negotiations start, but the White House [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=161.98s)]
*  says that these conversations today with the two leaders were positive and good. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=166.2s)]
*  Alright, Aaron, we also want to play for our viewers something that Caroline Levitt had [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=170.48s)]
*  to say about Elon Musk's doge or Department of Government efficiency, so let's talk about [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=174.28s)]
*  that after we let our viewers hear that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=179.83999999999997s)]
*  I would love for Elon Musk to come to the briefing room. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  That's why we had him go to the Oval Office yesterday, where I think he provided great [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  answers. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=188.88s)]
*  I think he's speaking in layman's terms, speaking common sense to all of you in the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=189.88s)]
*  media, but also to Americans at home, but I would say especially to all of you in the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  media, because I think it's a real fallacy that there's this alleged lack of transparency [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=198.01999999999998s)]
*  when it comes to doge. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=202.78s)]
*  President Trump and Elon Musk have been incredibly transparent on what doge is doing. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=205.18s)]
*  There is an ex-account with the doge handle. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=209.66s)]
*  They are tweeting out what they are doing on a daily basis. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=211.57999999999998s)]
*  They have a website where they are posting the receipts of the contracts that they are [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=214.38s)]
*  reviewing and the payments that they have stopped from going out the door. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=218.48s)]
*  The secretaries of our departments have stopped from going out the door. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=222.24s)]
*  And I would also say that before it was Elon Musk making our government efficient and accountable, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=226.4s)]
*  it was some unnamed bureaucrat that none of you knew. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=231.7s)]
*  Elon Musk is the richest man in the world. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=234.42s)]
*  He's also now one of the most highly scrutinized men in the world alongside President Trump [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  because of what he's doing and the access that he is allowing. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=241.64s)]
*  So there's great transparency. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=244.56s)]
*  As for the actual receipts, we are happy to provide them. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=246.7s)]
*  Alright, so that is what she had to say about doge and some of the criticisms there. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=249.7s)]
*  Elon Musk used the term, speaking to transparency, saying that he expects, quote, a daily proctology [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=254.7s)]
*  exam. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=260.58s)]
*  That's how layman's term that he used. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=261.58s)]
*  But I want to ask you about what Democrats are having to say relative to when they're [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=263.53999999999996s)]
*  talking about the man who is in charge of the Federal Reserve. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=267.82s)]
*  Is there the transparency that Elon Musk is promising to the American people? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=271.06s)]
*  I see a lot of posts on X, but when you go to that website, you don't see the volume [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=275.06s)]
*  of things that were told on that website. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=279.62s)]
*  And that seems to be what Caroline was trying to address in part by pulling up receipts, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=284.12s)]
*  in her words, of these contracts that have been terminated as part of Doge's efforts. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=289.48s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=295.2s)]
*  I mean, some of the transparency questions are definitely still there, just especially [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=296.2s)]
*  with all the federal employees that have been impacted. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=299.44s)]
*  Those that CBS News have talked to have described a sense of confusion regarding what's going [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=302.74s)]
*  to happen next with their agency, looking at USAID as well as the CFPB Bureau. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=307.02000000000004s)]
*  So certainly in that aspect, not as much transparency. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=313.90000000000003s)]
*  And it was striking, too, when Elon Musk was in the Oval Office yesterday as he brought [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=316.90000000000003s)]
*  up these examples, how he was kind of combining disagreements when it comes to government [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=321.18s)]
*  waste and saying that there are, quote, fraudsters out there gaming the system for their own [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=325.66s)]
*  personal gain. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=330.82000000000005s)]
*  Those are also things that we have not seen evidence of yet, but are asking the White House for. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=332.06s)]
*  We know it's a mix of former Trump officials, as well as a lot of younger 20s around the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=356.34000000000003s)]
*  age, engineers that have had some connections to Musk's companies. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=362.02s)]
*  We know that one of them actually had access to not only reading information in the Department [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=366.56s)]
*  of Treasury, but according to an affidavit, at one point he had access to edit that information. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=372.96s)]
*  That permission was revoked from him. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=378.58s)]
*  But certainly as his team has been working in offices and basements of these agencies, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=382.14s)]
*  we've heard reports just from staffers that they tend to be on the younger side, but certainly [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=387.92s)]
*  people that don't necessarily have a breadth of experience working in the government and [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=393.1s)]
*  the bureaucracy. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=398.12s)]
*  Yeah, and I know Caroline Levitt is trying to get us to look at those receipts. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=399.12s)]
*  That is a valid conversation to have, but how those receipts are being acquired is also [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=402.6s)]
*  an important conversation. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=407.20000000000005s)]
*  Aaron, it's nice to talk to you today on CBS News 24-7 and all days. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQv3XEO2Lec&t=408.20000000000005s)]
