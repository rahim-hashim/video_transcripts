# Trump administration moves to end New York City's congestion pricing
**CBS News:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8)
*  Breaking right now an update on those congestion prices over in New York City. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8&t=0.0s)]
*  Our partners there reporting on that news just moments ago. Let's listen to that. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8&t=5.0s)]
*  I'm Jessica Moore with Breaking News. We have just learned the Trump administration is pulling the approval for congestion pricing. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8&t=9.0s)]
*  The Department of Transportation is sending a letter to Governor Hokel this afternoon saying it is quote backward and unfair. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8&t=16.0s)]
*  We have a copy of that letter. It says it's not a fair deal. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8&t=23.0s)]
*  Everyone should have access to the city, not just the elite. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8&t=26.0s)]
*  Congressman Mike Lawler tells our Marsha Kramer he was informed today that the decision had been made to end the toll that just went into effect on January 5th. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8&t=30.0s)]
*  As you know, charges drivers $9 to drive into Manhattan's central business district. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8&t=39.0s)]
*  And Marsha joins us now with more. Marsha, we barely had one month of this and now it's just, it's over. Is it that simple? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8&t=45.0s)]
*  Well, the thing about it is this, that President Trump made a promise on the campaign trail that he was going to end congestion pricing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8&t=52.0s)]
*  And today the people who wanted him to make that promise are saying, thank God he made the promise. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8&t=59.0s)]
*  However, you know, there's two sides of this. The people who are transfer transportation alternatives and others are quite upset and vowing to fight this with every ounce of their being. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8&t=64.0s)]
*  But I have to tell you this, the reasoning behind it is very simple. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8&t=76.0s)]
*  What the transportation department is doing, actually, it's a federal highway administration. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8&t=79.0s)]
*  They're basically saying several things. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8&t=83.0s)]
*  One, it's harmful to small businesses who depend on business from Connecticut and New Jersey. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8&t=85.0s)]
*  They're also taking issue with the toll itself because they say the toll was, according to the MTA, is to raise money for transportation. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8&t=91.0s)]
*  And according to environmental studies, it should be a toll to reduce congestion. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8&t=99.0s)]
*  So they take issue with the whole idea that it's revenue for other projects. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8&t=103.0s)]
*  But how the money is being used, essentially, right? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8&t=107.0s)]
*  And how the toll is being used and how it was set. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8&t=109.0s)]
*  And they also say it makes New York the most expensive city in the nation to come into the city. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8&t=112.0s)]
*  Right. So when they say that, and we're hearing from our partners there in New York City talking about congestion prices, we'll continue to follow this developing story for you. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIS1sqqaDK8&t=118.0s)]
