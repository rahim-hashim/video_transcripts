# Melting ice may slow Earth's strongest ocean current, research shows
**CBS News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8)
*  A powerful ocean current crucial to our global climate is slowing down and scientists are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=0.0s)]
*  pointing to melting ice sheets as the cause. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=4.8s)]
*  So what does this mean for us and for the environment? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  CBS News Los Angeles meteorologist and climatologist Marina Jerica joins us now to explain. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=10.0s)]
*  Marina, why is this ocean current so important for our climate? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=14.56s)]
*  Well, we are talking about the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which is Earth's strongest and most [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=17.76s)]
*  significant ocean current. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=24.72s)]
*  To put it into perspective for you, it moves around 165 to 182 million cubic meters of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=26.48s)]
*  water per second. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=33.44s)]
*  It helps move heat, carbon and nutrients around the globe and regulates ocean temperatures [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=35.24s)]
*  worldwide. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=40.84s)]
*  When it slows down, it can disrupt global climate patterns, causing more extreme weather [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=41.84s)]
*  and reduce the ocean's ability to absorb carbon, which speeds up global warming. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=47.28s)]
*  It also allows invasive species to enter Antarctic waters, threatening those very fragile [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=52.26s)]
*  ecosystems. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=57.54s)]
*  How are melting ice sheets affecting this current? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=58.54s)]
*  Well, the melting ice is adding fresh water into the ocean, which changes its density [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=61.14s)]
*  and slows down the current. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=66.6s)]
*  This causes more warm water to reach Antarctica, speeding up ice melting and creating a cycle [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=68.86s)]
*  that enhances climate change. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=74.46s)]
*  In a high emissions future, a new study found that the current could slow up to 20% by 2050. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=76.64s)]
*  Wow, so is there any way to prevent this or is it too late? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=83.4s)]
*  Well, in this study, they say the only way to stop this cycle is cut carbon emissions [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=86.52s)]
*  dramatically, which we've been saying for a long time. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=91.48s)]
*  The 2015 Paris Agreement aimed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=94.16s)]
*  Many of us believe we've already hit that mark. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=100.28s)]
*  Without stronger climate action, Antarctic ice will continue to melt at an accelerating [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=102.76s)]
*  rate, making the slowdown of this critical current and its consequences inevitable. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=108.36s)]
*  In my research in Norway this January, I found that the ice sheets are continuing to melt [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=113.92s)]
*  four times faster than the global average. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=118.72s)]
*  We also looked at how increased solar activity has the potential to amplify these warming [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=122.48s)]
*  trends. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=128.24s)]
*  What we're seeing here is that human driven climate change is already so pronounced that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=129.24s)]
*  natural variations like solar cycles may intensify extreme weather patterns rather than counteract [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=133.8s)]
*  them. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=140.84s)]
*  So it's imperative we make these changes that we have control over now to minimize the melting. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=141.84s)]
*  We shall be paying attention to this. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=147.24s)]
*  Marina Jerica, thank you so much. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxpXbeRm1t8&t=149.04000000000002s)]
