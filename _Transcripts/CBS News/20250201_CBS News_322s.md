*  Two of the airport's three runways will be closed as crews work to pull the plane's fuselage from the Potomac River. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=20.16s)]
*  CBS News senior transportation correspondent Chris Van Cleave is at Reagan National Airport and joins us now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=26.799999999999997s)]
*  Chris, good morning. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=32.16s)]
*  Well, good morning. More than 100 flights cancelled yesterday because of those runways being closed. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=36.4s)]
*  There was also a decision announced by the Secretary of Transportation to indefinitely [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=42.64s)]
*  close the airspace around Washington Reagan National Airport to helicopter traffic because [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=47.92s)]
*  of this deadly crash. Now the NTSB hopes to begin the process of salvaging wreckage, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=54.4s)]
*  pulling it out of the water and getting it onto barges as soon as today. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  Crews have recovered at least 41 bodies from the wreckage of the American Airlines regional jet [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=67.52s)]
*  and Army Black Hawk helicopter sitting in the Potomac. They're waiting for additional equipment [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=72.4s)]
*  to pull pieces of fuselage from the river in the hopes of reaching the unaccounted for. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  Video captured the moment the chopper slammed into the side of Flight 5342 [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=82.72s)]
*  as it was on final approach to Washington's Reagan National Airport. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  It appears the helicopter was flying nearly 200 feet higher than it should have been [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=91.52s)]
*  at the time of the crash. As a pilot, you never stop flying. He didn't give up all the way to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=96.0s)]
*  the ground or all the way to the water. He would have been moving those controls and trying to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=100.8s)]
*  figure out what's going on. Tim Lilly's son Sam was the first officer on Flight 5342. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=105.2s)]
*  The 28-year-old was engaged to be married. That very day his family was picking out wedding venues. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=111.76s)]
*  His father Tim is also a former Black Hawk pilot who says he's flown that very route many times. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  It didn't look to me like the helicopter either understood where the where the CRJ was or, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  you know, they made a mistake. How are you remembering your son today? You know Sam, Sam, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=132.88s)]
*  I consider Sam a spirit that was living in an earthly body and now he's back in his spirit body. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=139.6s)]
*  As the Lilly family and those of 66 others lost in the crash wait for answers, NTSB investigators [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=150.0s)]
*  have begun the grim and painstaking process of combing through the wreckage and soon sifting [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=156.24s)]
*  through data from the black boxes recovered from the icy Potomac. NTSB board member Todd Inman. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=161.6s)]
*  How confident are you the voice recorder you'll be able to salvage what's on there? So the CRJ-700 [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=167.84s)]
*  commercial plane, its voice recorder whenever it came in of course had some water intrusions, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=172.8s)]
*  not unusual at all. In fact it's sometimes rare not to see something damaged. We feel very good [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  about the potential to being able to get a full download from that from everything we've seen. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=185.28s)]
*  Just the day before Wednesday's deadly crash another regional jet about to land at Reagan had [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=189.6s)]
*  a close call. The pilots received an alert from the onboard collision avoidance system [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=194.64s)]
*  about a military helicopter and aborted the landing attempt. CBS News has identified at least four [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=202.88s)]
*  other close calls between helicopters and planes around the airport including a 2018 incident where [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=208.72s)]
*  a pilot took last second evasive maneuvers to avoid an FAA plane landing on the same runway [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=214.56s)]
*  the jet from Wichita was cleared to land on this week. In this previously unreported case [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=221.12s)]
*  a controller failed to warn the two aircraft in advance. Chris as we are learning more you [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=226.32s)]
*  mentioned there's still more questions what can you tell us about the staffing in the control tower [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=237.28s)]
*  at the time of the crash? Yeah what we are learning is that while that the staffing was deemed [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=241.52s)]
*  not normal and while sources tell us it was adequate to operate the airport you had two [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=250.72s)]
*  different controllers doing the jobs of two people to say it another way two people doing the jobs [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=257.28s)]
*  of four people one of those controllers was handling helicopter traffic and also assisting [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=262.72s)]
*  with planes taking off and landing a job that would normally be done by two people at that time [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=270.72s)]
*  of day. What are the next steps in the investigation Chris? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=275.52s)]
*  Yeah so the NTSB is waiting on some barges and some some cranes some some lifting equipment [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=282.79999999999995s)]
*  to arrive it should be in place today once those barges are anchored in the right places they've [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=289.76s)]
*  been using sonars to map the debris field they will start to remove the wreckage from the water [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=295.68s)]
*  the DC fire chief says they believe the wreckage has to come out of the water in order for them [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=301.28s)]
*  to access the the remaining unaccounted for bodies so that is also part of this effort and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=305.44s)]
*  right now the primary focus is trying to recover as many of the unaccounted for as possible. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  All right Chris and Cleve at Reagan National thank you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7AUAmxcnW4&t=318.8s)]
