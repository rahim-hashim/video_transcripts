# Netanyahu's response on U.S. soldiers in Gaza for Trump's plan
**CBS News:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU)
*  Well, first with the president, next with members of Congress. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=0.0s)]
*  We're talking about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's very busy schedule. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=3.44s)]
*  Right now, he's headed for a face-to-face sit-down with top House Republican Speaker [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=6.94s)]
*  Mike Johnson. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=10.96s)]
*  The big talking point, the president's thoughts about the U.S. taking over the Gaza Strip [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=11.96s)]
*  potentially, including whether U.S. troops would be boots on the ground to make that [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=16.92s)]
*  plan happen. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=21.44s)]
*  Here's an exchange. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=22.44s)]
*  We wanted to let you hear it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=23.82s)]
*  Mr. Netanyahu, do you think we're in? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=25.82s)]
*  Are we in? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=28.82s)]
*  Are we in? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=30.82s)]
*  No. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=32.82s)]
*  So asking about do you think it's feasible that U.S. boots would be on the ground, he [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=33.82s)]
*  said a very clear no. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=38.82s)]
*  But let's go live to CBS News congressional reporter Torian Smaltorian. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=39.82s)]
*  Congress has the power of the purse. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=43.82s)]
*  Johnson has great power where writing checks are concerned. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=45.82s)]
*  So really, what's Netanyahu's endgame with Congress? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=48.82s)]
*  Yeah, Reid, interesting enough. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=51.82s)]
*  And I looked down to check recent notes that we got, readouts of that hearing. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=54.82s)]
*  Democrats coming out of that meeting with Netanyahu said that they didn't actually [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=59.82s)]
*  discuss in detail Trump's proposal for a Gaza takeover by the U.S., nor did they say that [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=63.82s)]
*  there would be a feasible consensus around sending troops to the ground to help see that [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=70.82s)]
*  plan through. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=76.82s)]
*  We just heard Netanyahu say there that succinctly no troops would be needed in order for this [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=77.82s)]
*  plan to happen. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=83.82s)]
*  What I'm imagining happen though, as Netanyahu makes his rounds around Capitol Hill, he's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=84.82s)]
*  looking to encourage lawmakers to continue with allyship through support, especially [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=90.82s)]
*  as the government looks through this drastic reformation. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=97.82s)]
*  We see USAID at the center, a lot of controversy around here as Elon Musk looks to make slashes [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=101.82s)]
*  through the Department of Government Efficiency or DOJ. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=108.82s)]
*  He wants to reaffirm that the U.S. has Israel's back and further aid won't be in jeopardy, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=111.82s)]
*  like we're seeing across the board. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=118.82s)]
*  Well, we also know that the president who's taking cues from Elon Musk is going into these [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=119.82s)]
*  meetings knowing about those line item issues as he meets with lawmakers who he needs, again, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=123.82s)]
*  to write the checks. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=129.82s)]
*  What could this meeting reveal about Mr. Trump's top priorities? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=131.82s)]
*  Well, the big budget reconciliation is top of mind for President Trump and lawmakers. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=135.82s)]
*  Speaker Johnson, before he headed to the White House, although he's on his way back now to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=142.82s)]
*  meet with Netanyahu, said that he wants one bill, as the president previously called it, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=146.82s)]
*  one big, beautiful bill, but he's hoping to start there with one bill for reconciliation [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=151.82s)]
*  to get a lot of the priorities out of the way. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=155.82s)]
*  On the Senate side, though, there doesn't seem to be the same train of thought. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=158.82s)]
*  Senator Tom Tillis said that he's looking at a couple of ways to get this through. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=163.82s)]
*  He said the House could do its thing. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=168.82s)]
*  The Senate, though, is looking to probably get forth a smaller bill first that would include [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=170.82s)]
*  measures to secure funding for President Trump's U.S.-Mexico southern border, but then also [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=175.82s)]
*  wants to look at those other priorities through how they could approach spending that way, too. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=182.82s)]
*  So it's incongruent, they read. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=187.82s)]
*  You have the House looking at just one measure. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=189.82s)]
*  You have the Senate looking at another. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=192.82s)]
*  Ultimately, they'll have to meet in the middle for this budget reconciliation process to happen effectively. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=193.82s)]
*  Well, and you mentioned government reformation. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=199.82s)]
*  We have to keep in mind that the government is still forming, informed by those confirmation hearings. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=201.82s)]
*  You've got an update on some of those Senate confirmations. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=207.82s)]
*  What's going on there? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=209.82s)]
*  Yeah, so Trump's pick for his next budget chief, Russell Vought, is already clear through committee. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=211.82s)]
*  Republicans passed a procedural vote to get him to the floor, but Democrats are utilizing a procedure [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=219.82s)]
*  that allows them to debate up to 30 hours, from when it started to when it will end. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=225.82s)]
*  That means he could see a full vote on the floor by around 7 p.m. tonight. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=230.82s)]
*  I haven't seen any significant pushback from Republicans. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=235.82s)]
*  So seeing that there probably won't be four defectors, he's all but guaranteed to be the next budget chief for the president. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=238.82s)]
*  Cash Patel is one that we're watching. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=245.82s)]
*  We know that Senator Grassley, who's the head of the Senate Intel Committee, has postponed his vote at a committee. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=247.82s)]
*  We were watching to see what some of those on-defense Republicans will do with this. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=256.82s)]
*  That will determine where it goes. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=261.82s)]
*  But it looks like he has the support there as well. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=262.82s)]
*  What the timing looks like for floor votes is to be seen, but if he is voted out of committee next week, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=265.82s)]
*  we could see that happen, a floor vote, by the end of the week at some time as well. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=273.82s)]
*  All right, 24 hours to go, and then your week is mailed in. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=278.82s)]
*  Torian Small, thank you so much for keeping us updated every minute of this week. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODTr14Z0IU&t=281.82s)]
