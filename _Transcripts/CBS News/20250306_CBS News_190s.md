# How Republicans plan to avoid a government shutdown
**CBS News:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg)
*  Meanwhile, Speaker Mike Johnson is optimistic the House will avoid a government shutdown. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=0.0s)]
*  He says he thinks Republicans have the votes needed ahead of the March 14 deadline. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=4.9s)]
*  Our Scott McFarland is following this for us from our Washington bureau. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=9.32s)]
*  Scott, what can you tell us about the proposal to keep the government funded? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=12.36s)]
*  Scott McFarland, Washington Bureau of Justice Secretary, U.S. Department of Justice [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=15.52s)]
*  Not everybody is on the same page, which may not be a gallivanting surprise, but we're [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=17.0s)]
*  getting down to brass tacks here. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=19.64s)]
*  It's seven days until the government shutdown deadline, and there's no consensus that the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=21.2s)]
*  votes are there. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=26.32s)]
*  Different parties want different things. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=27.6s)]
*  Mike Johnson is trying to get his colleagues behind this short-term continuing resolution, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  as they call it, extend everything the way it's being spent now for, say, another six [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=35.0s)]
*  months or so, closer to the end of the fiscal year. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=38.96s)]
*  Getting Republicans on board with any spending plan has been treacherous over the past few [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=42.32s)]
*  years. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=47.32s)]
*  And with the narrow margins in the U.S. House, it seems they're going to need some Democratic [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=48.32s)]
*  votes. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=51.92s)]
*  And Democrats have a different vision of what should happen. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=52.92s)]
*  They'd like something that binds the administration to actually spend the money the way directed [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=55.72s)]
*  by Congress. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=60.36s)]
*  They believe President Trump has been doing the opposite lately and has been defying Congress. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=61.36s)]
*  So there's no consensus as to how to move forward. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=65.84s)]
*  If there was a consensus, Lindsey, you know, they would have that vote in the next five [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=69.72s)]
*  minutes or so. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=74.16s)]
*  And we are continuing to follow President Trump's plans to dismantle the Department [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=75.16s)]
*  of Education. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=79.28s)]
*  Fully shutting it down can't happen without Congress. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=80.28s)]
*  Does the White House have the support it needs? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=82.44s)]
*  Is the math mapping? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=84.52s)]
*  This is a bit different. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=86.32s)]
*  I mean, there for generations has been call, calls inside the Republican Party to shut [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=87.32s)]
*  down the U.S. Department of Education or to slim it down significantly. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=91.92s)]
*  This has always been a winning issue for Republicans in Congress. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=95.6s)]
*  And some number of Democrats have equivocated about how wide and large the breadth of that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=98.24s)]
*  agency should be. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=103.39999999999999s)]
*  But the problem here is, if Congress has to sign off on this to formally shutter that [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=104.96s)]
*  building and that agency, they have to hook that onto something else that will pass, which [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=109.28s)]
*  brings us back to the original problem. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=114.56s)]
*  How do you get Republicans to agree on anything at this moment if there's not going to be [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=116.64s)]
*  Democratic support? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=120.88000000000001s)]
*  What's the vehicle on which the shutdown of the U.S. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=122.16s)]
*  Department of Education will ride? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  That's the bigger complication. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=127.08s)]
*  Elon Musk was on Capitol Hill yesterday to discuss signing Doge cuts into law, essentially [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=129.52s)]
*  codifying this, saying none of this is permanent, none of this will be worthwhile unless lawmakers [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=135.0s)]
*  are on board. How are lawmakers responding? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=139.2s)]
*  A pretty good range of feedback from Republicans who have been supportive of Elon Musk. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=141.84s)]
*  One Republican from Florida saying that there are some concerns about how fast some of these [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  cuts are coming and how they may be impacting some of the constituents, from veterans hospitals [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  to national parks to the FAA. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=155.56s)]
*  Then you have a congressman from Wisconsin, a Republican who said that Elon Musk has made [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  assurances this won't impact veterans services or farmers as they make cuts, which satisfied [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=162.48s)]
*  some in the room. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=167.95999999999998s)]
*  Congressman from South Carolina saying Elon Musk told the group, nothing's off the table, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=169.28s)]
*  that everything's in play. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=173.88s)]
*  I think the concerns Elon Musk is getting from Republicans are more muted, more subtle, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=175.28s)]
*  more behind closed doors, not that they oppose what's happening, but that they're concerned [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=180.24s)]
*  the immediate impacts could slam their constituents. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=184.24s)]
*  Scott McFarland, thank you so much. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW41xZFPlHg&t=187.72s)]
