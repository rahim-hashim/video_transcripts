*  be more from the same spot. In [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=149.0s)]
*  a brief time. What S. R. O. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=153.0s)]
*  You're on duty and debate? You [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=155.0s)]
*  mean at all? There were two S. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=156.0s)]
*  R. O. S in the building. They [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=158.0s)]
*  were not in the immediate [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=159.0s)]
*  vicinity of the cafeteria when [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=160.0s)]
*  this happened. When by the time [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=163.0s)]
*  the S. R. O. S got down there, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=165.0s)]
*  they were already in the building. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=168.0s)]
*  And I'm not sure what they were [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=170.0s)]
*  doing. I don't know. I don't [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=171.0s)]
*  know. I don't know. I don't [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=173.0s)]
*  know. I don't know. I don't know. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=175.0s)]
*  I will let the school system [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=177.0s)]
*  answer that definitively. I did [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=180.0s)]
*  not see any metal detectors in [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=183.0s)]
*  the building, but I'll let that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=184.0s)]
*  the school system issue to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=187.0s)]
*  address. Well, told us that [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=190.0s)]
*  there's a ticket for an eye [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=192.0s)]
*  injury. It's not a gunshot [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=195.0s)]
*  injury, and I'm not sure if he [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=197.0s)]
*  fell or what was the cause of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=200.0s)]
*  that. But there is a another [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=202.0s)]
*  male student being treated at [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=204.0s)]
*  Vanderbilt who does not have a [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=206.0s)]

*  of a facial injury, the cause [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=210.0s)]
*  of which I'm unsure about. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=212.0s)]
*  Okay. I couldn't hear the last [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=214.0s)]
*  part of your question. No, I [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=217.0s)]
*  can just confirm gender at this [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=220.0s)]

*  team, we've been looking at how [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=342.0s)]
*  often students bring guns into [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=344.0s)]
*  schools and trying to drill down [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=346.0s)]
*  on this, because if there isn't [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=348.0s)]
*  a metal detector... Which we [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=350.0s)]
*  don't know if there is, as he [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=352.0s)]
*  mentioned. Yeah, we don't know [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=353.0s)]
*  if there is. But we still have [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=354.0s)]
*  been covering this over and over. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=356.0s)]
*  You know, the big question is, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=358.0s)]
*  how did that gun get inside the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=359.0s)]
*  school? We've covered students [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=361.0s)]
*  bringing it in their backpacks, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=362.0s)]
*  even a long gun, covering it [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=364.0s)]
*  with a sweatshirt in one case in [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=366.0s)]
*  Georgia last fall. Just the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=369.0s)]
*  prevalence of guns in the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=372.0s)]
*  schools, it's alarming. And just [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=374.0s)]
*  to hear these details, I am [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=376.0s)]
*  impressed with how much [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=378.0s)]
*  information the police were able [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=379.0s)]
*  to give us so quickly. They [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=380.0s)]
*  were able to pivot and put out [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=383.0s)]
*  this information. The FBI field [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=384.0s)]
*  office there, so far they are [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=387.0s)]
*  aware and monitoring, but they [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=389.0s)]
*  have not sent agents. We know [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=390.0s)]
*  the homicide division of the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=391.0s)]
*  local police are handling this [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=393.0s)]
*  case. Is that typical? It [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=395.0s)]
*  depends. You know, when a big [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=397.0s)]
*  school shooting like we just [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=399.0s)]
*  covered in Wisconsin, we did [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=401.0s)]
*  have the FBI field office there [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=404.0s)]
*  immediately. And, you know, in [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=406.0s)]
*  that area, you're going to have [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=407.0s)]
*  agents who could get there [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=409.0s)]
*  pretty quickly. So they're [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=410.0s)]
*  treating this as a homicide. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=412.0s)]
*  A lot of it is the local [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=414.0s)]
*  division will take control [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=416.0s)]
*  initially. This might change [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=418.0s)]
*  moving forward, but they clearly [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=420.0s)]
*  assess the situation. They've [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=423.0s)]
*  had a little bit of time to do [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=424.0s)]
*  it. They've determined it [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=426.0s)]
*  appropriate to pursue as a [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=427.0s)]
*  homicide investigation. And I [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=430.0s)]
*  imagine this is maybe only their [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=431.0s)]
*  first or second, maybe third [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=433.0s)]
*  week back at school from a [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=435.0s)]
*  winter break. Unfortunately, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=437.0s)]
*  this is a question that I often [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=439.0s)]
*  ask you too often, but we heard [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=441.0s)]
*  the officer there saying no [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=443.0s)]
*  motive yet. What will [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=445.0s)]
*  investigators be looking at now [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=446.0s)]
*  to comb through this now that [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=447.0s)]
*  the shooter is deceased? Well, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=448.0s)]
*  they're going to be looking at [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=450.0s)]
*  any interaction between the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=451.0s)]
*  shooter and the two victims. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=452.0s)]
*  They're going to be looking at [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=454.0s)]
*  personal grievances that the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=456.0s)]
*  shooter might have had. They're [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=457.0s)]
*  going to be interviewing [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=459.0s)]
*  everybody around this person. So [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=460.0s)]
*  family members, friends, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=462.0s)]
*  coaches, potentially anyone that [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=463.0s)]
*  that individual interacted with [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=465.0s)]
*  to learn if there were red [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=467.0s)]
*  flags, and they're putting [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=469.0s)]
*  together a timeline. They're [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=470.0s)]
*  also putting together a digital [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=471.0s)]
*  timeline. They are going to [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=473.0s)]
*  look if this shooter posted [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=474.0s)]
*  materials in some online chat [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=477.0s)]
*  room or online platform that [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=479.0s)]
*  would have been sort of an [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=482.0s)]
*  indication that he would carry [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=484.0s)]
*  out a violent act. And, of [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=486.0s)]
*  course, then there's this post [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=488.0s)]
*  mortem. What did we miss? What [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=490.0s)]
*  red flags did we miss? And [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=492.0s)]
*  that's all going into this [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=494.0s)]
*  investigation. And there are [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=495.0s)]
*  going to be multiple agents [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=496.0s)]
*  looking at all of those [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=497.0s)]
*  different things. And they're [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=498.0s)]
*  going to be looking at all of [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juxWR-Bz_KY&t=499.0s)]
