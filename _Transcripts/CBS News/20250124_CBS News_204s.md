# Analyzing Gov. Newsom's fact-checking efforts on wildfires
**CBS News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs)
*  Welcome back to America Decides. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=0.0s)]
*  Thanks for staying with us. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=1.84s)]
*  CBS News Sacramento investigative reporter Julie Watts and the CBS News Confirmed team [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=2.84s)]
*  have combined forces to fact check Governor Gavin Newsom's, that's California Governor [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=8.32s)]
*  Gavin Newsom's website designed to combat what he and others in his administration describe [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=13.36s)]
*  as wildfire misinformation. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=18.56s)]
*  Here's some of what they found. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, Governor Newsom set up his own fact checking website to counter what he calls [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  lies about California's wildfires, but they're not all lies exactly. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=28.32s)]
*  So we asked our CBS News confirmed team to fact check the governor's fact check. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=34.56s)]
*  I ask you, we've got to deal with this misinformation. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=38.68s)]
*  There are hurricane force winds of mis and disinformation lies. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=42.56s)]
*  Misinformation after a disaster is nothing new, but Governor Newsom's approach to combating [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=47.0s)]
*  it certainly is. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=50.6s)]
*  He set up his very own fact check website using his personal domain. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=51.84s)]
*  Interestingly, he never directly fact checks President Trump. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  You might call it social media diplomacy. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=59.32s)]
*  Instead, he fact checks posts from people who echo the president's sentiments. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=61.28s)]
*  While some of his fact checks are easily verifiable, like the Hollywood sign was not on fire, others [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=65.8s)]
*  require some nuance, which brings us to fact check number one. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  Did Governor Newsom cut California's fire budget ahead of the L.A. fires? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=74.52s)]
*  Newsweek was first to publish the headline, but the governor didn't respond until it was [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=78.4s)]
*  picked up by Fox News. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=81.96s)]
*  For stupidity and stunning incompetence from California's Democrat leaders. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=83.72s)]
*  Newsom called the reports that he cut California's fire budget by a hundred million dollars in [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=87.56s)]
*  the months before the fire a ridiculous lie, except it's not a lie. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=91.96s)]
*  Let's start with the governor's fact check. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=97.52s)]
*  It is a fact that since he took office, the number of Cal Fire personnel in Cal Fire's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=99.24s)]
*  budget has increased significantly. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=103.92s)]
*  It did not double. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=106.48s)]
*  It is also a fact that Newsom did cut more than a hundred million dollars in supplemental [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=108.2s)]
*  wildfire related funding last year. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=113.0s)]
*  Here's the budget. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=115.4s)]
*  It includes 12 million in cuts for home hardening, five million for prescribed fires and hand [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=116.4s)]
*  grooves. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=120.8s)]
*  But the bulk of the cuts were for biomass pilot and conservation projects. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=121.8s)]
*  So it's unlikely these cuts would have actually impacted the L.A. fires. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=125.84s)]
*  Now to fact check number two. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=130.76s)]
*  Did California run out of water? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=132.66s)]
*  For the sake of the smell, they have no water. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  They had no water in the fire hydrants today in Los Angeles. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=135.96s)]
*  It was a terrible thing. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=138.48s)]
*  Instead of fact checking the president, the governor fact checked a post from Libs of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=139.96s)]
*  TikTok saying there's no water coming out of the hydrants because the city didn't fill [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  the reservoirs. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=148.0s)]
*  As the governor notes, in fact, the reservoirs in California are full and there's no water [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=149.3s)]
*  shortage in Southern California. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=154.44s)]
*  In fact, state data shows that all but three of California's major reservoirs are at or [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  above historical averages. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  But the 117 million gallon reservoir nearest the Palisades fire was out of service when [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=162.84s)]
*  the fires began. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  Newsom said he's launching an independent investigation. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=170.28s)]
*  Now it's worth noting that the reservoir is not the reason the fire hydrants ran dry. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=173.76s)]
*  According to L.A. city officials, they did have three one million gallon water tanks [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=178.16s)]
*  feeding those hydrants, but those tanks ran out of water by the second morning of the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  firefight. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  They say it wasn't due to a lack of water, but rather unprecedented demand. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  They say they couldn't fill the tanks fast enough to get enough water pressure to then [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  feed back to those hydrants. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=196.44s)]
*  So a lot of important context and nuance here. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyi-A8mEJgs&t=199.16s)]
