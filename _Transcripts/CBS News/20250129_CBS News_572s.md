# RFK Jr. on "Nazi death camps" comments about CDC
**CBS News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA)
*  Senator Warnock. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you so much, Chairman Crapo and Ranking Member Wyden. It's great to be [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=2.6s)]
*  here. Mr. Kennedy, welcome. Welcome to you and to your family. Thank you for meeting [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=8.56s)]
*  with me a few days ago. I'd like to follow up, if I might, with some of the issues that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=15.8s)]
*  we discussed in my office. I want to talk to you first about the CDC or the Centers [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=22.28s)]
*  for Disease Control and Prevention. I'm proud of the work that the CDC does, proud that [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=30.44s)]
*  it's located in Georgia with more than 10,000 employees in my state. If confirmed, you would [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=36.24s)]
*  be the Cabinet Secretary over the CDC. Representing HHS, it's about 29% of the federal budget. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=46.0s)]
*  CDC is a part of that. Do you agree that the CDC's work is critical to Georgia, critical [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=55.44s)]
*  for our country and the health of the entire world? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=62.4s)]
*  Yes, Senator. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=67.08s)]
*  Senator Isakson, my Republican predecessor, would have agreed with that. Bless his memory, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=69.6s)]
*  he was a fierce advocate for the CDC, as am I. The CDC is an agency filled with hardworking, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=75.68s)]
*  dedicated public health servants. They wake up every single day working to keep us safe. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=85.36000000000001s)]
*  I think we don't think often enough about their work because it's easy not to celebrate [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  folks who are protecting you from that which doesn't appear because of the work that they're [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  doing. So grateful for the work that the CDC employees do, some of them are members of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=102.2s)]
*  my church. I saw that deep commitment firsthand when I visited the CDC just last summer. Mr. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=106.92s)]
*  Kennedy, you have compared the CDC's work to NOCSE death camps. You've compared it to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  sexual abusers in the Catholic Church. You've also said that many of them belong, this is [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=123.64s)]
*  a direct quote, many of them belong in jail. For me, those are disturbing characterizations [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=131.32s)]
*  of the CDC workers that I know who are trying to keep the American public safe every single [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=139.4s)]
*  day. And as you are presenting us the nominee for this position, I need to know, do you [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=146.04s)]
*  stand by those statements that you made in the past or do you retract those previous [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=152.28s)]
*  statements? Senator, I don't believe that I ever compared the CDC to NOCSE death camps. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=158.96s)]
*  I support the CDC. My job is not to dismantle or harm the CDC. My job is to empower the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  scientists if I'm privileged to be confirmed. So you retract those statements? I'm not retracting [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=174.24s)]
*  it. I never said it. Well, actually I have a transcript. Of me saying that it's a NOCSE [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=180.24s)]
*  death camp. Let me read your words. It says that the institution, CDC and the vaccine program, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=186.08s)]
*  is your description of their work, is more important than the children that it's supposed [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=192.96s)]
*  to protect. And you know, it's the same reason we had a pedophile scandal in the Catholic Church. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=196.32000000000002s)]
*  It's because people were able to convince themselves that the institution of the church [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  was more important than these little boys and girls who were being raped. That's pretty [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  provocative language. You said in another statement to me, this is like NOCSE death camp. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=212.8s)]
*  Let me finish. I'm just reading your words. I mean, what happens, what happened to these kids? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=221.68s)]
*  One in 31 boys in this country, their minds are being robbed from them. Yeah, I was not [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=226.4s)]
*  comparing the CDC to NOCSE death camps. I was comparing the injury rate to our children to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=235.68s)]
*  other atrocities. And I wouldn't compare the, of course, the CDC to NOCSE death camps to any [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=241.84s)]
*  extent. Any statement that I made has been interpreted that way. Yeah, I don't agree with [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  that. In 2003, the United States Congress, Government Oversight Committee, ended an [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=257.44s)]
*  an over a year investigation of the CDC and used almost that same language. They said that the CDC, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=269.84s)]
*  just one division, one branch, the Immunization Safety Office, had put institutional self-interest [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=277.68s)]
*  and pharmaceutical profits ahead of the welfare and health of American children. So that was a [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=285.44s)]
*  conclusion by Congress. And I repeat that. Well, I'm asking you because you're the nominee for HHS. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=294.0s)]
*  It sounds like you stand by those statements. Senator, my objective is to support the CDC. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=301.44s)]
*  There's nothing I'm going to do that is going to harm CDC. I want to make sure that our science is [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=308.24s)]
*  gold standard science, and it's free from that same Government Oversight Investigation Committee. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=313.04s)]
*  On the panels, the ACIP panel within CDC, I think 97% of the people on it had conflicts. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't believe that that's right. I think we need to end those conflicts and make sure that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=330.0s)]
*  scientists are doing unobstructed science. So I want to enter this statement, by the way, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=334.56s)]
*  into the record without objection. Without objection. Last week, the White House gagged HHS [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=339.68s)]
*  and the CDC, preventing them from communicating all important public health information to anyone, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  including all of our allies, including our allies in the United States in global disease [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=353.44s)]
*  prevention. Can you just answer yes or no, because I'm running out of time? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=358.32s)]
*  Do you agree with that action? I was not consulted on it, but that's pretty much standard operating [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=361.2s)]
*  procedure for incoming administrations. So you agree with the action that gagged HHS and CDC [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=366.32s)]
*  from communicating important public health information? That directive made sure that no [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=374.16s)]
*  public health and only non-essential travel and mass communications were temporarily suspended [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=382.24s)]
*  pending the confirmation of a new HHS secretary. This is standard operating procedure. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=392.64000000000004s)]
*  I get it. I don't think what we've seen over the last several days is standard [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=397.44s)]
*  operation for new administrations. I think we're seeing some unprecedented actions, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=405.68s)]
*  but you agree with it. Last night, members of the CDC, along with other federal employees, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=409.52s)]
*  were actually invited to resign. These buyouts. And I got text messages and folks I know for the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=417.04s)]
*  CDC that do this important work who got that note. And it's really important because my experience [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=425.28s)]
*  is that when you send out that kind of note, the folks who resign are the folks who you least likely [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=431.68s)]
*  want to see resign. They got other options. They're gifted folks. They got a lot of expertise. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  They have options. A lot of them are doing this work because of their patriotism, because of their [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=443.52s)]
*  commitment. Do you agree with the buyouts that were presented to CDC employees just last night? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=448.96s)]
*  I agree. The vast majority of the scientists and experts at CDC are patriots and good government [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=455.35999999999996s)]
*  servants. Can you tell me yes or no? I don't think anybody's going to resign who's committed [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=465.28s)]
*  to making America healthy again. Can you just answer yes? Okay, you agree with the buyouts. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=469.52s)]
*  In our meeting, I asked you to confirm your support for the Affordable Care Act. You also [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=474.32s)]
*  mentioned that you and President Trump want to fix the ACA by making premiums more affordable. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=480.56s)]
*  Can you answer me yes or no? As I don't have a lot of time. Did you know that tax credits [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=487.2s)]
*  that help families afford health insurance and save Georgia's an average of $531 per [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=496.0s)]
*  month per person are set to expire at the end of the year? Did you know that? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=504.0s)]
*  I do. We need to move on. Do you support Congress extending these tax credits [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=507.92s)]
*  so that Americans can continue to afford health care? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=515.44s)]
*  Congress has to make its own decisions about that. My instructions from President Trump- [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=518.96s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, you're saying I'm running out of time, but I'm having a lot of trouble [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=523.2s)]
*  getting the witness to answer yes or no to a yes or no question. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=527.44s)]
*  I've got one more question. You're almost at nine minutes, sir. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, I need him to answer yes or no. Yes or no? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=535.76s)]
*  I'm not going to answer yes or no to a question that's not susceptible to an honest yes or no. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=541.6s)]
*  We need to move on. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=546.72s)]
*  I think that the fact that you find it difficult to answer basic questions is deeply troubling [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=550.08s)]
*  for me as you present yourself as a nominee to run HHS. Thank you so very much. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=556.8s)]
*  I've been in courts all over the country. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=562.96s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, you told me I'm out of time and the witness continues to filibuster even after I said I'm done. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azW9sgETFA&t=566.48s)]
