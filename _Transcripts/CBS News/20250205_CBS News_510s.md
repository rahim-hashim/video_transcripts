# Rep. Chip Roy weighs in on Trump's proposed takeover of Gaza
**CBS News:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg)
*  Allies and adversaries of the United States are widely criticizing President Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=0.0s)]
*  proposal to, quote, take over the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=4.8s)]
*  Republican Congressman Chip Roy joins us now from Capitol Hill. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=8.24s)]
*  He represents Texas in its 21st Congressional District. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Congressman, thanks for being here. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=14.88s)]
*  So you are one of the more prominent conservative voices in the U.S. House. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=16.8s)]
*  What's the reaction not only of yourself but of your colleagues to what the president has [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  proposed? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=24.0s)]
*  Well, we're still listening to the administration and to his team to understand exactly what the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=25.96s)]
*  plan is. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  We're, you know, strongly behind the president and what he's been doing to actually stand [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=31.8s)]
*  alongside Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=35.8s)]
*  I was proud to get the International Criminal Court sanctions bill through the House. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=37.72s)]
*  Unfortunately, the Senate Democrats rejected it, but we're proud to stand alongside the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=44.44s)]
*  prime minister, stand alongside Israel. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=48.28s)]
*  And now the president has plans for what he wants to do with respect to Gaza. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=50.2s)]
*  We'll listen to those. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  We obviously, you know, don't have any real strong interest in having our military men and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=54.52s)]
*  women, you know, overseas in dangerous situations. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  He's the commander in chief, and we'll give him the benefit of the doubt to determine what's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=61.64s)]
*  best for our country. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=64.76s)]
*  And then we'll reserve the right to review it over time. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=65.56s)]
*  But we would make sure that it's in our national security interests and that we're standing [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=68.44s)]
*  alongside our friend Israel. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=72.76s)]
*  Is it on the table that you'd be open to considering having U.S. troops serve in Gaza? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=75.16s)]
*  Well, the commander in chief can move men and women in uniform around for national security [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=80.12s)]
*  interests. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=86.84s)]
*  But obviously, if there's anything that's going to be long term, you got to come to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=87.16000000000001s)]
*  Congress and figure out what what we're going to do that's in our national security interest. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=89.88000000000001s)]
*  You know, I'm not one for the president campaigned against having foreign entanglements abroad. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=94.44s)]
*  I trust the president to make good judgment here. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=99.72s)]
*  And again, he's doing what the Biden administration would not do, which is stand directly [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  alongside Prime Minister Netanyahu, stand alongside Israel, stand up against the International [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=107.96s)]
*  Criminal Court. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=112.91999999999999s)]
*  Democrats are blocking that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=113.88s)]
*  Chuck Schumer led an effort to block that rather than standing up against their ridiculous, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=115.63999999999999s)]
*  lawless pursuit of Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=120.36s)]
*  So I trust President Trump to get this right. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=122.91999999999999s)]
*  And we'll we'll listen more to their administration about what their plans are. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=125.08s)]
*  Congressman, you've been in politics for a long time. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=129.4s)]
*  You've been a chief of staff as well as a lawmaker. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=132.44s)]
*  You've been close to some of the top republics in the country for over a decade. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=135.24s)]
*  Step back for a second and you look at what President Trump said here. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  Is this similar to what he said, for example, on tariffs, where he takes a maximalist position [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=141.88s)]
*  as a way of maybe getting some leverage in a negotiation? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=146.76s)]
*  Is this about nudging Israel along on a certain path, nudging the Arab nations along to maybe [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=150.12s)]
*  accept some people who have been living in Gaza? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=155.96s)]
*  What do you see as the actual big picture here beyond the explicit proposal he made? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=159.72s)]
*  Well, first of all, what you've seen over the last now two weeks and change out of the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  president has been shaking the world because they're actually now seeing leadership again. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=170.6s)]
*  We're seeing what that means in Mexico, having 10,000 Mexican military members up along their [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=174.44s)]
*  northern border, our southern border. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=180.2s)]
*  You've seen what that's meant with Colombia, with Venezuela, and now around the world. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=181.64s)]
*  And now he's engaging here. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=185.4s)]
*  And I think it's I do think it's purposeful. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=186.6s)]
*  He always has a plan. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=188.68s)]
*  But again, he took Prime Minister Netanyahu in and had him as one of his first visits in the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=190.28s)]
*  White House, if not his first visit with the head of state. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=196.11999999999998s)]
*  And so he's making a loud signal to the world after the Abraham Accords, the historic Abraham [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=198.76s)]
*  Accords, that we would have an engagement with Israel to try to continue to grow and develop [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=204.04s)]
*  the Middle East relationships. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=208.83999999999997s)]
*  Imagine where things would be if we hadn't had the intervening four years where Joe Biden [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  abandoned Prime Minister Netanyahu in Israel. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=214.67999999999998s)]
*  We would have built on the Abraham Accords and built on the relationships, having flights [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=217.08s)]
*  from countries all over the Middle East into Israel and having engagement economically [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=221.56s)]
*  through commerce. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=226.52s)]
*  So I think this is all a part of his plan to try to engage. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=227.32000000000002s)]
*  And again, he'll come present to us what he has in store. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=230.12s)]
*  But he's two weeks in. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=233.4s)]
*  Let's give him some room to go do his job as president. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=234.36s)]
*  Congressman, let's turn to taxes. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  You told reporters today House Republicans are considering, as we've heard for a long time, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=239.24s)]
*  extending the Trump tax cuts for five years, though, instead of 10. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=243.48000000000002s)]
*  What other details can you share about the proposal you're working on? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=247.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean, last year, President Trump was very clear. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=253.56s)]
*  He campaigned against inflation in his inaugural speech in the Dome Room right behind me. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=256.12s)]
*  He mentioned it again that we need to combat inflation by cutting spending. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=261.32s)]
*  That's our goal. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=264.52000000000004s)]
*  Here's to cut spending. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=265.24s)]
*  Scott Besson, his secretary of treasury, has a 333 plan. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=266.6s)]
*  The last three of that is to reduce deficits to 3% of GDP. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=270.12s)]
*  I think I agree with the secretary. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=274.36s)]
*  I agree with the president. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=276.2s)]
*  And that's what we're standing on. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=277.47999999999996s)]
*  We need spending cuts. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=278.68s)]
*  All we're really asking for is the $250 billion a year out of $7 trillion [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=279.96s)]
*  that we agreed to as a Republican conference over Christmas. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=285.4s)]
*  We think we ought to restore basically the Trump budget from before COVID in 2025. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=288.84s)]
*  They would have spent $6 trillion. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=293.88s)]
*  We're now at $7 trillion. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=295.24s)]
*  The American people are tired of it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=296.59999999999997s)]
*  They're tired of inflation. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=297.8s)]
*  So we want to have cuts. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=299.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=300.28s)]
*  And so the five-year, 10-year debate about taxes, I want to make tax cuts permanent. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=300.84s)]
*  I want to have more money in the hands of the American people. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=304.92s)]
*  But we have to do math up here. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=307.40000000000003s)]
*  And my Republican colleagues need to step to the plate, deliver on the spending restraint, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=309.24s)]
*  create savings, drop down the amount of debt that we're growing so our bond markets stabilize, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=314.84000000000003s)]
*  interest rates can go down, Americans can afford houses, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=319.72s)]
*  and we can actually do our job to get deficits under control. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=323.88s)]
*  That's what we're trying to put forward. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=327.0s)]
*  And so let's look ahead for a second. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  Congressman Roy, March 15th, you got the debt limit showdown. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=330.68s)]
*  You got the budget and the government funding expiring. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=333.88s)]
*  We know that House conservatives for a long time now always want concessions on spending. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=337.48s)]
*  But what's actually possible here? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=342.84s)]
*  President Trump's driving the discussion more than anyone. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=344.36s)]
*  What can you exact out of him? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=347.64s)]
*  Well, our job is to work with the president to achieve his objective and our objective, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=352.52s)]
*  which is to reduce deficits and create economic growth. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=356.36s)]
*  And so what we're doing is just saying in the budget committee and here in the House [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=359.56s)]
*  that we need to deliver on the spending cuts we all promised. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=363.4s)]
*  We're not asking for anything more than that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=366.44s)]
*  If we do that, if we simply deliver on the $250 billion in cuts, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=368.44s)]
*  that would unlock having permanent 10-year plus tax relief, unlock economic growth, and deliver. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=372.59999999999997s)]
*  And by the way, we can do this part by providing some funding for defense and border. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=378.2s)]
*  And then in March, we can hold appropriations flat. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=382.76s)]
*  We can just say, look, we're going to do a continuing resolution through the end of the year, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  pass spending flat for the next year, hold that in check, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=389.23999999999995s)]
*  save another $200 billion, and then we're actually really cooking with peanut oil. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=392.36s)]
*  And that's what I think the American people sent us here to do. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=396.36s)]
*  So we'll be working with the president to do that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=398.84000000000003s)]
*  And finally, immigration. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=401.96000000000004s)]
*  Texas Governor Greg Abbott met with the president at the White House today [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=403.72s)]
*  to discuss the border, including his $11 billion reimbursement request for border security. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=407.16s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=412.12s)]
*  This is in a way a real estate transaction because Texas can transfer to the United States of [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=414.68s)]
*  America value of well over $5 or $6 billion of real assets on the ground that Texas put in place [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=420.04s)]
*  that will continue to secure the United States for decades to come. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=427.72s)]
*  Governor Abbott said he will be back in Washington next week to discuss this with lawmakers. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=432.92s)]
*  Where do you stand, Congressman, on this issue? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=437.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, well, first of all, the governor's done a great job in trying to fill the void left [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=442.04s)]
*  by President Biden when they left our borders exposed to cartels and lawlessness, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=445.56s)]
*  endangering Texans who've died from fentanyl poisoning and have had dangerous gangs from [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=449.16s)]
*  Venezuela and elsewhere on our streets, resulting in the deaths of our people. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=453.0s)]
*  Governor Abbott deserves credit for that. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=456.84000000000003s)]
*  DPS agents that stood in the breach. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=458.28000000000003s)]
*  And now they want to get paid back. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=460.52000000000004s)]
*  The governor's correct. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=462.04s)]
*  We Texans want to be paid back. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=463.0s)]
*  I'm leading a letter among my Texas delegation. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=464.52000000000004s)]
*  I think we'll get all of us on it, along with my friends in the Senate, Senators Cornyn and Cruz, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=466.52000000000004s)]
*  for the $11.1 billion over and above our normal expenditures that Texas has spent [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=471.16s)]
*  to do the job the federal government refused to do. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=476.36s)]
*  So working with Governor Abbott, proud to do it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=478.52s)]
*  We need to be paid back. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=481.15999999999997s)]
*  There are some of those assets that I think we could hand over to the administration. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=482.35999999999996s)]
*  But $11 billion. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=487.0s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=488.44s)]
*  That's a lot of money, even in Texas. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=489.08s)]
*  We're the eighth biggest economy in the world. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=490.52s)]
*  That's $11 billion, not in our schools. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=492.2s)]
*  $11 billion, not on our highways protecting our people. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=494.2s)]
*  $11 billion that's not out there in property tax relief for Texans. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=497.24s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=501.15999999999997s)]
*  Because the federal government failed to do their job. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=501.56s)]
*  So Governor Abbott's right. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=503.47999999999996s)]
*  We need to deliver for Texans. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=504.59999999999997s)]
*  Congressman Chip Roy, thank you. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=506.84s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw9e51LYlg&t=509.0s)]
