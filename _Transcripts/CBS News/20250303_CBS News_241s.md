# House Democrats launch investigation into NYC Mayor Eric Adams' dealings with DOJ
**CBS News:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s)
*  Two Congress members now say they are launching an investigation into the Justice Department's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=0.0s)]
*  move to clear New York City Mayor Eric Adams from corruption charges. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=5.2s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News Department of Justice reporter Jake Rosen. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=8.92s)]
*  Jake, thank you for joining us today. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=12.64s)]
*  We know two Democrat lawmakers, they sent that letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=14.68s)]
*  And the big question is, what was in that letter? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=19.8s)]
*  What was it about? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Jamie Raskin, who is the ranking chair, so he is not in charge of the committee because [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=26.84s)]
*  Democrats do not have control of the House of Representatives. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=31.02s)]
*  He and Jasmine Crockett, who oversees the Oversight Committee, two very important Democrats [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=33.88s)]
*  for what they can do to investigate Donald Trump. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=38.84s)]
*  They're asking for documents in conversations between Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  of Justice officials and people at the White House, asking for specifics of what exactly [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=45.92s)]
*  happened in the leading up to the move to drop the charges against New York City Mayor [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=50.0s)]
*  Eric Adams. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=54.6s)]
*  We are expecting that there really would not be a lot of cooperation from the White House [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=55.94s)]
*  and the Department of Justice on this. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=60.62s)]
*  We'll have to see exactly how this plays out. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=62.059999999999995s)]
*  But they're asking for exactly what happened in terms of whether they moved to drop the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=64.3s)]
*  charges after Adams agreed to cooperate or really trying to back up that conversation [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=68.38s)]
*  about a potential quid pro quo that Democrats have been alleging for the last couple of [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=72.44s)]
*  weeks. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=76.3s)]
*  Jake, I want to ask you about something else here because around 1500 Trump supporters [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=77.3s)]
*  were pardoned on charges related to the attack on the Capitol on January 6th, but there is [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=81.94s)]
*  a case out there that is still it's still active. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=86.74000000000001s)]
*  It involves a Texas woman. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=90.18s)]
*  Her name is Abigail Shry. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=91.66000000000001s)]
*  What are the charges that she's facing? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=93.58000000000001s)]
*  Well that's right. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=96.7s)]
*  Donald Trump has not faced legal charges because his his case was dropped. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=97.7s)]
*  About 1600 people's cases were pardoned after Donald Trump pardoned a lot of the January [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=102.34s)]
*  6th defendants on his first day in office. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=107.74000000000001s)]
*  This woman, Abigail Jo Shry from Texas, is the only case that currently exists right [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=111.32s)]
*  now stemming from the January 6th riot at the Capitol and investigations that followed [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  up. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  She threatened Judge Tanya Chutkin, who was the judge who oversaw the Donald Trump's [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  short-lived case here in Washington, D.C. as a result of the January 6th attack. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=125.6s)]
*  She issued vile and racist threats against the judge and she has been charged by the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=130.12s)]
*  Department of Justice and so far Donald Trump's pardon of January 6th defendants has not applied [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  to that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=139.72s)]
*  The Department of Justice has not stepped in and said whether or not she's going to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=140.8s)]
*  be officially sentenced, which will come in a couple of months. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=144.24s)]
*  But it's just an interesting case example where really the only threat left out there [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=147.56s)]
*  after all this is a threat to a judge. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=151.56s)]
*  As we've seen, as a result of all these legal actions, threats against Congress members [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=153.76s)]
*  and judges have really been on the climb the last couple of weeks. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=157.88s)]
*  So it's certainly something that we'll have to keep tabs on going forward. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=160.36s)]
*  Yeah, and we know you'll do that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=163.28s)]
*  A judge in Washington over the weekend sided with the head of a federal watchdog agency [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  ruling that he must remain in his job. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=170.2s)]
*  Do you know about the details on this one? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and we've covered this for the last couple of weeks as it's kind of ping-ponged [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=175.28s)]
*  between the district court here in Washington and the Supreme Court. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=179.76s)]
*  Hampton Dellinger, who oversees government ethics complaints and watchdog, he basically [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=182.83999999999997s)]
*  is a government watchdog between the executive branch and Congress, he was fired by Donald [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=187.76s)]
*  Trump and his attorneys have argued in court that the firing was illegal and that the Trump [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  administration had no authority to fire Dellinger and his job as special counsel, which [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=196.0s)]
*  they said is a completely independent agency. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=200.08s)]
*  A federal judge here sided officially after temporarily putting him back in his job, gave [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=202.84s)]
*  him more permanent status and going back into his job. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=207.56s)]
*  He sided actually against the Trump administration in a lot of these cases where they, workers [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=210.76000000000002s)]
*  who've been fired by the Trump administration have sued to get their jobs back. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=214.84s)]
*  He sided with them in that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=218.56s)]
*  This case goes back up to the Supreme Court after the Supreme Court technically and temporarily [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=220.0s)]
*  allowed him to stay in his job last week. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=224.52s)]
*  We'll see what the Supreme Court rules whenever they decide to take this case up, but it's [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=227.16s)]
*  again another high profile example of Trump using his executive power and people assuming [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=230.24s)]
*  to either slow him down or get their jobs back. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=234.8s)]
*  Okay, CBS News Department of Justice reporter Jake Rosen, thank you. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_DMUo_Q9s&t=237.2s)]
