# Trump to announce retaliatory tariffs
**CBS News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ)
*  Meanwhile, the White House gearing up for several major announcements today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump says he will sign blanket reciprocal tariffs. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=4.36s)]
*  He also plans to sign at least one executive order in the Oval Office. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=7.96s)]
*  Just moments ago, Press Secretary Caroline Levitt had this to say about those tariffs [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  during a quick briefing with reporters. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=18.28s)]
*  He's very excited about this reciprocal tariff announcement. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=19.28s)]
*  His team has been working on it for quite some time. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  You saw him truth about it bright and early this morning, so he looks forward to seeing [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=25.28s)]
*  all of you in the Oval at one o'clock. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=28.24s)]
*  We will see you then and then we're going to swear in R.F.K. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=30.24s)]
*  Jr., who I understand is going to... [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=32.239999999999995s)]
*  All right, so let's go to CBS News White House reporter Aaron Navarro. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  He joins us live. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=37.68s)]
*  Aaron, good to be with you. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=38.68s)]
*  We just heard Caroline Levitt say the president and his team have been working on these tariffs [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=40.12s)]
*  for some time. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=44.68s)]
*  Do we have any details about what this new round might include? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=45.68s)]
*  This was a core campaign promise for President Trump just last year. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=51.58s)]
*  What we know is that these reciprocal tariffs will be blanket tariffs matching those levied [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=55.96s)]
*  against the United States by other countries. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=59.84s)]
*  Trump has argued that this will help grow jobs here in the U.S., will help reduce the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=63.18s)]
*  trade deficit that the U.S. has with other countries, but it could really impact more [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=67.48s)]
*  developing countries, including India, Brazil, among them given the disparity in their tariff [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=71.82000000000001s)]
*  rates. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=76.84s)]
*  Economists have said that the impact of these reciprocal tariffs could trickle down to the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=77.84s)]
*  American consumer when it comes to prices for groceries, vehicles, things of that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=82.86s)]
*  And Aaron, we know that today Trump is going to sit down with the prime minister of India, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=87.61999999999999s)]
*  Prime Minister Modi, and he's dubbed India the tariff king. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=91.78s)]
*  Now these two men have had a warm relationship, at least during his first term, so what more [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=96.74s)]
*  can you tell us about the meeting today? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=101.17999999999999s)]
*  Right, and the prime minister just met with Vice President Vance earlier this week. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=103.02s)]
*  We know from what White House officials have said about the meeting is that they will focus [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=110.18s)]
*  on trade, energy, infrastructure, and especially on defense. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=114.06s)]
*  The White House will aim to build on defense sales to India. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  They will discuss bringing down the trade deficit between the two countries, but all [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=120.86000000000001s)]
*  of this is kind of meant to help make sure that India remains a crucial partner in that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=124.62s)]
*  Indo-Pacific region, especially with China as a big adversary to the U.S. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=129.18s)]
*  And Aaron, you have some new reporting on the mass firing of federal probationary employees. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=133.66s)]
*  That began last night. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=138.82s)]
*  What did you learn? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=140.7s)]
*  We have heard from sources at the Department of Education that there were, quote, department-wide [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=141.7s)]
*  terminations of probationary employees. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=148.3s)]
*  These are employees that came in maybe in the past year or so, and they were informed [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=150.74s)]
*  by email last night. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=154.7s)]
*  And this comes, you know, just a couple days after Trump said he wants to shut down that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=156.02s)]
*  agency comes, of course, as the DOJ agency has been looking to shrink the federal workforce. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=160.22s)]
*  We also know, per a spokesperson with the American Federation of Government Employees, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=167.26s)]
*  that probationary employees and the Small Business Administration have also been terminated [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=171.84s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=177.06s)]
*  And this, all of this comes just a couple days after Trump signed an executive order [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=178.06s)]
*  that kind of emboldens DOJ to make what was written as, quote, large-scale reductions [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=182.45999999999998s)]
*  in force. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=188.45999999999998s)]
*  So these employees are finding out that they've been fired just through an email, right? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=189.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=193.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, through a letter sent by email. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=194.66s)]
*  And from talking to some this morning, some have not been able to access their work email [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=196.78s)]
*  because they're terminated. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=201.78s)]
*  So they can't see the legal letter, but they have heard from some of their bosses that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=202.9s)]
*  they are terminated. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=207.38s)]
*  So it's an interesting situation, to say the least. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=208.38s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=210.66s)]
*  Aaron Navarro, thank you so much for that reporting. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpaOrr5tXSQ&t=211.66s)]
