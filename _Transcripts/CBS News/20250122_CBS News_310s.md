# Lawmakers concerned over Jan. 6 case retaliation
**CBS News:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU)
*  But first, following all of this from the Capitol is CBS News congressional correspondent Scott McFarlane. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=0.0s)]
*  He joins us now. Scott, thank you for being with us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=5.0s)]
*  What more can you tell us about the people expected to be released today, already released today, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=7.5s)]
*  and more reaction from lawmakers on the Hill? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=12.0s)]
*  There are roughly 200, 250 of the 1,600 January 6th defendants who were incarcerated when these pardons came down. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=17.0s)]
*  A small minority, those who had the most violent offenses, the most serious felonies, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=27.0s)]
*  and a few dozen who had yet to go to trial but were deemed so dangerous they couldn't be released. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=33.0s)]
*  So the prison release has really just composed a small percentage of the overall clemency and overall pardons. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=38.0s)]
*  But the prison gates have opened since Monday night, and they'll remain open for the defendants to walk out today. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=46.0s)]
*  We expect the remaining incarcerated pretrial and post-trial felony defendants to be released before the day is over. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=52.0s)]
*  But there is a broader concern that is emerging here at the Capitol today. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=60.0s)]
*  Concerns about retaliation against those who were part of the cases that locked these January 6th defendants up. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=66.0s)]
*  Talked to a number of police officers who were witnesses at the trials or spoke at sentencing [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=73.0s)]
*  who believed they are about to be threatened, harassed, and menaced. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=80.0s)]
*  One of those officers, former D.C. police officer Michael Fanone, told CBS News he is now seeking five protective orders [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=84.0s)]
*  against Capitol rioters, including one of the ones Congressman Aguilar just mentioned, the attackers who assaulted him. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=92.0s)]
*  Sergeant Acalino Gonel, a retired sergeant with the Capitol police who stood down from his job because of injury sustained that day, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=101.0s)]
*  has received messages from the Department of Justice warning him that defendants he testified against are being released. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=108.0s)]
*  That is a custom in the Defense Department to warn witnesses who have testified against defendants who are poised to be released. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=115.0s)]
*  He's playing message after message after message because he testified so frequently. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=121.0s)]
*  Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who represents a lot of the Capitol complex employees, a lot of folks here who live in Maryland, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=126.0s)]
*  said he is worried about his constituents being subjected to retaliation by the newly released, newly pardoned, violent offenders from January 6. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=132.0s)]
*  And just to remind our viewers that these people were, you know, charged with many of them, seditious conspiracy and assaulting police officers. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=141.0s)]
*  But I want to turn to some other news there, Scott. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=148.0s)]
*  Confirmation hearings for President Trump's picks to lead the nation's top posts. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=151.0s)]
*  The Senate Budget Committee just held a hearing on Russell Vote that wrapped up just moments ago. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=155.0s)]
*  Vote is tapped to lead the Office of Management and Budget. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=159.0s)]
*  Can you walk us through what happened in his hearing? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=162.0s)]
*  Yeah, pretty important hearing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=166.0s)]
*  And let me tell you, the Senate Budget Committee doesn't deal with the sexiest of material in general. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=167.0s)]
*  So these confirmation hearings are a rare opportunity for cameras to enter the Senate Budget Committee hearing room. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=172.0s)]
*  The Russell vote was a key player in the first Trump administration, and Democrats have alleged his fingerprints are all over that Project 2025. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=178.0s)]
*  And he was an architect of that controversial plan that was such a wedge issue during the campaign to overhaul so many federal agencies, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=186.0s)]
*  to shrink so many federal agencies that deliver services to constituents. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=193.0s)]
*  Russell Vote's facing questions about his work with Project 2025, his work in the first Trump administration. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=198.0s)]
*  He's a well-known figure here in Washington. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=205.0s)]
*  He is viewed as a ardent Trump loyalist who will do the president's bidding on spending and government agencies. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=207.0s)]
*  The fundamental bottom line here, though, Liz, there have been no Republican defections that have declaratively said, I'm not going to support Russell Vote. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=214.0s)]
*  Until that happens, all these nominees are on a fast track to confirmation. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=220.0s)]
*  I want to move now to maybe a higher profile pick here, a new allegation surrounding Pete Hegseth. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=224.0s)]
*  Remember, he's the man to lead up the Defense Department. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=230.0s)]
*  Can you walk us through these new allegations from his former sister-in-law? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=232.0s)]
*  We're talking allegations of alcohol abuse and his former wife fearing for her safety. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=236.0s)]
*  Hegseth looked pretty confident after his Senate hearings last week. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=242.0s)]
*  How is this going to impact the votes he needs to get through? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=246.0s)]
*  There's no indication yet as the afternoon begins here in Washington that there's any impact on the politics here at all. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=250.0s)]
*  The revelations come from paperwork that surfaced yesterday, Hegseth's sister-in-law that alleged that he was deemed a danger to a previous wife. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=259.0s)]
*  And there are some granular anecdotes included in that deposition or affidavit. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=268.0s)]
*  Hegseth, through his attorney, has unambiguously denied those accusations. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=272.0s)]
*  He was approved Monday through the Senate Armed Services Committee by a party line, very narrow vote. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=276.0s)]
*  But he remains on a course towards Senate approval until a Senate Republican steps out and says, I have concerns about Pete Hegseth. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=282.0s)]
*  And that has not happened this week. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=290.0s)]
*  And as more time goes by between those new accusations and a confirmation vote, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=292.0s)]
*  he too appears to be on a fast track to confirmation to lead arguably the most complex bureaucracy in the world. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=298.0s)]
*  CBS News congressional correspondent Scott McFarland, thanks so much as always. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fMj5S99kU&t=305.0s)]
