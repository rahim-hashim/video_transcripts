# Trump knocks Time Magazine after it puts Musk on cover
**CBS News:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48)
*  We have just a few final details that are now, and it's going very well. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm very excited about where we are and the fact that we're going to be moving this forward. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=4.8s)]
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=10.8s)]
*  That was the familiar face and voice of House Speaker Mike Johnson walking through hallways [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=11.8s)]
*  on Capitol Hill, it's a pretty frequent occurrence, discussing the emerging, potentially, or maybe [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=15.84s)]
*  not framework for a Trump-backed budget and tax bill. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=21.04s)]
*  Now, the Senate, Republicans, well they're moving forward with a plan of their own. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=26.200000000000003s)]
*  Will these be at cross purposes or ultimately unified? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  Well, that's what we're going to talk about, among other things. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=33.68s)]
*  Political reporters for, well, one political reporter from Notas, Jasmine Wright, and Daniela [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=36.52s)]
*  Diaz in a blessed sort of professional limbo, soon to be at Notas. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  Woohoo! [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  Join me now. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  Okay, before we get to the budget things, I want to show you this animation we have [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  of two Time Magazine covers. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=54.28s)]
*  One from Trump 1.0, Steve Bannon. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=56.84s)]
*  Then Chief Strategist, show us that big, glowering face of Steve Bannon. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=59.68s)]
*  And then now, this week. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=66.14s)]
*  Roll it, control room, there it is, dissolving two, Elon Musk behind the resolute desk. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  Our Ouija Jang asked the President of the United States about that today. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=75.12s)]
*  Is Time Magazine still in business? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=80.68s)]
*  I didn't even know that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=82.48s)]
*  Is Time Magazine still in business? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=83.48s)]
*  Elon is doing a great job. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=86.48s)]
*  He's finding tremendous fraud and corruption and waste. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=90.08s)]
*  You see it with the USAID. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  If you go to Trump Tower, you'll see framed Time Magazine covers of Donald Trump. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=97.0s)]
*  Many, many, many of them. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=103.36s)]
*  Some of them real, some of them not real. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  He gave Time Magazine a huge interview last fall. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=106.84s)]
*  Yeah, he was Time Person of the Year. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=110.0s)]
*  He knows it's still in business and he cares. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=112.52s)]
*  The only reason we are having some fun with this is that there is only one majordomo in [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=115.8s)]
*  the Trump White House and it's President Trump. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=124.24s)]
*  And anyone who finds themselves intentionally or unintentionally sitting in that position [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=126.12s)]
*  or portrayed to be sitting in that position or being portrayed as having the ultimate [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=132.12s)]
*  authority finds that person finds themselves at cross purposes and in the crosshairs of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=136.24s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=142.56s)]
*  This could be a dynamic for the Elon Musk relationship. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=143.84s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=146.36s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=147.36s)]
*  I mean, I think it's fascinating because just about every single time that Trump is talking [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=148.36s)]
*  to reporters, he's getting at least one question about Elon Musk. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=152.0s)]
*  About what he's done, whether he approves it, how much rope does Elon have, who is doing [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  it? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=162.0s)]
*  Is he acting on his instructions or is he acting on his own instructions? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=163.88s)]
*  Kind of constant questions, not just to him, but also to Caroline Levin, to other officials [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=166.48s)]
*  within the government. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=170.76s)]
*  So they know that reporters are interested in trying to see whether or not there is daylight [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=171.76s)]
*  in between these two really kind of massive ego men. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=176.36s)]
*  Trump continues to say that things are okay, that he likes what Elon is doing, that Elon [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=181.0s)]
*  is going to do only what Trump allows him to do. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=185.56s)]
*  And certainly as one person close to Trump told me that they feel like it might still [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=189.27999999999997s)]
*  be kind of a ticking time bomb, even though people within the White House say when you [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=194.1s)]
*  ask them that they like Elon and they like what he's doing. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=198.98s)]
*  And Daniella, the president was asked today, will Elon show up at a podium and take questions? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=201.29999999999998s)]
*  Trump's like, oh, sure. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=205.17999999999998s)]
*  I can't wait for that, president. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=206.66s)]
*  I mean, it's obvious that he's become not only the figurehead of the Trump administration, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=208.26s)]
*  but also a Democratic boogeyman. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=213.14s)]
*  He's become someone that we're seeing Democrats on Capitol Hill. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=215.26s)]
*  What I cover and where I go every day, the target of their attention. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=218.42s)]
*  It's a really easy way for Democrats to be able to rally their voters ahead. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=222.29999999999998s)]
*  We don't talk about midterms yet, but it's it's figurative that that Elon Musk is one [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=227.26s)]
*  of the people in this administration that we're seeing every single day on X posting [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=231.98s)]
*  against these federal agencies that he's trying to gut. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=237.66s)]
*  We're seeing Doge working. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=241.11999999999998s)]
*  We're seeing Republicans speak about him and praise him and Democrats attack him. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=242.77999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's it's the new boogeyman that we're seeing in this administration. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=246.74s)]
*  You know, last administration, Steve Bannon, this administration, Elon Musk. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=250.22s)]
*  And there's a great question. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=254.38s)]
*  And it's a very serious question about why the associates of Elon Musk are basically [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=255.58s)]
*  plugging in to this federal infrastructure and what they're doing now that they're plugged [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=261.06s)]
*  in. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=266.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, they have eyes on. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=267.90000000000003s)]
*  Treasure troves of highly personal data on tens of millions of Americans. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=271.1s)]
*  And for what purpose? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=274.86s)]
*  President was asked about that today. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=275.98s)]
*  He was kind of, well, they don't really need all that access, but they have it anyway. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=277.18s)]
*  Yeah, I think that that's going to play really well in court when multiple, multiple people [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=280.54s)]
*  continue bringing these court cases questioning why they have so much access and does it violate [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=284.78000000000003s)]
*  clearance laws and all these types of things? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=289.94s)]
*  I was talking to one person. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=292.06s)]
*  Does it conform to ethics rules? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=293.06s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=294.06s)]
*  Are there conflicts of interest? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=295.06s)]
*  Elon Musk has. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=296.06s)]
*  They said earlier, they said earlier this week that Elon Musk would look at his, that [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=297.06s)]
*  Elon Musk would be the one to decide whether or not there is a conflict of interest with [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=301.22s)]
*  all the things that he owns. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=305.36s)]
*  I was talking to one person at an agency for the federal government and they're pretty [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  high up. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=311.0s)]
*  And I asked, do you know what they're doing with the information that they have now been [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=312.0s)]
*  able to gleam from your agency? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=316.04s)]
*  And they flat out said no. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=317.92s)]
*  And so I think that there's questions about transparency, questions about the need for [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=318.92s)]
*  them to have such access and really questions about what they are doing and what it's going [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  to impact. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=327.36s)]
*  But the fact is, is that they're doing things so quickly, people believe that it's going [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=328.36s)]
*  reporters to catch up, but certainly the courts and Democrats. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=332.64s)]
*  Nobody knows and it's not clear how anyone is going to get to know. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=335.36s)]
*  Danielle, I want to ask you about the conversations because I promised the audience this about [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=338.36s)]
*  the budget, the tax bill, Senate Republicans, House Republicans. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=343.4s)]
*  What's your sense? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=347.15999999999997s)]
*  This is the biggest thing on Capitol Hill right now. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=348.68s)]
*  It's become the biggest thing since Republicans got the trifecta, White House, House Senate. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=350.53999999999996s)]
*  And there's a clear disagreement taking place in real time between Senate Republicans and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=355.96s)]
*  House Republicans. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=360.32s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson wants one big, beautiful bill because Donald Trump wants one big, beautiful [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=362.0s)]
*  bill. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  Senate Republicans led by Senator Lindsey Graham, the budget committee chairman, thinks [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=367.71999999999997s)]
*  that they need to have a quick win and has already moved forward on a budget resolution [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=371.59999999999997s)]
*  that- [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  A smaller bill focused on border and other related matters. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  No tax policies specifically in it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=378.8s)]
*  To pay for this would be offset by a separate bill to pass through the process of budget [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=381.6s)]
*  reconciliation, which means they only need a simple majority. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=385.84s)]
*  They don't need Democrats. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=388.0s)]
*  Just 50 votes in the Senate, right? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=389.0s)]
*  But there's obviously real issues because in the House, which Caitlin obviously put [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=390.56s)]
*  very succinctly earlier on the show, they cannot afford to lose any votes and House [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=395.92s)]
*  Freedom Caucus members want to cut spending and they will not support legislation that [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=402.58s)]
*  won't do that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=408.64s)]
*  And Speaker Mike Johnson is going to have to raise the debt limit and acknowledge that [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=409.64s)]
*  today because that is a major priority for Donald Trump. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=413.52s)]
*  So with all these different parts that are playing in real time, Johnson is trying to [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=415.96s)]
*  keep all of his conference together. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=419.96s)]
*  Senate Republicans are saying, hey, we're going to move forward. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=422.28s)]
*  We're not waiting for you. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  So they're going to work through the weekend to figure it out. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=425.15999999999997s)]
*  And Jasmine, for those in the audience, you're like, oh my gosh, it all sounds like a bunch [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=427.2s)]
*  of Washington gobbledygooks. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=429.6s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=430.6s)]
*  I can't sort all this stuff out. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=431.6s)]
*  If you are interested, ladies and gentlemen, in whether or not there'll be taxes on tips, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=433.32s)]
*  taxes on overtime, taxes on Social Security benefits maybe for your parents or someone [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=438.28s)]
*  you know, this is going to be decided here. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=442.28s)]
*  Whether it's in or out, how it gets happened. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=445.86s)]
*  That's where this matters. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=447.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  That's where this matters. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=450.56s)]
*  And that's the fundamental place that Republicans want Donald Trump to kind of make some decisions [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=451.56s)]
*  for them. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=455.40000000000003s)]
*  And he really at this point hasn't. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=456.40000000000003s)]
*  He's told them basically yesterday in that meeting, you guys decide on your own. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=458.08000000000004s)]
*  Four hours at the White House. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=462.0s)]
*  Four hours. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=463.0s)]
*  But he said, you guys, he walked in and said, you guys decide on your own and then come [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=464.0s)]
*  back to me when you have an answer. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=466.94000000000005s)]
*  They didn't have an answer by the time that they left. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=468.88000000000005s)]
*  And so I think that they're really wanting Donald Trump to decide whether or not it's [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=470.90000000000003s)]
*  going to be one or two bills, what they want in the first bill if it's going to be two [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=474.12s)]
*  bills, what can be in the second bill. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=477.44000000000005s)]
*  But he's really saying you guys decide. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=479.26s)]
*  So it's kind of a case of pass the hot potato in the former Republicans, both at the White [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=480.82s)]
*  House and in Congress, when it comes to the next steps going forward. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=485.02s)]
*  But they're going to have to make some decisions and make them very quickly because we know [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=488.48s)]
*  that government funding is going to run out in March. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=491.72s)]
*  And real quick, not only that, Senate Republicans are going to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=494.46000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=497.38s)]
*  So dinner tonight, dinner tonight and a lot of things are going to happen during that [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=498.38s)]
*  conversation. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=502.62s)]
*  Remember, remember, in Washington, if you're not at the table, you're on the menu. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=503.62s)]
*  Jasmine Wright, Daniela Diaz. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=506.26s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=508.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsCbV2Dc48&t=509.58s)]
