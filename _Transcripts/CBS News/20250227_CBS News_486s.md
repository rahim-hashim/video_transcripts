*  Is enduring that it lasts that it's a deal that goes down as a historic deal that nobody breaches [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=8.8s)]
*  Welcome back. Thanks for staying with us [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=16.36s)]
*  That was British Prime Minister Keir Starmer inside the Oval Office as you could notice this afternoon with President Trump Dasha Burns [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Finn Gomez join me now Dasha is the newly minted Politico White House bureau chief [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Talk about newly minted Finn is our executive director of White House and politics [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=29.76s)]
*  Coverage it's great to have you both with us [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=36.040000000000006s)]
*  I want to play you something that also happened in that Oval Office meeting between the British Prime Minister and the American President [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  when a reporter asked [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=46.28s)]
*  President Trump if he still considers [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=48.44s)]
*  Ukrainian president Zelensky a dictator control room, please roll that [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  The next step we're making is toward a very achievable ceasefire. We hope that that can happen quickly because [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  Thousands of young people this case did we're not talking about Americans. We're talking about Ukrainians and Russians are being killed every week. I [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=65.8s)]
*  Said please that's not the one [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=75.32s)]
*  Let's try the one if we have it can we have it we try that again, I'll say please three times, please please [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=77.8s)]
*  Please not there. All right [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  We will get there. Well, yes, I think I have a very good relationship with President Zelensky [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  Did I say that I can't believe I said that next question, yeah next question did I say that okay [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=98.28s)]
*  So that's worth waiting for folks because it is [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=105.52s)]
*  Emblematic of a Trumpian technique say something harsh [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=110.83999999999999s)]
*  Pretend you never said it because you're in the process of trying to soften somebody up or get something else that no one else can quite [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  See it might have all been about negotiations over this mineral access to you [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  We don't know but it's all been withdrawn. Everything's fine and we move on that's kind of a pattern Dasha [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  You're talking your thought and I were here ready to basically do it an SNL style [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=129.56s)]
*  Play of that for you [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=133.48s)]
*  Look when I talk to White House officials, they oftentimes say art of the deal art of the deal [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=136.56s)]
*  You hear that a lot in the in the press area from staff because they'll point to things like calling Zelensky a dictator [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=142.92s)]
*  they'll point to Trump talking about the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=149.72s)]
*  Riviera of the Middle East not to take that stuff literally [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=152.64s)]
*  But to watch how he uses that to bring people to the table and look whether you think that's a good [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=156.0s)]
*  tactic or not what this his staff maintains and what we've seen time and time again from Trump is [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=163.4s)]
*  sowing the kind of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=168.6s)]
*  Pearl clutching or the concerns or the uncertainty or the chaos is part of his strategy [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  And when the British Prime Minister says thank you, Mr. President for changing the conversation [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=175.54s)]
*  about Ukraine and Russia [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=180.84s)]
*  That's a Trump win [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=183.0s)]
*  absolutely, and I was speaking with a [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=185.16s)]
*  Senior official with a NATO country earlier the week who did speaking about that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=188.44s)]
*  Duterte ship line from the president it did rattle a lot of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=194.04s)]
*  Also what I would note from today what I saw I know I know Dasha was in the room [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=199.92s)]
*  But what I saw was like the the strategy I thought that the Prime Minister had today was similar to my crone [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=204.24s)]
*  Which was not about this. It wasn't about [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=210.36s)]
*  This the certain aggressive tone or tenor it was more about it was flattering [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=213.08s)]
*  Yes, it was a sense of it was a common ground stuff [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=217.48s)]
*  Yes, in a sense of like in that so far so far it was it went so far as when a reporter [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  Wisely asked the British Prime Minister. Hey, what about Canada? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  Does the king have any concerns about losing a part of his realm? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=229.72s)]
*  Starmer like buried it like you're trying to drive a wedge between us [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=233.24s)]
*  Next question or forget it, but what you hear both with starmer and with McCrone is they're trying to give Trump a win telling him [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=237.64s)]
*  Hey, you're doing something historic and what would be super historic. Mr. President if there was a security guarantee [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=244.56s)]
*  Exactly exactly so they're in their own history real history [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=252.88s)]
*  They know that pushing him on that isn't gonna work [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=256.0s)]
*  But if they flatter him and they make sure that he sees it as something that's good for him [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=258.88s)]
*  Then that might actually pull through so I want to play something we've pulled together which is a [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=262.90000000000003s)]
*  Compendium a mash-up if you will of what the president and what Elon Musk have said about the federal workforce. Let's listen [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=269.62s)]
*  We're cutting down government. We're cutting down the size of government. We have to we're bloated [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=277.82000000000005s)]
*  We're sloppy. We have a lot of people that aren't doing their job. We have a lot of people that don't exist they get wealthy [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=282.90000000000003s)]
*  We're done. Why where does it come from? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=289.98s)]
*  And I think the reality is that they're getting wealthier to touch their expense [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=292.66s)]
*  We're removing all of the unnecessary incompetent and corrupt bureaucrats from the federal workforce. That's what we're doing [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=297.22s)]
*  So either they don't exist or they do exist [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=305.26000000000005s)]
*  But they're getting wealthy or they're sloppy and bloated which means they're not smart enough to get wealthy [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=308.70000000000005s)]
*  I'm not quite sure what it all is about Dasha. The messaging on Doge has been all over the place [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=314.58000000000004s)]
*  What I keep hearing is [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=320.46000000000004s)]
*  President Trump is still very much on board with what Musk is doing [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=322.66s)]
*  He's telling him to be more aggressive now the people around Trump that are concerned about [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=326.62s)]
*  What this might mean for him down the line like that? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=332.18s)]
*  USAID a lot of the base was frustrated with an agency like that. That was low-hanging fruit. That was easy now [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=335.70000000000005s)]
*  You're starting to maybe hit the bone a little bit with where he's going and that is where his staff is concerned [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=341.06s)]
*  Especially when he sends out an email the five things email right did not run by that by [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=346.36s)]
*  The the senior staff at the White House [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=352.28s)]
*  They could have told him that hey, this might not be the best approach point being [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=354.52s)]
*  The theory of Doge a lot of people are behind the execution is where a lot of folks in the White House those people's the people [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=359.04s)]
*  Closest to Trump are concerned and fitted struck me as I'm sure it struck you and Dasha yesterday [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=366.3s)]
*  Musk standing at the cabinet meeting sure looking down on all the cabinet secretaries speaking first [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=370.98s)]
*  Pardon me speaking first. Yes [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=377.14s)]
*  That is the pinnacle [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=380.1s)]
*  Okay, there's gonna be another cabinet meeting in this presidency if Musk isn't there [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=382.5s)]
*  Then it's your your [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=389.46s)]
*  No longer as important [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=392.26s)]
*  I mean unless you're gonna come to every cabinet meeting and stand up and lecture everyone like you did the first time [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=393.82s)]
*  But if he doesn't the first time that happens he's diminished and this [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=399.18s)]
*  Relationship with the cabinet and Trump is going to be under constant scrutiny. Oh, absolutely [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=403.9s)]
*  And I think you know, I think reading the tea leaves there reading that imagery that we saw [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=408.54s)]
*  Yesterday, like you said, it is a pinnacle. Let's see how that how that goes. We remember [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=413.7s)]
*  I mean, it's the closest thing [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=418.98s)]
*  I would compare to his relationship with Steve Bannon earned early Trump and Trump 1.0 and that changed dramatically [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=420.18s)]
*  Look, it could be different. It could be a different dynamic [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=425.94s)]
*  But as we all know covering Trump for years now things change and they can change rather quickly [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=429.02s)]
*  And Dasha very quickly political has a piece about [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=434.66s)]
*  Democratic state attorneys general thinking they have found the proper legal flex against the Trump administration [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=437.1s)]
*  What's not all about? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=443.82s)]
*  Well, and one big piece of that strategy is they started preparing what they were expecting to need to battle early on [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=444.38s)]
*  This was a plan that they coordinated before January 20th [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=452.56s)]
*  Not a whole lot of the Democratic Party has been thinking that way [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=456.08s)]
*  So they're trying to be sort of a model to show look you can band together [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=459.16s)]
*  You need to be on the same page to resist some of the stuff. I don't see that happening really anywhere else [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=463.24s)]
*  With with Democrats right now except for the these attorneys general and they've had some success [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=468.92s)]
*  Because the only way to really battle with executive orders are with litigious action [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=474.52s)]
*  It's a very smart by the Democratic age ease Dasha Burns finn-gomez and your assembled titles. Thank you. Thank you [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEuUYSD2Dg&t=478.68s)]
