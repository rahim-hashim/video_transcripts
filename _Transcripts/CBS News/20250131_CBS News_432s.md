# Officials still working to recover remaining bodies from midair D.C. plane crash
**CBS News:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk)
*  We've been listening to officials in Washington D.C. particularly John Donnelly, the fire and EMS chief [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=0.0s)]
*  in D.C. give an update on the deadly midair collision Wednesday evening in Virginia just [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=5.68s)]
*  outside of our nation's capital. He said there are 41 remains in total of the 67 believed to be [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=10.96s)]
*  dead that have been recovered, 28 have been positively identified and as of 6 a.m. this [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=18.56s)]
*  morning next of kin notifications have been made to 18 families. I also said obviously this is a [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=23.76s)]
*  very tough response for their people, for their responders who are working the scene, which you [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=29.92s)]
*  can only imagine is an understatement. Let's go to CBS News correspondent Skylar Henry who is inside [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=35.6s)]
*  that briefing and is at Reagan National Airport with the latest. And Skylar you asked a question [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=41.52s)]
*  regarding the conditions for recovery, whether it is impacting the recovery and whether they fear [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=45.44s)]
*  that they won't be able to recover all of the bodies. What was the response? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=52.64s)]
*  Yeah, two parts to that. There is rain in this forecast here in Washington D.C. for the rest of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=55.84s)]
*  the day. The fire chief Donnelly spoke to that saying that they train for these types of conditions [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=63.36000000000001s)]
*  year-round and so they feel as if this will not impact their recovery process up until this point. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  In addition to that, resources coming in to help try to figure out exactly where the rest of these [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=73.76s)]
*  bodies may be. On that front, there was a question that was asked talking about the removal of the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=80.08s)]
*  debris and whether taking out parts of the fuselage will help them recover the rest of the remains. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=86.64s)]
*  The chief as well as other officials say that they felt confident that that might lead to the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=94.56s)]
*  discovery of the rest of those remains. As you pointed out, only 41 of the 67 have been recovered [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=100.32s)]
*  up until this point. 28 positively ID'd and then, yes, 18 next of kin families have been notified. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=107.2s)]
*  And so there is still a long way to go in this process. We have spoken with the Coast Guard, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=114.64s)]
*  who've talked about the number of cruise resources as well as part of the unified command here [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=118.56s)]
*  in the D.C. area along the Potomac that is helping with this recovery process as well. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=124.0s)]
*  Something else to point out here has been how this has impacted the airport. We know that two [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=128.96s)]
*  runways, there are normally three here at Reagan National Airport that are in service. Two runways [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=134.48s)]
*  have been closed that's referred to as the crossed wind runways, so to speak. They've been closed [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=139.44s)]
*  so as not to jeopardize the recovery process in all of this. We know that it is a reduced capacity [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=146.88s)]
*  in terms of the operational standpoints here at Reagan National as well. The number of flights [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=154.32s)]
*  that typically come in and out of here around 800 flights a day. There have already been 100 [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=159.36s)]
*  cancellations here so far throughout the day. Today, officials say that there will be a slow but steady [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=164.0s)]
*  bounce back, so to speak. They anticipate at least a week before those runways open back up and this [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=170.16000000000003s)]
*  airport will be fully operational. And Skylar, since we last talked to you, the Army has released [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=175.28s)]
*  the names of at least two of the deceased soldiers from the Black Hawk helicopter. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=182.16000000000003s)]
*  Staff Sergeant Ryan Austin O'Hara of Georgia, whom we have identified as a news network. Also, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=186.56s)]
*  the remains of Chief Warrant Officer Andrew Lloyd Eaves of Maryland. Those remains haven't been [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=193.04s)]
*  recovered yet and at the request of the family, the name of the third soldier will not be released [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=199.92s)]
*  at this time. And it is believed also that that soldier's remains have not been recovered yet. But [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=204.48s)]
*  interestingly, Chief Donnelly said that a salvage crew was on scene, Coast Guard cutters are on [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  scene. But the salvage crew is on scene. Do assess how to recover the aircraft from the water and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=215.52s)]
*  that they hope to start that by tomorrow afternoon? Yeah, yeah. And we will get a bit of details as [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=221.12s)]
*  far as the breakdown on the recovery process. What many experts have said is that the fuselage [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=230.72s)]
*  itself would have to be removed and put onto either a barge or some sort of apparatus that could [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=237.44s)]
*  get it out of the way, quite frankly, so that the recovery process can continue. The chief also said [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=242.48s)]
*  that they have searched a pretty significant portion of the river already. And I think based [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=249.6s)]
*  off of what they have able to find up until this point, they feel is pretty confident as to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=254.88s)]
*  the rest of the remains being perhaps under or close to where the parts of the fuselage [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  may be. Remember, officials said that at least upon initial impact, it broke into three pieces. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=268.16s)]
*  And so there are certainly challenges with moving around. We expect to get more details on that [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=273.28s)]
*  process tomorrow as they continue to work through this recovery effort. I thought that several [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=278.4s)]
*  questions were interesting to specifically the VP of the airport. And you sort of sidestepped those [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=284.32s)]
*  questions and referred us to the FAA, referred journalists to the FAA. But one of the questions [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=290.8s)]
*  was if you ever raised concerns about the crowded airspace with the FAA, his response was that safety [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=296.24s)]
*  was one of our top priorities. But that reporter continued to press and said that there have been [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  near misses. Did you bring that up with the FAA? What was the response? Yeah, it was a yes or no [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=307.2s)]
*  question. And it was answered that you would have to take that up with the FAA. The concerns about [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=314.0s)]
*  the congestion would have to be taken up with federal lawmakers as well. And that is something [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  that we have heard for the last several days. And so really, this is going to be something that we [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=324.96s)]
*  will continue to press. The NTSB has indicated that they will be answering some of those questions [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=334.0s)]
*  as well as part of this investigation. And really, these are going to be questions that lawmakers [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=339.35999999999996s)]
*  raise as well, several of whom not only raise their concerns about the congestion here at [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=343.35999999999996s)]
*  Reagan National Airport, but as it relates to military training and rehearsals and practices [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=349.2s)]
*  and missions that happen in this region as well, and whether that should continue or should they [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=355.68s)]
*  try to do something else moving forward, given the amount of concerns that have brewed up in this [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=361.76s)]
*  entire airport airspace for the last several years. And so there is going to be a lot of [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=368.88s)]
*  unanswered questions, a lot of questions asked, I should say, for several different officials, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=376.0s)]
*  for the FAA, for NTSB, for lawmakers as they try to decide how they're going to move forward. There [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=381.44s)]
*  should also be a lot of questions raised as well about what happens personnel-wise as it relates to [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=386.24s)]
*  air traffic control. That is going to be something else that I think a lot of people will be curious [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=391.76s)]
*  about as it relates to staffing. We know that for years there have been concerns around air traffic [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=396.72s)]
*  control staffing in and out of those towers, some of whom saying that they have to work around the [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=402.96s)]
*  conditions presented to them, and that's funding and that's personnel. And so they say that they [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=407.44s)]
*  are going to have to do several different things in order to try to figure out what those best [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=412.08s)]
*  practices might have to be, given the strains on the system as it currently presents. And so I [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=417.03999999999996s)]
*  think there is going to be a big review process in all aspects of this to try to make sure that [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=422.88s)]
*  something like what happened earlier this week doesn't happen again. Skyler Henry, thank you. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g7qO1lnxDk&t=427.12s)]
