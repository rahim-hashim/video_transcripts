# Trump pulling U.S. out of U.N. Human Rights Council, ending funding for UNRWA
**CBS News:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM)
*  We want to bring you now back to our top story, as the international community reacts to President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump's comments that the United States should take over the Gaza Strip and rebuild it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=4.32s)]
*  In another move yesterday, the United States has withdrawn from the United Nations Human [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=8.76s)]
*  Rights Council and has ended funding from Palestinian relief agency UNRWA. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=12.76s)]
*  I want to bring in Reuters White House reporter Jeff Mason to talk about this. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Jeff, it's good to see you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  So, UNRWA has been a controversial topic, with the Israelis claiming that it has employed [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=22.56s)]
*  members who supported Hamas. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=28.2s)]
*  But talk about the impact that what the United States is doing, what impact that could have [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=30.4s)]
*  on the agency. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  It has been a controversial group, and President Biden, President Trump's predecessor, also [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=37.4s)]
*  put a pause on funding after it was found that there were members of UNRWA who were [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=44.32s)]
*  part of the October 7 attacks on Israel. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=49.0s)]
*  So there is some bipartisan concern about the organization. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=52.2s)]
*  To your broader question, Vlad, it is an organization that provides aid to Palestinians, hundreds [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=56.16s)]
*  of millions of dollars worth. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=61.08s)]
*  So it's been a critical group in helping a population that has certainly been suffering [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=63.18s)]
*  quite a bit in these last couple years and before. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=70.66s)]
*  But you're right to mention the controversy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=74.68s)]
*  It is also a group that President Trump, during his first term, paused funding on. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  So this is not an unusual step for this Republican president. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=81.32s)]
*  So, Jeff, let's also talk about the action that's been taken against USAID. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  I think it's fascinating to me to look at the people on the internet who have absolutely [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=88.84s)]
*  no idea what they're talking about when it comes to understanding how this agency was [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=94.48s)]
*  created and what is happening at this very moment. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  I want you to provide some clarity for our audience. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=103.04s)]
*  Yes, the agency was created by executive order under President Kennedy, but Congress, many, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=105.16000000000001s)]
*  many years later, made it an official agency. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=111.28s)]
*  Just explain that so people understand exactly what's going on here and what the role of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=114.8s)]
*  Congress would be if you were to completely disband it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=119.56s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=123.2s)]
*  It is an independent agency and supported by law. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=124.92s)]
*  And if the president wants to completely shut it down or move it into the State Department, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=127.98s)]
*  which is what his stated goal has been, then he'll need Congress to help him do that by [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=132.44s)]
*  passing a law along the same lines. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=137.36s)]
*  That is not inconsistent with another agency that he's trying to close, which is the Department [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=139.76s)]
*  of Education. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=143.64s)]
*  And we're expecting an executive order on that coming up fairly soon as well. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=144.78s)]
*  But he can't just do it by fiat. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  He can't just do it with an order Congress has to play ball. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=150.76s)]
*  And not everyone in the Senate is going to be on board with that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=154.12s)]
*  In general, also to your broader question, USAID is an aid organization that provides [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=157.82s)]
*  life-saving service, funding and volunteering and aid work around the globe. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=163.34s)]
*  And there's just a big question mark now over the impact that this is going to have, not [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=170.5s)]
*  to mention the impact on the workers who have been recalled or put on leave. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=175.82s)]
*  Jeff Mason, always great to have you to provide that reporting and that clarity we sorely [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  need. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=183.98000000000002s)]
*  Appreciate it, my friend. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=185.98000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJFYuqBBhYM&t=186.98000000000002s)]
