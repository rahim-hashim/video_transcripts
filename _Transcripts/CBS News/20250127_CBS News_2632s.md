# More Trump executive orders expected, DeepSeek alarms U.S. stock market, more | CBS News 24/7
**CBS News:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc)
*  Today, there are more executive, executive orders coming. We fully support on removing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=0.0s)]
*  DEI inside the Pentagon, reinstating troops who were pushed out because of COVID mandates, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=14.24s)]
*  Iron Dome for America. This is happening quickly. And as the Secretary of Defense, it's an honor [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  to salute smartly as I did as a junior officer and now as the Secretary of Defense to ensure [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=26.4s)]
*  these orders are complied with rapidly and quickly. And you heard it there, Defense Secretary Pete [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=31.52s)]
*  Hegseth. He says President Trump is following through on campaign promises today by reshaping [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=38.839999999999996s)]
*  the military with three new executive orders. And those orders include policies for transgender [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=44.12s)]
*  service members, a ban on several DEI initiatives and reinstating members of the military who were [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=50.12s)]
*  discharged for refusing to get the COVID vaccine. CBS News White House digital reporter Aaron Navarro [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  joins us now for the latest. Aaron, thank you so much for being here. Can you walk us through the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=63.04s)]
*  details of these orders? And do we have any idea of the timing here? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=67.28s)]
*  Hugo, good to be with you. As you mentioned, getting rid of DEI, quote, bureaucracy is an expected [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=71.88s)]
*  executive order here, something in line with Pete Hegseth as well as President Trump's agenda. There [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  is also an order expected to be about transgender service members instructing the Defense Department [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=87.16s)]
*  to create a policy regarding these members. It is not a flat out ban on these members serving in our [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=93.84s)]
*  military, but it's at least pushing the ball to see what policy the Defense Department creates. As you [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=99.84s)]
*  mentioned, there's also an order expected that will reinstate members of the military who were [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=104.24s)]
*  discharged for refusing to get the COVID vaccine just a couple years ago. And there's also expected [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=109.0s)]
*  to be action regarding creating an American Iron Dome, a similar type of missile defense shield that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=114.28s)]
*  Israel has expected to see progress in America on that issue within 60 days. We know that Trump today [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=120.52s)]
*  is in Florida, but we're expecting these orders to be signed at some point this afternoon or evening. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=128.48s)]
*  And we understand the White House also sent out a memo directing agencies to start identifying [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=133.76s)]
*  schedule employees. And these are people who have jobs involved in crafting policy and supervising [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=140.64s)]
*  attorneys. So how is this memo related to the executive order that Trump signed just last week? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, on day one, President Trump signed an executive order that would essentially make [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=151.72s)]
*  it easier to strip federal protections from these federal employees, making it easier to fire them. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=158.28s)]
*  As you mentioned, the memo talked about identifying schedule F employees. This was something that was [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=164.52s)]
*  mentioned in Project 2025, just last year, which gained a lot of attention. And it was as well with [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=169.8s)]
*  something that Trump wanted to do in his first term, seemed to run into a lot of red tape during [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=175.84s)]
*  the first attempt. But again, they're bringing it back into the second term, as they're looking to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=181.36s)]
*  remake the federal workforce and install a lot of Trump loyalists. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=186.44s)]
*  And Aaron, we know House Republicans descend on the Trump-Doral Golf Club for a party conference. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=190.68s)]
*  Trump is expected to address Congress members later today. Can you walk us through what we can expect to hear there? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=197.4s)]
*  Yeah, sort of a rallying cry for House Republicans as they look to settle Trump's agenda and whether [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=204.20000000000002s)]
*  it'll be in one big, beautiful bill, as he says, or two reconciliation bills. What topics to put in each [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=213.0s)]
*  House Republicans seem to be wanting to get more clarification from President Trump. We'll see what he says later today, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=219.0s)]
*  but definitely a rallying call just on his agenda when it comes to energy, immigration, and tax policy. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=225.0s)]
*  Okay, so the president is also talking to El Salvador about a potential asylum agreement. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=230.83999999999997s)]
*  Trump spoke with President Naib Bukele just days after being sworn into the White House. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=237.32s)]
*  How does this plan help Trump with his mass deportation agenda? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=242.52s)]
*  Yeah, the talks were about potentially importing or transporting non-El Salvadorian migrants to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  El Salvador. That would certainly help because they're starting to see a little bit with Colombia, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=257.48s)]
*  but potentially with other countries. Countries reject certain flights of migrants. El Salvador, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=261.32s)]
*  being an open partner, could certainly help with just the logistics of what Trump and his DHS [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=266.52s)]
*  and his mass deportation plan that he's looking to execute in the coming weeks. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=273.08s)]
*  Okay, CBS News White House digital reporter Aaron Navarro, thank you so much for your time today. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=277.4s)]
*  Now, it is the first day on the job for newly confirmed defense secretary Pete Hegseth, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=282.91999999999996s)]
*  and before he even walked up into the steps of the Pentagon today, he promised to bring [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=287.79999999999995s)]
*  major changes. CBS News senior national security correspondent Charlie Dagana is live at the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=292.84s)]
*  Pentagon. Charlie, thanks for being here. Can you tell us what changes will be made to DEI policies, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=298.67999999999995s)]
*  and what can we expect from an executive order relating to transgender troops? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=304.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, Mugo, we were here this morning when Secretary Hegseth, I'm gonna have to get used [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=311.4s)]
*  to saying that, walked up the steps of the Pentagon. You know, he said he was going to be an [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=316.28s)]
*  agent of change. He was actually here over the weekend holding meetings, but sort of officially [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=319.32s)]
*  this is day one. So let's start with the order for the transgender troops first. So according to a [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=324.2s)]
*  fact sheet that we've seen, it simply bans transgender people from serving in the military. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=330.2s)]
*  We don't have the exact numbers, but an advocacy group that I spoke with this morning put the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=335.96s)]
*  number in the thousands. There have been some estimates around 15,000. I wasn't steered away [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=340.92s)]
*  from that, but it's difficult because not every transgender service member has self-identified. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=345.56s)]
*  Some had already gone through the transition process before enlisting. Others might be somewhere [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=352.2s)]
*  along in the process. In fact, in the language of that fact sheet, the president himself explicitly [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=356.36s)]
*  refers to transgender people as trans identifying, which is contentious enough. So the argument, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=362.2s)]
*  and it's one that's supported by the incoming secretary, is that allowing transgender personnel [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=369.0s)]
*  to serve on the front lines, it undermines military readiness and unit cohesion. But it's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=374.84s)]
*  worth notice. This isn't an immediate blanket ban. This is an executive order. The DOD, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=381.32s)]
*  including Secretary Hegseth, they have to come up with a plan to implement the policy. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=386.91999999999996s)]
*  Now as far as DEI is concerned, it gets murky. So Secretary Hegseth's mission was made very clear. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=391.55999999999995s)]
*  He posted on X over the weekend, DOD, he wrote, does not equal DEI. He said no exceptions, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=399.64s)]
*  no name changes, no delays. And those who do not comply will no longer work here. Now again, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=406.03999999999996s)]
*  implementing that policy is going to be more difficult. So as I understand it, there's no [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=413.15999999999997s)]
*  sort of dedicated DEI department or personnel who work in those programs. So it'll take identifying [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=417.15999999999997s)]
*  who would be considered working towards DEI or those sort of policies. And that might come down [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=426.20000000000005s)]
*  to human resources when it comes down to personnel in this building. It's going to come down to the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=431.16s)]
*  individual branches when it comes to their own recruitment and training. So in the past few days, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=436.52000000000004s)]
*  they've already been trying to purge mentions of diversity from websites and training. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=440.76000000000005s)]
*  Lots of changes coming on that one for sure. Trump is expected to reinstate service members [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=446.36s)]
*  who were discharged for not getting vaccinated. What are the details here? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=451.16s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's right. Checking with individual services, because that's how we have to get this [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=454.92s)]
*  information, we estimate that roughly 8,000 service members were discharged for not taking [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=461.32s)]
*  part in the COVID vaccine program. So they were removed from the military back in 2021. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=466.28000000000003s)]
*  That order was rescinded by the Biden administration. Only a few dozen people [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=472.28000000000003s)]
*  came back to active duty, genuinely like 40 something. And that order was rescinded [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=477.32s)]
*  It might be different this time because not only is back pay on offer, but those personnel who were [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=484.76000000000005s)]
*  discharged will be returned to their original rank according to the directive. Again, this will all be [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=489.8s)]
*  in the implementation. So turning now to the previous administration, when President Joe Biden [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=496.36s)]
*  lifted the ban, not many people came back. So do we know if they will give back pay to all 8,000 [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=501.88s)]
*  troops, even if they aren't reinstated in the military? And how much could that possibly cost? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=508.36s)]
*  Right, exactly. You can see how complicated it gets, right? And as I said, only 43, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=515.0s)]
*  I mean, roughly 40 something came back of 8,000. So as I understand it, you know, some members were [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=519.7199999999999s)]
*  happy to be discharged, they didn't want to come back to the military. But that incentive is there, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=526.5999999999999s)]
*  right? So that back pay is there. And also the return to rank. Now that may be the hook. I'm not [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=530.8399999999999s)]
*  entirely sure that that back pay is paid if they don't come back. And it's also worth mentioning, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=537.24s)]
*  I've been drilling down to it a little bit, the way back pay works is it's offset by any income [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=541.9599999999999s)]
*  they may have made in their sort of civilian life. So it really, I hate the phrase, but in this term, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=546.76s)]
*  it applies, it really remains to be seen what that uptake is. Because 8,000 people, if you were to [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=553.0s)]
*  divide the average salary or multiply it 40,000 US service member, I don't know, it comes out to [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=559.4799999999999s)]
*  roughly $1.2 billion. If every single person came in, and all of that money was back paid. But again, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=566.52s)]
*  there are so many caveats there. Yeah, a lot of money we're talking about there. And obviously, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=574.28s)]
*  a lot of unknowns as well. But Charlie, thank you so much for your time. We really appreciate it. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=579.0s)]
*  Now, President Trump is making true to his campaign promise to crack down on illegal [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=584.6s)]
*  immigration. Just yesterday, ICE agents arrested almost 1000 people. That is a jump from the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=589.16s)]
*  593 arrests on Friday and 286 on Saturday. Now this includes a raid that happened early Sunday [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=595.56s)]
*  morning outside of Denver. And that is where the DEA says they arrested almost 50 people. The [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=604.4399999999999s)]
*  agency's Rocky Mountain Division posted these videos you're looking at right here online saying [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=611.0s)]
*  they busted a makeshift party. This raid reportedly targeted members of a Venezuelan gang. Officials [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=615.64s)]
*  say they seized drugs, weapons and even cash and security at the nation's border is also ramping [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=622.44s)]
*  up. CBS News correspondent Jason Allen reports from along the southern border in El Paso, Texas, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=629.48s)]
*  where hundreds of additional troops have been deployed. Here along the Texas border with [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=634.7600000000001s)]
*  Mexico, there are more troops that are now on the way to spread out along this border, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=641.32s)]
*  not just here in Texas, but the expectation is that they will be along this border for all four [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=646.84s)]
*  states between here in New Mexico and Arizona and California. There have already been about 2500 [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=652.04s)]
*  troops here, but now the United States is surging another 1500. There were some flights here to Texas [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=658.1999999999999s)]
*  Thursday of an initial group. There were some more that arrived Saturday. They're going to be [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=665.0799999999999s)]
*  at Fort Bliss, which is near where we are. The expectation is they'll receive a briefing there [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=670.36s)]
*  on their activities, probably some training, and they are working with Customs and Border [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=675.0799999999999s)]
*  Protection as well to kind of get a sense of where they're going to be, what their mission is, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=679.4s)]
*  and what their activities will be here. Now, those are not the only troops that are coming. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=683.64s)]
*  Just today, Texas, the state of Texas, decided it's going to send another 400 troops here as well. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=688.52s)]
*  The flights were leaving from both Fort Worth and from Houston this morning. Texas Governor Greg Abbott [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=695.9599999999999s)]
*  saying along with those troops, there would be C-130s, there would be Chinook helicopters, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=702.36s)]
*  and they will be joining as well this surge of troops along the border all the way from here [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=706.76s)]
*  to California. Back to you. Some of President Trump's most high-profile cabinet picks about [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=713.0s)]
*  to be grilled by Senate lawmakers will walk you through the nominees when we come back. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=719.56s)]
*  Welcome back. We want to take you to San Pedro, California, where federal law enforcement officials [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=723.96s)]
*  have an update on a major port smuggling case. They say nine defendants worked with China to [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=737.5600000000001s)]
*  bring millions of dollars worth of counterfeit products into the United States through Los [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=743.24s)]
*  Angeles ports. Now, the U.S. Acting Attorney of Central California said this about the [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=747.32s)]
*  investigation just moments ago. Ensuring the integrity of who and what comes into our country [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=751.96s)]
*  is critical to our border security and ultimately to our national security. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=762.0400000000001s)]
*  The nine defendants charged in the indictment participated in a wide-ranging scheme [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=770.84s)]
*  to circumvent inspections at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. The scheme involved [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=778.76s)]
*  logistics companies, warehouse owners, and corrupt truckers. They worked as criminal partners to defy [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=786.68s)]
*  U.S. customs laws to illegally smuggle enormous quantities of goods from China into the United States. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=799.88s)]
*  Eight of the nine defendants have been arrested. One defendant, the lead defendant, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=811.4s)]
*  who orchestrated the scheme is a fugitive and is believed to be in China. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=819.3199999999999s)]
*  Those defendants have been charged with a number of federal charges including conspiracy. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=824.12s)]
*  Officials say they face at least 20 years of prison time if convicted. Turning now to our [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=830.52s)]
*  nation's capital and the race to get President Trump's cabinet confirmed, lawmakers working [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=836.76s)]
*  overtime to make that happen. Two big names crossing the finish line over the weekend. First, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=842.44s)]
*  controversial pick for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and second, Kristi Noem, the head, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=848.44s)]
*  the new head rather, of Homeland Security. Here is what we're watching for this week. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=853.4s)]
*  Back-to-back confirmation hearings with some of the president's most vulnerable picks. Cash Patel, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=858.12s)]
*  the man vying to be the next FBI director and Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick to be the next director [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=864.04s)]
*  of national intelligence and of course Robert F. Kennedy Jr. up to lead the Health and Human [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=869.56s)]
*  Services Department. CBS News congressional correspondent Nicole Killian is live from Capitol [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=875.0s)]
*  Hill and she joins us now. Nicole, what and who will you be watching for this week? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=880.28s)]
*  Well there are a number of things we're going to be watching for. Obviously as soon as today we [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=888.52s)]
*  could see confirmation votes for the Treasury Secretary Scott Besson as well as Transportation [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=892.36s)]
*  Secretary or soon to be potentially Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. Their confirmations are up [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=897.16s)]
*  next on the docket in terms of the Senate floor and then of course there are a number of other [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=903.8s)]
*  nominees potentially that could see votes later this week who have already had their hearings. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=908.28s)]
*  For instance whether that be someone like Elise Stefanik who's vying for the UN ambassador or [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=913.56s)]
*  other nominees that the president has put forth. But with respect to some of these confirmation [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=919.88s)]
*  hearings you know you kind of highlighted those three who still remain some of the most controversial [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=925.4s)]
*  nominees for the president. In terms of RFK Jr. he will face two confirmation hearings this week [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=930.52s)]
*  both before the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate Help Committee which focuses more on health [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=936.52s)]
*  policy and then of course you have as you mentioned Cash Patel who has raised concerns for his [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=941.88s)]
*  position and stances on the so-called deep state and his views on the weaponization of government. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=947.24s)]
*  Of course he is the president's pick for FBI director and then of course you have Tulsi [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=952.76s)]
*  Gabbard who has been making the rounds on Capitol Hill but unclear whether or not she can muster up [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=957.48s)]
*  enough votes for a director of national intelligence. Some lawmakers have expressed [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=962.28s)]
*  concerns about her views towards Russia being too sympathetic trips she took to Syria during her time [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=967.64s)]
*  as a member of Congress so those inevitably are likely questions that could come up when she sits [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=974.1999999999999s)]
*  for her confirmation hearing later this week. So as of right now three Trump nominees are in place. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=978.92s)]
*  You've got Marco Rubio, Pete Hexeth and Kristi Noh. Many more to go of course Nicole who are we likely [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=985.48s)]
*  to see make it to that swearing-in ceremony next? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=991.32s)]
*  Well again as I mentioned you have confirmation votes coming up for Scott Besson the treasury [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=996.6800000000001s)]
*  secretary as Sean Duffy for transportation. You know as I mentioned earlier we saw Elise [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1001.4000000000001s)]
*  Stefanik go through her confirmation hearing. She is likely to win bipartisan support to become the [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1006.44s)]
*  next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and others you know the HUD nominee among others [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1010.84s)]
*  you know energy. Those are some of the other picks who have kind of at least had those [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1018.76s)]
*  confirmation hearings and then are just kind of waiting for a vote to be scheduled on the floor. So [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1023.0s)]
*  leader Thune has made clear he wants to move as quickly as possible on all of these nominations. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1029.24s)]
*  That's why you saw people like Pete Hexeth and Kristi Noh get confirmed over the weekend because [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1033.72s)]
*  they want to help enable the president to move forward with his agenda and despite the controversy [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1039.6399999999999s)]
*  that some of these nominees may bring still with a Republican controlled Congress so the majority of [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1044.92s)]
*  them are expected to get the votes they need to advance. And we know you'll keep an eye on that. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1050.68s)]
*  Nicole while we have you here we are hours away from President Donald Trump addressing [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1056.04s)]
*  house Republicans at their annual policy retreat. They are all meeting at the Trump Doral Golf [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1060.6000000000001s)]
*  Resort in Miami Florida and we understand top GOP leaders will lay out their legislative agenda [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1065.72s)]
*  so what exactly can we expect from that? Yeah that's right well they'll be meeting for the next [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1071.88s)]
*  three days at Doral which is as you mentioned President Trump's resort down in Florida one of [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1078.2800000000002s)]
*  several that he owns but really the focus of this retreat is on the path forward once again to [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1084.68s)]
*  advance the president's agenda as you know and as we have seen the president has laid forth a number [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1091.88s)]
*  of executive actions with respect to the border and immigration but there are also some legislative [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1098.1999999999998s)]
*  steps that need to be taken too particularly in terms of funding some of these priorities of the [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1104.6799999999998s)]
*  president so basically house Republicans are strategizing around that they expect to use a [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1109.4799999999998s)]
*  process called reconciliation which is a budget maneuver to try to expedite some of these policy [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1113.8799999999999s)]
*  proposals whether that is dealing with border security energy extending the president's tax [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1119.4799999999998s)]
*  cut so what's unclear is whether or not this will be one big package as we heard our Aaron Navarro [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1125.08s)]
*  mentioned earlier which is something the president has expressed support for or whether they will [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1129.56s)]
*  split it up into two parts which is more what senators seem to favor so this is really about [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1133.6399999999999s)]
*  kind of honing in a kind of getting a clear path going forward because the speaker has made clear [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1138.9199999999998s)]
*  he wants to move forward with this legislative package as soon as next month. Okay CBS News [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1143.08s)]
*  congressional correspondent Nicole Killian thank you so much for your time today. We are used to [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1148.6s)]
*  hearing about earthquakes in places like California but people on the east coast they got a jolt today [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1153.8s)]
*  an earthquake centered in Maine measured at a magnitude of 3.8 officials said no reports of [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1159.48s)]
*  immediate danger but to be aware of aftershocks let's listen in to CBS News Boston breaking the [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1165.8s)]
*  news from just moments ago. Our phones have been ringing off the hook in the newsroom as residents [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1171.56s)]
*  shared what they experienced and knew into the WBZ newsroom video from a bedroom in Kittery, Maine [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1177.4s)]
*  where you can see and hear the shaking from the quake so we have that for you we have team coverage [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1184.92s)]
*  as well starting with this is the bedroom that we were talking about and you can see the shaking [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1191.16s)]
*  right there. Let's begin with WBZ's Logan Hall in Weston where we know Logan you just spoke [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1195.8000000000002s)]
*  with the professor at the Boston College Observatory. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1203.48s)]
*  Yeah that's right good afternoon we are at the Boston College Weston Observatory where of course [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1208.76s)]
*  this machine right here is actually tracking seismic data and you can see here where that [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1213.56s)]
*  earthquake actually registered when it happened this causing scientists here to jump into full [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1218.9199999999998s)]
*  action pouring through and analyzing all of this data as it comes in in real time. Now they tell [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1225.48s)]
*  us that this is a big earthquake an event that's not very common for the area here in New England [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1230.92s)]
*  however it was not going to cause any significant damage just to shake things up. So this is a once [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1235.8000000000002s)]
*  in five year earthquake on average somewhere in New England and it's a good strong shake it will [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1242.76s)]
*  scare people but it's below the threshold for damage damage starts around magnitude 5.0 or so [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1248.68s)]
*  maybe 4.8 in some circumstances. So we're in order order of magnitude below that but it still [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1254.92s)]
*  can shake for maybe 20 or 30 seconds in places and really scare people. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1260.76s)]
*  So now of course this is something that will cause some aftershocks is what we're hearing now [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1270.1200000000001s)]
*  scientists here telling us to keep an eye out for those aftershocks that can continue over the course [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1274.04s)]
*  of the next day or so there already have been several reports of folks feeling those shakes [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1279.0s)]
*  happening after that big initial earthquake social media is definitely a buzz with people [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1283.56s)]
*  shaken up by this quake. Paula back to you. John, we appreciate it thanks so much. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1288.28s)]
*  All right let's bring in meteorologist Jessica Burch right now because Jessica we were talking [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1295.4s)]
*  about it we're used to this in California. Oh yeah not so much over there so that is a big deal for [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1299.32s)]
*  them. And the reaction time too think about it you feel an earthquake in California you're kind of like [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1305.32s)]
*  first thought is like oh it's happening again for them they're like what is happening right now a [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1309.48s)]
*  completely different feeling you know and this is just offshore there hasn't been any aftershocks [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1313.88s)]
*  just yet but we continue to keep a close eye on that. So I'm going to head over to the east coast [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1317.48s)]
*  real fast starting off just behind me I want to pull that graphic up one more time we continue to [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1320.92s)]
*  keep a close eye on if there are any aftershocks and if you're just tuning in now there was just [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1325.8s)]
*  around 10 22 this morning over on the east coast just offshore of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1329.8s)]
*  Vermont and Maine just as in this area alone actually New Hampshire and Maine there was a [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1334.9199999999998s)]
*  magnitude 3.8 earthquake and this is in the exact same area that's continuing to deal with more [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1339.6399999999999s)]
*  snow as we head into the afternoon and evening hours tonight. I want to pull back and pull up [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1345.48s)]
*  the map real fast too we have a couple clipper systems that are going to sweep throughout the [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1348.76s)]
*  Great Lakes pushing off into the mid-Atlantic and the northeast into the coming days there's that [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1352.76s)]
*  second one right behind me that you see starting to form as we head all the way into our Wednesday [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1357.8799999999999s)]
*  and Thursday forecast but right back behind me let's pull up those graphics one more time. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1361.64s)]
*  I want to show you how large these storms are going to be because in the grand scheme of things [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1366.2800000000002s)]
*  we can see anywhere up to around eight inches of snow accumulating from this exact system that [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1370.0400000000002s)]
*  we're seeing into late Monday night early Tuesday morning. Now with this there's plenty of winter [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1374.2800000000002s)]

*  Now we can see gusts up to around 40-50 miles per hour at times pushing across this area. We're [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1399.8s)]

*  more snow more heavy winds so it's going to be a little bit of a mess over there. Good thing that [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1413.8799999999999s)]

*  Federal officials ramped up arrests over the weekend and they say more are on the way and [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1466.76s)]
*  Chicago is just one of the cities that's been the target of recent immigration arrests and [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1471.4799999999998s)]
*  Trump's new border was there to oversee the operation. CBS News Chicago's Asah Rezaie reports [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1477.6399999999999s)]
*  from the Windy City. We're expecting federal agents to continue making arrests in the city [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1484.84s)]
*  over the next couple of days. We know right now their mission is to detain any undocumented [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1491.16s)]
*  people that have active warrants. They began those arrests yesterday and those will continue. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1496.68s)]

*  We know the targeted arrests began before dawn Sunday and went on into the late morning and one [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1506.92s)]
*  seems to be a collective federal effort. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents joined by the D.A. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1512.1200000000001s)]
*  FBI, ATF, Border Patrol and U.S. Marshals. Right now it's unclear how many people they arrested in [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1518.2s)]
*  Chicago, who those people are and what crimes they're accused of. Chicago police tell us though they [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1524.76s)]
*  did not assist. That's in accordance with local law. Here's what Homan said about the latest [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1530.28s)]
*  crackdown followed by 22nd ward alderman Michael Rodriguez. But you can see the numbers steadily [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1535.8s)]
*  increased and the number of us nationwide as we open up the aperture. The fact is that these [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1540.6000000000001s)]
*  fearful raids, these sinister raids are unjust and they're causing mayhem in our communities. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1545.0s)]

*  policy changes. CBS News Department of Justice reporter Jake Rosen joins us live with the latest [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1597.32s)]
*  Jake. Thank you for being with us today. Both the DOJ and the DHS are seeing huge policy shifts, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1603.0s)]
*  especially when it comes to immigration and deportation. So what's new with how the agencies [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1609.0s)]
*  are operating? So in a memo sent out last week by interim Deputy Director of the Department of [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1614.4399999999998s)]
*  Justice, who was an attorney for Donald Trump back in that New York court case early last year, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1622.84s)]
*  he set out strict guidelines for how the Department of Justice should move forward in terms of these [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1628.1999999999998s)]
*  deportations and targeted arrests as they're being called going forward into the next couple of weeks. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1633.6399999999999s)]
*  The big thing, as we know that Donald Trump has said out loud, would be mobilizing resources from [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1639.32s)]
*  across the government to while these government agencies have to stay in their lanes assist in [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1643.56s)]
*  what they're doing. And another thing that the Department of Justice is looking at is moving [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1648.04s)]
*  around resources and especially in terms of career attorneys, people who are not political appointees [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1652.36s)]
*  to basically take on states and localities that claim that they are sanctuary cities, which would [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1657.3999999999999s)]
*  mean like this reporter in Chicago just pointed out that the local officials and local police are not [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1661.6399999999999s)]
*  going to play a role in assisting with these arrests. The Trump administration has long made [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1666.76s)]
*  a point of and Trump campaign made a long point of on the campaign trail to really stay focused on [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1670.84s)]
*  attacking these cities and finding ways to coerce them into basically giving into federal pressure [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1675.4799999999998s)]
*  on things like deportations. So as all of this is happening we know as of right now the DOJ is [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1679.96s)]
*  operating without an attorney general or even a FBI director. So what is the likelihood that these [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1685.96s)]
*  Trump picks will get confirmed? Well in terms of Pam Bondi who is very likely to be the next [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1691.72s)]
*  attorney general of the United States, she was the attorney general back in Florida and a longtime [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1699.24s)]
*  supporter of Donald Trump going back to 2015 and 2016. She is very likely to be confirmed and while [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1703.48s)]
*  the hearing that she had a couple of weeks ago on Capitol Hill was a little contentious among [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1709.24s)]
*  Democrats, among Republicans there's basically an anonymous agreement of what role she should be [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1713.5600000000002s)]
*  especially coming out of that Matt Gaetz appointment and kind of collapse of his pick as attorney [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1719.24s)]
*  general back in November and December. Now in terms of Cash Patel things are a little bit different. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1724.0400000000002s)]
*  That process has been slowed down. There are a lot of skeptics within the Senate Judiciary Committee [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1729.3200000000002s)]
*  around Cash Patel and how his nomination should proceed. He's again another longtime ally of [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1734.36s)]
*  Donald Trump but with more extreme views on things like what we saw last week with the mass [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1739.0s)]
*  pardons of January 6th rioters. That's something that he has long called for in addition to [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1743.3999999999999s)]
*  potentially going after Democrats should he get put in place at the FBI. He's been a longtime [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1748.36s)]
*  critic of Democrat politicians, Democrat members of the Department of Justice in addition to general [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1753.56s)]
*  bureaucrats that he claims basically have have rigged their systems against Donald Trump before [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1759.1599999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump took office last week. All right Jake so as you said there we know Pam Bondi likely to [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1763.32s)]
*  get confirmed but in the meantime the DOJ handling a lot of new policy changes so how are they doing [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1769.3999999999999s)]
*  that given the vacuum in leadership as we wait for these confirmation hearings to take place? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1775.8799999999999s)]
*  Well there are temporary appointees in place who are doing Donald Trump's bidding already and while [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1782.6799999999998s)]
*  Pam Bondi is expected to take over potentially at some point this week we'll have to see how that [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1787.32s)]
*  plays out specifically but there are already things underway. Some of those things are again [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1791.4s)]
*  like what we just talked about with basically getting the ball moving on how the federal [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1795.48s)]
*  government is going to be involved in these mass deportation and targeted arrest efforts of [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1799.24s)]
*  legal migrants who have criminal records. Part of that too is slowing down and stopping further [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1804.0400000000002s)]
*  cases in terms of civil rights cases that the government involves themselves in, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1809.64s)]
*  slowing down police reform efforts and undoing what President Biden laid out to do in terms of [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1813.4s)]
*  executive orders on how the Department of Justice should proceed in terms of police reform across [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1817.8s)]
*  the country and another thing in terms of when we talk about these arrests and what the future [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1822.44s)]
*  of law enforcement is in America, the Trump administration in that memo pointed out that [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1826.28s)]
*  they want prosecutors to now look at the maximum possible penalties when it comes to going after [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1831.3999999999999s)]
*  people like these legal migrants in the country and who are being targeted and to not give [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1836.12s)]
*  prosecutors a leeway that the Biden administration and Biden White House gave these prosecutors to [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1840.6s)]
*  maybe go lighter on someone who maybe is an active member of their community and doing good [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1845.08s)]
*  things versus a criminal. The Trump administration is saying right now they need to fully stick to [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1850.28s)]
*  the strictest guidelines that they can in terms of sentencing. Okay, CBS News Department of Justice [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1855.32s)]
*  reporter Jake Rosen, thank you so much for your time today. Ahead details on a Chinese AI company [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1859.96s)]
*  that some experts say rivals chat GPT. You're watching CBS News 24 seven. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1866.4399999999998s)]
*  An artificial intelligence startup out of China has US big tech in a bit of a panic. It's called [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1875.8s)]
*  DeepSeek on Wall Street. It has tech stocks tumbling investors, investors fearing the [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1886.4399999999998s)]
*  newcomer could append the artificial intelligence craze and the domination of AI companies in the [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1892.1999999999998s)]
*  United States like in Vita and Open AI. So let's bring in CBS News Money Watch correspondent, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1897.8s)]
*  Kaley O'Grady. So, Kaley, a lot of questions here. Can you tell us what DeepSeek is and why does it [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1903.64s)]
*  have big tech companies trembling? Yes, so it's good to be with you. So DeepSeek, it is a Chinese [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1909.0s)]
*  AI company and over the weekend they released an AI assistant that's powered by their AI model. So [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1917.0800000000002s)]
*  everyone's kind of really excited about this but also concerned because they are seeing that it [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1924.8400000000001s)]
*  rivals chat GPT, it rivals Google's Gemini and the reason that there's so much concern is that it was [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1931.72s)]
*  made with a lot less money, a lot less time, and a lot less power. And so DeepSeek doesn't have access [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1938.76s)]
*  to the chips to the likes of or the most sort of advanced chips that Nvidia and Micron and these [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1946.92s)]
*  other companies put forth due to US export restrictions. And so everyone's kind of looking [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1953.08s)]
*  at this and saying, wow, this was able to be made without access to that really advanced computing [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1958.2s)]
*  power. And so you're seeing all of these tech stocks take a dip because if that's possible for [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1963.88s)]
*  this Chinese company to be able to create something so advanced without access to that power, it really [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1968.8400000000001s)]
*  questions whether these companies will have as much of a future when it comes to revenue and profits [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1975.0800000000002s)]
*  that all of these investors are betting on. So that's sort of the tech and the market side of it. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1980.92s)]
*  There's also a question around if these Chinese companies are advanced in this AI development, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1985.16s)]
*  what that could mean from a national security perspective, a military defense technology [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1991.8000000000002s)]
*  perspective. So a lot of different threads here but certainly a lot of the tech stocks are taking [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=1996.68s)]
*  it on the chin today. Yeah, definitely they are. So Kelly, we want to stay on the issue and the [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2001.96s)]
*  topic of China here because we're going to talk about the future of TikTok. We're hearing a [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2008.28s)]
*  potential buyer could give the U.S. government a 50% stake in the company. What exactly can you [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2012.36s)]
*  tell us about that? So this is a new bid that's put forth by a company called Perplexity AI. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2018.84s)]
*  It wouldn't be a takeover, it would actually be a merger. So the bite dance investors that [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2025.8799999999999s)]
*  that's the parent company behind TikTok would still retain a piece of the pie in this merger. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2031.3999999999999s)]
*  And then in the future when this company were to go public, the U.S. government would receive a 50% [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2037.24s)]
*  stake in the company. This is a pretty unique structure, it would be very complicated to put [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2043.96s)]
*  together. There is precedent that the U.S. government has owned public companies and I'll [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2048.44s)]
*  give you an example of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But given that TikTok is where a lot of discussion, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2053.88s)]
*  it's a free speech platform, there's concern would the U.S. government have a say in the strategy, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2060.76s)]
*  would they have a say in the operations of the company in the future. So certainly there's [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2066.12s)]
*  precedent but definitely raises a lot of concerns around what kind of control they might have over [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2072.2s)]
*  the platform. But I do want to mention this is just a proposal at this point. We haven't even [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2077.08s)]
*  heard if ByteDance is interested in pursuing some type of merger like this. All right, that's a [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2081.48s)]
*  good thing to know there, that last sentence. This is very, very much in the early stages. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2087.4s)]
*  Kelly, let's switch gears. We want to ask you about a headline from the Trump administration, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2092.2s)]
*  a trade war between the U.S. and Colombia narrowly avoided. What was going on there, what happened? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2096.68s)]
*  We got our sort of the first taste of what a tit for tat trade war would look like over the [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2105.3199999999997s)]
*  weekend. So the Colombian president basically said after Trump said, look, I'm going to put 25% [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2109.8799999999997s)]
*  tariffs, I would up that to 50% tariffs after a week. The Colombian president said, well, I'm [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2117.16s)]
*  going to slap 25% tariffs back on top of you. And it's sort of this escalation that we're concerned [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2122.2799999999997s)]
*  as we are seeing the president consider tariffs on Mexico, Canada, China, a number of other [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2130.3599999999997s)]
*  countries. You think through what we get from Colombia, coffee, fresh cut flowers, petroleum, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2135.8799999999997s)]
*  you could see those start to spike if these tariffs were put in place. Of course, we know [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2143.0s)]
*  how this all ended. The president of Colombia ended up capitulating to president Trump's demands [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2148.28s)]
*  and everything sort of simmered down. So not only did it show what a tit for tat trade war could be, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2154.52s)]
*  but it also showed the power of the threat of these tariffs. It might actually be a very good [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2159.56s)]
*  negotiation tactic, rather, as the president has said he will use them as such going forward. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2164.92s)]
*  Okay, CBS News Money Watch watch correspondent, Kelly O'Grady. Thank you so much [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2171.2400000000002s)]
*  for joining us on the stream today. Still ahead on CBS News 24 seven, we were just talking about [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2176.12s)]
*  the White House showdown with Colombia. Now we have a breaking news update just moments ago [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2181.64s)]
*  on those deportation flights that made president Trump threaten tariffs. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2186.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2200.44s)]
*  It is our eye on America. CBS News telling you about issues you face in your communities. And it [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2214.92s)]
*  can be hard to imagine experiencing the loss of one home from a wildfire, let alone two. CBS News, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2219.4s)]
*  Colorado's Gabriella Vidal shows you what one family faces right now with the wildfires [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2226.12s)]

*  This is our backyard. Taking us through the wreckage of what's left of their childhood [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2238.2799999999997s)]
*  home in Altadena, California. We kind of knew like it was already burned, so we were prepared. We had [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2242.6s)]
*  a day to prepare before we came. It's like shock part of it. It's like you're mostly okay, but like [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2248.2799999999997s)]
*  it's also you're not 22 years of memories in this home. I'll miss all of it now reduced to [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2254.44s)]
*  ruins like many others amidst the ongoing eaten fire. When you look at the pictures and the videos, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2259.7200000000003s)]
*  you realize how many people are hit by this images that bring him back to these from 2021. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2265.48s)]
*  I was in a movie with my family back in California, and I got these texts, people saying, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2271.88s)]
*  are you okay? Is your house okay? When Christian lost his home in Superior during the Marshall [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2278.44s)]
*  Fire was just like I have nothing I can do, and I don't know what I'm coming back to. And he says [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2283.48s)]
*  it took a lot of time in a community of loved ones to help him get back on his feet. Then I just had [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2289.2400000000002s)]
*  the sense of peace to even in that time that, you know, the rest of my life that would be would not [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2294.2s)]
*  have been unless that moment had happened as well. Now he's crowdfunding to help his family move [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2301.08s)]
*  forward, help them walk through it and like remind them like you don't need to be okay. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2306.04s)]
*  It's not an okay thing. Despite the loss, we have like a terracotta pot that survives. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2311.16s)]
*  His family is finding comfort in the little things that were salvaged. Temporarily, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2316.3599999999997s)]
*  we'll be staying in a hotel for about a week, this next week or so. And then after that, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2321.16s)]
*  my parents are looking at like a place to rent and remaining hopeful. We have big trees, these old [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2325.96s)]
*  houses, such beautiful homes. They will be able to rebuild their community, try to keep the character [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2332.52s)]
*  of Altadena alive is our main thing. And just like Colorado and stepped up to help people like [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2339.64s)]
*  Christian during the Marshall fire. In any way you can try to give, give. I'm Gabrielle Lavedal, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2344.2799999999997s)]
*  CBS News Colorado. Weekend rain gave crews in Southern California some much needed relief as [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2349.96s)]
*  they continue to battle the flames, but the rain is leading to concerns about mudslides and even [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2357.3199999999997s)]
*  flooding in burns car areas. Mud flows in the Pacific Palisades area close roads along the [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2363.3199999999997s)]
*  popular Pacific Coast Highway and prompted schools in Malibu to close for today. So let's bring in [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2369.08s)]
*  meteorologist Jessica Birch because we were talking about this last week. The first thing I thought [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2374.7599999999998s)]
*  is when you're talking about wildfires, of course you want rain, you need rain, right? Then it's [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2378.84s)]
*  causing some issues now. Well, the good news is the National Weather Service just within the past [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2383.72s)]
*  hour actually expired that flood watch just along the fire burn scar area for the Palisades fire. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2387.48s)]
*  So this is good news. We're starting to see that storm shift out of the Southern California area [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2392.68s)]
*  and now it's moving closer to Arizona all the way over into states like New Mexico as we head [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2397.16s)]
*  into the coming days. You see it just below me starting to swirl its way off of California, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2402.68s)]
*  moving its way inland throughout the next couple days. Now right behind me I want to show you [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2407.72s)]
*  areas like Los Angeles, LAX alone got close to around an inch of rain. You head over into [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2411.96s)]
*  Malibu closer to two and a half. Of course inevitably after fire weather conditions [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2416.68s)]
*  and a heavy setup of rain, the biggest concern would be mudslides or debris flow at least. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2421.48s)]
*  As we extend into the next couple days, this will come to an end, these concerns. Now of course we [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2426.68s)]
*  shift our eyes over into the four corners where they're expected to see some moderate to heavy [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2431.4s)]
*  snow right around the corners. We head into Wednesday and Thursday forecast too. That'll [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2436.52s)]
*  bring in a different weather pattern for them but back all the way over into Los Angeles we go. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2441.64s)]
*  We're starting to see the next 24 hours, those showers really tapering off areas like Barstow, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2446.04s)]
*  Wrightwood receiving close to around a tenth of an inch at max down into Southern California [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2450.6s)]
*  closer to the border, a similar trend close to areas like San Diego. So things are changing [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2455.0s)]
*  and changing for the better honestly. We dealt with such a unique event with those strong Santa [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2460.28s)]
*  Ana winds causing fire weather conditions then the rain causes another issue but I think they're [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2464.84s)]
*  going to finally get a breath of fresh air this week. So happy to hear that, glad to hear they're [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2469.24s)]
*  finally getting some relief. Of course. Thank you Jessica. And we want to bring you to Miami now, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2472.92s)]
*  Republican congressman Carlos Jimenez held a press conference addressing immigration plans [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2477.56s)]
*  under the Trump administration. Now following... ISIS is doing the job it's supposed to be doing [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2482.68s)]
*  which is once you have a deportation order then you're supposed to carry out that deportation [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2489.48s)]
*  order. Now in my my druthers I'd rather actually have those that are more recent, okay we'll go [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2494.04s)]
*  first, but also all depends on the on the nature of the crime and the crime that you committed [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2501.3199999999997s)]
*  while you were here. And so I don't have the details of that but again all of this all this [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2505.8799999999997s)]
*  talk and this problem with immigration came about because of the last four years of the Biden... [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2510.52s)]
*  And congressman Jimenez you just heard from is one of dozens of Republican house members in Florida [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2515.8s)]
*  attending a conference with Trump and following the search for answers into the origins of the [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2520.52s)]
*  COVID-19 virus the CIA saying the virus was most likely leaked from a lab and was not an engineered [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2526.12s)]
*  bio weapon. The Biden era team though saying there is low confidence in this finding because they [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2533.2400000000002s)]
*  never had a smoking gun and that investigators were not allowed into the country to probe and [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2539.08s)]
*  Chinese officials didn't thoroughly share information with the World Health Organization. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2544.68s)]
*  We're used to hearing about earthquakes in places like California but the people on the [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2550.92s)]
*  east coast got a jolt today an earthquake centered in Maine measured at a magnitude of 3.8. People as [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2555.08s)]

*  to be aware of aftershocks. Now this is one I know a lot of people are talking about the Philadelphia [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2568.68s)]
*  Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs head to the Super Bowl for a rematch two years in the making. They [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2573.96s)]
*  met in 2023 during that Super Bowl when the Chiefs barely edged out the Eagles 38 to 35. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrbd0faMtc&t=2578.9199999999996s)]
