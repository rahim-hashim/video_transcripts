*  that email went out, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=16.68s)]
*  Elon Musk, the head of the Department [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=18.32s)]
*  of Government Efficiency previewed [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=21.04s)]
*  that email and acts saying quote [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=22.76s)]
*  failure to respond will be taken [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=25.080000000000002s)]

*  Now, despite that threat, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=28.52s)]
*  here is the list of government [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=29.76s)]

*  directive telling their employees to not [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=33.96s)]
*  respond. It includes the FBI, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=36.24s)]
*  State Department, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=38.32s)]

*  with more and all of this. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=46.08s)]
*  Olivia, thanks for being here today. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=47.96s)]
*  What are these agencies saying and why [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=49.96s)]
*  are they telling their employees to not respond? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=52.28s)]
*  Hey Mugo, it's good to be with you. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=54.96s)]
*  The six words that shocked [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=57.76s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=59.36s)]
*  What did you do last week? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=60.4s)]
*  Elon Musk requesting five bullet points [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=62.24s)]
*  about what they did and they have to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=64.36s)]
*  turn it in by 5 PM today and no [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=66.68s)]
*  response means that they are [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=69.08s)]
*  accepting resignation. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=70.92s)]
*  So we're already seeing some [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=71.72s)]
*  pushback from federal agencies [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=73.34s)]
*  and this is really some of the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=74.68s)]
*  first pushback we have been seeing [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=76.76s)]
*  from Trump's cabinet secretaries [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=78.76s)]
*  against Elon Musk and Doge and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=80.36s)]
*  their efforts to cut down on the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=82.48s)]
*  amount of money they have to cut [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=84.56s)]
*  spending. This is been largely [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=87.08s)]
*  some pushback that we're seeing [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  from these secretaries. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=90.72s)]
*  Let me just walk you through what [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=91.52s)]
*  some of them have said. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=93.44s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, the director of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=94.8s)]
*  National Intelligence, told her [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=96.56s)]
*  employees not to respond because a [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=98.12s)]
*  lot of the work that National [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=100.08s)]
*  Intelligence does is highly critical, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=101.88s)]
*  highly classified and probably not [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=103.48s)]
*  something that should be responded to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=105.04s)]
*  in a reply all email of what they [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=106.92s)]
*  did for last week. The undersecretary [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  for personnel and readiness and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=111.80000000000001s)]
*  their personnel and readiness in [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=113.64s)]
*  the Pentagon wrote in a post and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=115.52s)]
*  put it on X, quote, when and if [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=117.6s)]
*  required, the department will [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=119.52s)]
*  coordinate responses to the email [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  you've received from OPM. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=122.8s)]
*  For now, please pause any response [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=123.96s)]
*  to the OPM email titled What did [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=125.96s)]
*  you do last week? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=128.16s)]
*  So this is just some of the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=129.64s)]
*  pushback we're starting to see [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=130.68s)]
*  from these secretaries and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=132.32s)]
*  undersecretaries against Elon Musk [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=133.92s)]
*  and Doge and their requirements [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=136.44s)]
*  for response. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  But this still raises a lot of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  questions, namely, who is going [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=141.96s)]
*  to be combing through the millions [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=144.52s)]
*  of emails that they are expected [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=145.88s)]
*  to be responded that Elon Musk [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=147.44s)]
*  is expecting a response from? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=149.88s)]
*  One, if they did not reply, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  who will be tracking who did not [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=153.88s)]
*  reply? And also, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=155.32s)]
*  what if they responded but didn't [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=158.52s)]
*  answer the five things or that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=159.88s)]
*  prompt? This is such a broad [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  email to send to millions of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  federal workers requiring them to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=165.8s)]
*  respond. But what's the next step? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=167.56s)]
*  That's what we've been asking and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=169.8s)]
*  what we'll be watching very, very [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=171.16s)]
*  closely. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=172.68s)]
*  Olivia, staying on that topic, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=174.24s)]
*  Sean Duffy, that's the Department [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=175.96s)]
*  of Transportation Secretary. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=177.76s)]
*  He shed his list of his [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=179.24s)]
*  accomplishments on acts this [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  morning. What exactly did it say? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=182.4s)]
*  Well, if there is one cabinet [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=186.76s)]
*  secretary that appears to be [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=187.92s)]
*  complying with this email, it is [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=189.04s)]
*  Sean Duffy at the Department of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=190.44s)]
*  Transportation. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=192.24s)]
*  He listed out five things. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=193.16s)]
*  Let me just read through his list. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=194.76s)]
*  He said, Mr. President, five things [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=196.24s)]
*  I did last week. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=197.56s)]
*  He lists terminating [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=198.92s)]
*  congestion pricing in New York. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=200.76s)]
*  He said he launched an [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=202.6s)]
*  investigation into the California [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=203.64s)]
*  high speed rail project that cost [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  several billion dollars. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  He said he saved 10 million a year [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  by eliminating redundant and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=210.12s)]
*  outdated landlines across the U.S. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=211.44s)]
*  He also visited the Air Traffic [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=213.6s)]
*  Control Command Center in Virginia [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=215.12s)]
*  to talk about tech upgrades to that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=218.32s)]
*  system. And then he went out to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=219.88s)]
*  Burbank, California and visited [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=221.28s)]
*  that control tower out there [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  where he said he heard from air [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=224.68s)]
*  traffic controllers about how to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=225.84s)]
*  improve conditions and retain [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=226.84s)]
*  and recruit more controllers. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=228.56s)]
*  I should note, though, that this [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=231.08s)]
*  email still caused confusion and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=232.52s)]
*  concern among the Air Traffic [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=235.0s)]
*  Controllers Union, who wondered [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=236.64s)]
*  if their employees need to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=238.52s)]
*  respond to this to say what five [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=239.92s)]
*  things they did last week. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=241.64s)]
*  I should note that this is a very [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=243.56s)]
*  highly overworked workforce that [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=246.68s)]
*  works six days a week. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=249.68s)]
*  So adding to that, they would need [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=251.64s)]
*  to respond to this of what they [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=253.12s)]
*  did last week. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=254.48s)]
*  Also, these are critical employees [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=255.52s)]
*  that are severely understaffed as [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=258.44s)]
*  well. So they will need to be [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=260.16s)]
*  responding to this email. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=261.52000000000004s)]
*  Secretary Duffy said that the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=263.0s)]
*  Department of Transportation must [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=264.56s)]
*  comply with this email from the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=266.76000000000005s)]
*  OPM, the request of Musk and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZMh1MC2TE&t=269.12s)]
