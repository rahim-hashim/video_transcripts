# February's job growth falls below predictions
**CBS News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM)
*  The U.S. job growth was weaker than expected in February, although still strong, according [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=0.0s)]
*  to the Labor Department's first jobs report of the second Trump administration. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=4.4s)]
*  One hundred and fifty-one thousand jobs were added last month, falling below economist [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=8.52s)]
*  predictions of one hundred and sixty thousand. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=12.92s)]
*  The unemployment rate ticked up to four point one percent. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=15.18s)]
*  CBS News Money Watch correspondent Kelly O'Grady is here with us in Studio 57. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=17.6s)]
*  So are these job numbers a good sign for the president? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=22.64s)]
*  So I think it's relatively positive. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=25.64s)]
*  We are seeing a slowing in the labor market, but we're not falling off a cliff. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=27.759999999999998s)]
*  Four percent or four point one percent unemployment is still very strong. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  We did add ten thousand manufacturing jobs where we had seen that sector losing over [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=35.96s)]
*  the past couple of months. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=41.12s)]
*  I think what you need to think about, though, is what comes next over the next few months. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=42.4s)]
*  We do have concerns about how tariffs will impact consumer spending. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=46.96s)]
*  We're already seeing consumer sentiment take a hit. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=51.04s)]
*  And so if you start to see that impact to companies' sales and revenue, maybe that's [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=53.96s)]
*  when they say, I'm not going to hire as much. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=58.16s)]
*  And you said the next few months, I mean, the Trump administration has fired tens of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=60.44s)]
*  thousands of government workers. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=63.16s)]
*  Does this report reflect that or are you going to be looking for that in future reports? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=66.16s)]
*  Future reports. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=70.12s)]
*  So the majority of that impact is going to be in March and April. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=71.12s)]
*  We got a little bit of it this month, but really we're looking for the next few. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=74.16s)]
*  And President Trump threatened a new round of tariffs on Canadian lumber and dairy Friday. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=78.44s)]
*  How significant is that? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=82.96s)]
*  Could we feel an impact? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  How quickly? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=85.6s)]
*  OK, so with dairy, not so much. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=86.6s)]
*  We actually don't get a ton of dairy from Canada. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=89.24s)]
*  We are a majority exporter of dairy products. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  Lumber, though, that's really where you could see some pain when it comes to prices. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  Think about all of the different natural disasters that have happened. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  We need a lot of homes built and we already needed a lot of homes built already. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  And the National Association of Home Builders has been really warning against a tariff on [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=108.24s)]
*  lumber because that's such a necessary product. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  Why is the president threatening that? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=114.68s)]
*  So lumber and dairy, he's saying, well, Canada tariffs us. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=116.76s)]
*  He's saying this is a reciprocal tariff. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=120.92s)]
*  They don't really do that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  They actually just subsidize their domestic industries to make that more attractive versus [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=123.6s)]
*  the U.S. being able to sell there. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=128.52s)]
*  OK, so as we mentioned earlier, President Trump signed an executive order establishing [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=130.4s)]
*  a strategic Bitcoin reserve. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=133.68s)]
*  How will this work and will taxpayer dollars be used to build up that reserve? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=136.96s)]
*  So this was a big promise of the campaign. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=140.67999999999998s)]
*  A lot of folks in the crypto industry are very excited about this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=142.48s)]
*  We hold a number of different things in reserve like gold, oil, cheese, which is an interesting [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=145.39999999999998s)]
*  one. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=151.44s)]
*  We talked about that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=152.44s)]
*  Yes, we did. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=153.44s)]
*  I love cheese. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=154.44s)]
*  I'll say it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=155.44s)]
*  We both do. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=156.44s)]
*  Let's go to Missouri. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=157.44s)]
*  We'll do it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=158.44s)]
*  But they will hold Bitcoin just as just the same. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=159.44s)]
*  It's there for an emergency. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=162.16s)]
*  Whether they will use taxpayer dollars? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=163.83999999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=165.92s)]
*  This is actually where crypto folks were excited about the U.S. purchasing more Bitcoin. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  That's actually why you saw the price of Bitcoin drop because the U.S. will not be using taxpayer [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  dollars. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=176.48s)]
*  They will just take the current Bitcoin that has been seized from fraudulent activities [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=177.48s)]
*  and use that as a reserve. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  Kelly O'Grady, thank you. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWF6p0HFoM&t=182.95999999999998s)]
