# Justice Department tells prosecutors to drop NYC Mayor Eric Adams' corruption case
**CBS News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA)
*  The Justice Department has ordered prosecutors to drop the federal corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=0.0s)]
*  He's currently facing five charges, including bribery and fraud. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=7.32s)]
*  A memo on the decision claims the case was politically motivated and was also interfering with Adams ability to help with President Trump's immigration crackdown. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=11.76s)]
*  To help us understand this decision, I'm joined by Anna Schechter. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=21.56s)]
*  She's the senior coordinating producer for the CBS News Crime and Public Safety Unit. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=24.16s)]
*  Anna, some of our viewers maybe have a bit of whiplash. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=28.2s)]
*  You and I were together when these charges dropped. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=31.52s)]
*  It was breaking news coverage. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=33.56s)]
*  We were going through these seemingly detailed documents about these allegations against the mayor. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=34.76s)]
*  So how do we get to this Justice Department saying, actually, these charges don't make sense? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=39.68s)]
*  Well, Errol, it's like so many things with the Trump administration this time around, as well as his last term. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=46.04s)]
*  So many unusual things, almost unprecedented. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  You don't generally see a memorandum like this coming out of a Justice Department giving a justification. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=55.24s)]
*  We're going to argue to drop these charges because it's inhibiting a sitting mayor who's facing bribery charges, corruption charges, from carrying out Trump's plan to crackdown on illegal immigration and deport as many illegal migrants as possible. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=62.2s)]
*  It's just so unusual. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=81.36s)]
*  We heard rumblings that the Department of Justice was considering this about a week ago. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=83.12s)]
*  We know Mayor Eric Adams went down to Mar-a-Lago and met with President Trump down in Florida, attended his inauguration. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=89.12s)]
*  And so it seems like he's been courting favor with President Trump. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=97.32s)]
*  And now the Department of Justice is stepping in, showing that it has Mayor Adams back and it's a demand to drop the charges. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  Damian Williams, who was the Southern District of New York prosecutor, he's now out of office. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=110.72s)]
*  He brought those charges. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=114.92s)]
*  We were pouring through dozens of pages of an elaborate story that the prosecutor told of bribes, free flight upgrades, five-star hotels in Istanbul and elsewhere around the world, accepting illegal campaign donations from foreign governments and even pushing through a Turkish consulate in New York City that had not gone through the proper approach. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=116.28s)]
*  The approval process. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=140.28s)]
*  So all of this is this is the fabric of the story that we're dealing with. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=141.68s)]
*  And the memo, as you just pointed out, says these charges interfere with the mayor's ability to help Trump crackdown on immigration. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=147.16s)]
*  It's not saying that these charges are false necessarily. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=154.84s)]
*  And what have we heard from the mayor on this? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=158.36s)]
*  Well, the mayor himself has not come out publicly and made a statement, but he has maintained his innocence. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=160.4s)]
*  But Alex Spiro, his outspoken New York City lawyer, has put out a statement saying from the beginning, we said that these were false charges, that he's completely innocent and that he would be vindicated. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=166.56s)]
*  And now that has occurred. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=179.68s)]
*  But the memorandum does leave some wiggle room. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=181.72s)]
*  It's demanding that the Southern District drop the charges for now without prejudice. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=184.92s)]
*  So that doesn't mean that maybe after the mayoral election in November 2025, the Department of Justice can revisit this. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=190.8s)]
*  So, you know, it still leaves a little bit of wiggle room. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  So what would you expect to happen next? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=201.68s)]
*  As you say, it's kind of unprecedented. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=204.08s)]
*  But what should we be watching for now? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=206.0s)]
*  Well, now we're going to wait and see what the acting prosecutor for the Southern District of New York does. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=208.04000000000002s)]
*  Trump, of course, is going to appoint somebody to take over that role, and it will be up to that person who will be a Trump ally. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=214.55999999999997s)]
*  I expect we'll carry this out. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  We'll drop all the charges. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  We're going to see a mayoral election in November 2025. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=225.88s)]
*  And then after the election, let's see what happens. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=230.2s)]
*  Mayor Adam could win reelection, but a lot of New Yorkers, there's a lot of consternation among New Yorkers who are upset about this kind of sort of disregard for the rule of law. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  As some of my sources have called it, they're opponents of Mayor Adams. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=243.76s)]
*  So we'll have to wait and see. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  Anna Shekler, great to have you on this. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=248.76s)]
*  Just never know what to expect. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=250.64s)]
*  That's right. Great to have you with us. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUVIbZ6WjeA&t=252.2s)]
