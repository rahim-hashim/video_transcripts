# Trump allows immigration officials to revoke legal status of some migrants
**CBS News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg)
*  The White House says President Trump's promised mass deportation operation is now underway. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=0.0s)]
*  White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt posted these photos on X, saying, quote, deportation [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  flights have begun. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=10.22s)]
*  The images show a line of men all in handcuffs being walked onto a military plane. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=11.92s)]
*  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, says that arrested more than 500 undocumented [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=16.06s)]
*  immigrants who were in the country illegally on Thursday. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=21.16s)]
*  CBS News immigration and politics reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez joins me now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=24.32s)]
*  Camilo, you also have new reporting about the Trump administration giving authorities [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=28.28s)]
*  permission to revoke some migrants' legal status. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=32.52s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=35.44s)]
*  That's right, Lindsay. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=36.44s)]
*  For context, under the Biden administration, the U.S. offered hundreds of thousands of [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=37.82s)]
*  immigrants a chance to come here legally under temporary programs that were designed to reduce [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=42.92s)]
*  illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  The Biden administration's argument at the time, Lindsay, was that if you offered would-be [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=52.6s)]
*  migrants legal channels to come to the U.S., they would take those channels and wait for [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=56.699999999999996s)]
*  that opportunity instead of crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally and potentially risking their [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=61.9s)]
*  lives. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=67.94s)]
*  But now the Trump administration is moving very quickly to terminate those programs and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=68.94s)]
*  now has issued guidance, we have learned, to U.S. Customs and Border Protection and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=73.3s)]
*  other federal agencies that will allow them to target these migrants who technically are [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=77.97999999999999s)]
*  here legally for deportation. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=83.06s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=85.34s)]
*  These migrants could face deportation, but also they could face a lapse in their status [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=86.54s)]
*  that will make them undocumented and will create an unlawful presence for them here [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=92.58s)]
*  in the U.S. and make them deportable. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=97.54s)]
*  So it is a pretty seismic shift in policy, and it could affect as many as 1.5 million [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  migrants who were able to come here under these legal immigration programs. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=105.42s)]
*  They include that phone app that the Biden administration set up to allow people in Mexico [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=109.38s)]
*  to be processed in an orderly and legal way at the border, and then also another initiative [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=114.14s)]
*  that allowed people from Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti, and Nicaragua, Lindsay, to come here [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=118.94s)]
*  if they had American sponsors. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=123.58s)]
*  Camila, what can you tell us about these repatriation flights? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=124.98s)]
*  Well, we know the Trump administration is promising, of course, to carry out the largest [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=128.22s)]
*  deportation operation in American history. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=133.38s)]
*  They have been deporting hundreds of people per week, which is not out of the ordinary [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=137.34s)]
*  compared to what the Biden administration was doing when it was in power. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=142.26s)]
*  It was also deporting hundreds of people per week, mostly at the U.S.-Mexico border. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=146.06s)]
*  But obviously, these deportations are now highly visible, and they are also now using [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=150.78s)]
*  Department of Defense military aircraft to carry out some of these deportations. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=156.34s)]
*  We saw two military flights to the country of Guatemala, deporting people from those [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=160.02s)]
*  countries, that country, rather, who were crossing into the U.S. illegally. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=165.38s)]
*  So it is a show forced by the Trump administration, and they are sharing these striking images [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=169.42s)]
*  to highlight that they are starting aggressively on this immigration crackdown. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=173.64s)]
*  Lindsay. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=177.89999999999998s)]
*  There was also a raid in Newark, New Jersey that Mayor Ros Baraka has condemned. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=178.89999999999998s)]
*  What can you tell us about that? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=182.17999999999998s)]
*  Well, local officials in Newark, New Jersey are saying that yesterday, U.S. Immigration [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=183.57999999999998s)]
*  and Customs Enforcement ICE raided a local establishment and arrested undocumented immigrants [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=187.88s)]
*  who are working there, but that they also questioned and briefly detained U.S. citizens, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=193.85999999999999s)]
*  including a U.S. military veteran. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=198.42s)]
*  We know that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did confirm that it conducted [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=200.42s)]
*  an enforcement operation there, Lindsay, but that it did not detain the U.S. citizens. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=204.66s)]
*  Instead, it asked them to verify their U.S. citizenship. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=209.5s)]
*  But still, it is a striking news out of Newark, because now U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=213.14s)]
*  has the power to arrest people who are not the targets of these operations, but who are [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=219.54s)]
*  also in the country illegally. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=224.01999999999998s)]
*  And we have heard from Tom Homan, the new borders are that these so-called collateral [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=226.14000000000001s)]
*  arrests have already occurred of non-criminal migrants who happen to be in these locations [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=230.22s)]
*  when ICE raided the locations. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=235.18s)]
*  Camilo Montoya-Galvez, thank you. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=238.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uABU8vt4OHg&t=241.62s)]
