# Child patient, two doctors among those onboard plane that crashed in Philadelphia
**CBS News:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc)
*  We're getting information from all over the country right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=0.0s)]
*  We want to go to aviation expert and CBS correspondent Chris Van Cleave. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=2.72s)]
*  Chris, on the national end, what have you heard about this incident that happened here [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=6.76s)]
*  in Philadelphia? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=10.16s)]
*  Well, we know the president has been briefed. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=11.16s)]
*  We know that the secretary of transportation is tracking this. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=13.6s)]
*  He has tweeted that there were six people on board. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=18.2s)]
*  We understand that to be the two pilots, two medical professionals, a pediatric patient [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=22.36s)]
*  and likely a relative of that patient. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=27.96s)]
*  We know the NTSB is almost assuredly going to investigate this accident. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=31.12s)]
*  They investigate any fatal aviation accident. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=39.92s)]
*  So we expect they will be sending investigators to the scene. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  And one of the things that they'll work to determine the Lear 55 is an older airplane. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=47.8s)]
*  It may or may not be equipped with the black boxes that we think of when we think of an [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=55.12s)]
*  aviation crash. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=60.4s)]
*  Many Lear jets do have some data recorder. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=61.4s)]
*  They'll look to try to determine if they can locate that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=65.6s)]
*  Obviously, something went horrifically wrong shortly after this plane took off. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=68.96s)]
*  Chris, if there is no black box, that will, I would assume, hamper this investigation [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=74.44s)]
*  a great deal. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=80.2s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=81.2s)]
*  Well, certainly the more data an investigator can have, the better. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=82.28s)]
*  But they have been able to investigate accidents in aircraft that don't have data recorders [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=88.44s)]
*  or don't have voice recorders. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  There will be evidence amongst the wreckage that will be able to help guide them in what [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=96.84s)]
*  may have happened. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=103.88s)]
*  At the very least, what they'll be able to start doing is understanding what did not [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=104.88s)]
*  go wrong. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=110.08s)]
*  It's clear the jet had power, so they'll be able to look at what's left of the engines [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  and likely determine whether they were operating at the point of impact. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=118.56s)]
*  So, yes, you can solve an investigation even if there are not data recorders, a black box, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=121.72s)]
*  a voice recorder. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=131.48s)]
*  Chris, what do you make of the fact that this plane went down at the angle that it did? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=132.48s)]
*  The video that we've been showing shows it going nose diving essentially at a 45 degree [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=138.04s)]
*  angle. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=142.68s)]
*  The fact that it went down so quickly after takeoff. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=143.68s)]
*  Well, I'd be speculating as to what happened after takeoff. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=147.44s)]
*  It certainly appeared to be a situation where the pilots were not in control of the airplane. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=153.0s)]
*  So what could cause a situation like that? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=160.12s)]
*  We'll want to know if the airplane stalled. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=166.6s)]
*  Did something happen on the flight deck to one of the pilots? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=169.12s)]
*  There have been a medical emergency. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=175.64s)]
*  There's all kinds of things that could have gone wrong. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=177.24s)]
*  It appears clear for the plane to come out of the sky like a missile like that, that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=180.44s)]
*  something led to a loss of control, a loss of normal flight. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=186.44s)]
*  So you're in professional opinion this could be a very, very long investigation. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=190.0s)]
*  NTSB investigations typically last about a year. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  Generally speaking, answers come, but they don't come quickly and everybody wants to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  know right now. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=204.56s)]
*  That's one of the frustrating parts for people I think when they're waiting for an NTSB investigation [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=205.56s)]
*  is that they'll tell you what they see fairly quickly when they get on scene like we're [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=211.39999999999998s)]
*  seeing playing out here in Washington D.C. right now. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=218.44s)]
*  They'll tell us what they know. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=221.04s)]
*  They're not going to know a lot right away. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=222.48s)]
*  And then it'll be 30 days or so and then we'll get a preliminary report. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=225.2s)]
*  That'll be a statement of fact. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=229.72s)]
*  That'll be what they know at that point. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=230.72s)]
*  We'll draw no conclusion. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=232.11999999999998s)]
*  And then the final conclusions won't be drawn until that report is done. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  That typically is a year. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  And what complicates this, Chris, is the fact that this accident occurred in a very densely [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  populated area of the Northeast Philadelphia community there. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=246.0s)]
*  And there is quite a wide debris field as well. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=251.23999999999998s)]
*  So that's something else that investigators will be dealing with as they start collecting [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=254.76s)]
*  evidence and collecting the debris. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=260.0s)]
*  The NTSB is very good at what they do. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=262.2s)]
*  So I think what is most remarkable when you look at where this plane came down and the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=265.44s)]
*  way it came down and the amount, the size of the explosion we saw related to this plane, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=269.48s)]
*  there's a lot of fuel on board clearly, is that it came down largely it appears in a [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=275.15999999999997s)]
*  street. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=281.24s)]
*  Think about if that's a row of row homes, if that's an apartment building, we are talking [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=282.56s)]
*  about a much different tragedy. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=287.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=290.36s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=291.36s)]
*  Chris, stand by real quick as I just want to review with our viewers that six people, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=292.36s)]
*  as you mentioned, were on the plane, six people, two pilots, a child patient and a family member. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=297.72s)]
*  And we've just confirmed that juvenile patient finished treatment in Philadelphia and was [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=302.68s)]
*  going to be transported back to Mexico. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=307.58s)]
*  I just wanted to pass that on. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1oFcWRSIc&t=310.04s)]
