# Pete Buttigieg is "taking a serious look" at 2026 Michigan Senate race
**CBS News:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60)
*  I haven't made any decisions about my future except that I'm going to be spending a lot [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=0.0s)]
*  more time with Chastin and the kids. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=4.4s)]
*  There's lots of possibilities. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=6.42s)]
*  People have lots of ideas. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=7.8s)]
*  That was former Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Presidential Hopeful and Transportation Secretary [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=11.14s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg last month who says he's taking a serious look now at running for the United [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=15.620000000000001s)]
*  States Senate in his new home state of Michigan. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=21.0s)]
*  Buttigieg is, quote, exploring all his options. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=24.78s)]
*  According to a source close to him, a seat opened up today in the battleground state [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=26.92s)]
*  after Democratic Senator Gary Peters announced he wouldn't seek re-election in 2026. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  Nicole Killian joins us now from Capitol Hill. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=36.6s)]
*  She's among those who has to track people like Gary Peters and the possibility of a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=38.92s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg campaign. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  So Nicole, let's walk through this. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  What challenges could the former mayor and transportation secretary face should he decide [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=46.78s)]
*  to jump into this race? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=51.2s)]
*  Well, if anything, obviously, he does not necessarily have roots in Michigan, although [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=53.6s)]
*  his husband lives there. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=59.36s)]
*  And so from that standpoint, obviously, many know him as the former mayor of South Bend, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=61.72s)]
*  Indiana. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=66.0s)]
*  So, you know, in terms of just from a geographic standpoint, while yes, that's close to Michigan, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=67.0s)]
*  it could raise some questions or eyebrows. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=72.08s)]
*  But that being said, as long as he is a resident of the state and lives there ahead of this [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=74.68s)]
*  run, it's certainly possible for him to run. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=79.24s)]
*  But I think if anything, you know, it depends on who else potentially might get into this [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=82.60000000000001s)]
*  race. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=86.04s)]
*  Obviously, it could be a wide open field. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=87.04s)]
*  We saw a lot of competition, certainly for the seat that was vacated by Debbie Stabenow. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  So unclear at this point who else may jump in. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=95.4s)]
*  Governor Gretchen Whitmer, as of now, has ruled out a potential run, but there are certainly [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=98.12s)]
*  many other potential possibilities. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=103.4s)]
*  And of course, also, it depends who gets in on the Republican side as well. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  There's been some talk potentially of Congressman John James, who may potentially be interested [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=109.48s)]
*  in the seat. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=115.68s)]
*  So there are a lot of options and possibilities. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=116.68s)]
*  Still, this race is a long way out, but already getting started, as Gary Peters announced [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  that he would no longer seek re-election. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  That'll be one to watch, and it will get crowded on the Democratic side for sure. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  Let's head down to Georgia, where the NRSC, or the organization that recruits Republicans [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=130.44s)]
*  to run for the Senate, is now courting the Georgia governor, Brian Kemp, to run for the Senate [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  there in 2026 against the Democratic Senator John Oshoff. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=140.6s)]
*  Why would Republicans want Governor Kemp to run, especially given his colored past with [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=143.82s)]
*  President Trump? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=149.72s)]
*  Well, they want to flip the seat, plain and simple. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=150.72s)]
*  And certainly we saw President Trump flip the state of Georgia, of course, after President [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=153.92s)]
*  Biden won the state after some three decades. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=158.48s)]
*  And of course, that ultimately led, that kind of momentum led to people like John Oshoff [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=161.6s)]
*  and Senator Warnock being elected from the state of Georgia. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=167.0s)]
*  But there's certainly a sentiment there in the Peach State that Georgia is still a red [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=169.72s)]
*  state and so many Republicans in that state would like to see it flip back. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  Not to mention that Governor Kemp, of course, is quite popular in the state and has a pretty [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  strong track record among constituents there. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=182.28s)]
*  So he is certainly a target and somebody who has been talked about for some time now about [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  a potential Senate run. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=191.0s)]
*  But certainly now that Tim Scott is in charge, this is the time to be plotting strategy and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=193.0s)]
*  recruiting candidates, because again, 2026 is just around the corner. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=198.67999999999998s)]
*  And it takes a lot of money. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  Real quick, there are a pair of special primaries today in Florida to replace now former Congressman [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=204.83999999999997s)]
*  Matt Gaetz, who of course quit Congress, and Mike Waltz, who's now the national security [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  advisor. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=214.48s)]
*  What are we looking for in those races? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=215.48s)]
*  Well, basically, we just want to see who ultimately ends up succeeding these members of Congress, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=217.04s)]
*  of course. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=221.44s)]
*  So we saw Matt Gaetz resign from his position amid some controversy, of course, as he was [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=222.44s)]
*  briefly named as Attorney General Dominey for President Trump only to withdraw a couple [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  of days later, of course, when he was named to that post ever so briefly, he then resigned [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=232.83999999999997s)]
*  from his seat. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  And of course, that was pending a congressional ethics investigation as well. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  So this is a very crowded field in terms of his particular race in the first congressional [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=243.72s)]
*  district down there in Florida in the Penn Handle. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=248.22s)]
*  In fact, one of his former opponents, Aaron Dimmick, is one of those running. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=250.84s)]
*  But right now, the favorite candidate appears to be Jimmy Petronas, who has been endorsed [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=255.79999999999998s)]
*  not only by Gaetz, but also President Trump. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=259.88s)]
*  There is also a special election happening down in Florida to replace Congressman Mike [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=262.4s)]
*  Waltz, who as you know, has been tapped to head up the national security team for President [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=266.8s)]
*  Trump as one of his top advisors. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=272.14s)]
*  So we will see who fill those slots. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  But certainly they will be critical to keep in Republican hands since we know the majority [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=276.44s)]
*  will be quite narrow in the House. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=280.76s)]
*  So if anything, that's probably what Speaker Johnson is watching for going forward. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=282.72s)]
*  Our executive producer, Ali Sanz, had me look this up, Nicole. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=287.76s)]
*  643 days left until election night 2026. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=291.32s)]
*  For those of you keeping score at home. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=297.2s)]
*  Nicole, thank you as always. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=298.72s)]
*  Well, we know you've got your whiteboard, Ed. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  We'll bring it out. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30oiOo3gZ60&t=301.96000000000004s)]
