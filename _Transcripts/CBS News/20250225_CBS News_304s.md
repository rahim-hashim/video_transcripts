# Confusion over Musk's threat to federal employees who don't reply to OPM email
**CBS News:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic)
*  The future of federal workers hangs in the balance as agency managers square up with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=0.0s)]
*  Doge Leader Elon Musk. Employees got an email from the White House over the weekend asking [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=4.24s)]
*  them to reply with five examples of work they did in the past week. If they failed to respond, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=9.44s)]
*  those workers would be fired. The deadline to submit that response was last night at 1159 p.m [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  eastern, but Musk seemingly had a change of heart. He posted this to his ex account ahead of the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=21.36s)]
*  midnight cutoff. Subject to the discretion of the president, they will be given another chance. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=28.08s)]
*  Failure to respond a second time will result in termination. Musk also slammed federal workers [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  and their managers last night saying, quote, the email request was utterly trivial as the standard [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=39.28s)]
*  for passing the test was to type some words and press send. Yet so many failed even that inane [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=44.72s)]
*  test urged on in some cases by their managers. Have you ever witnessed such incompetence and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=50.56s)]
*  contempt for how your taxes are being spent? Now, those agencies have new guidance from the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=55.92s)]
*  White House and how to respond to those emails. The Office of Personnel Management released a [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  memo outlining changes to the initial directive from the president. That memo said in part, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=66.64s)]
*  quote, agencies should consider any appropriate actions regarding employees and fail who fail [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=72.56s)]
*  rather to respond to activity and accomplishment requests. It is agency leadership's decision [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=79.04s)]
*  as to what actions are taken. It also seems to exempt Trump White House staffers from sending [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=84.72s)]
*  those emails. At least five agencies pushed back on the original memo and told employees to ignore [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=91.12s)]
*  the request. Those agencies include the FBI, the American Federation of Government Employees, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=97.28s)]
*  the State Department, the Department of Defense and the Office of the Director of National [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=103.28s)]
*  Intelligence. CBS News Senior White House correspondent Weijia Zhang joins us now for more. Weijia, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=108.72s)]
*  thank you for joining us today. What else stood out to you in this memo and who should employees [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=114.0s)]
*  listen to at this point? Omuga, that is the question because what stands out from the memo [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=119.6s)]
*  is that it doesn't match what Elon Musk said in his post on X, which of course said you have [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=126.48s)]
*  another chance and if you don't respond, then you know you will be forced to resign and lose your job. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=133.2s)]
*  But that is not what the Office of Personnel Management said and they are essentially [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=139.12s)]
*  the HR department for the federal government. We just heard you lay it out and they said it's up [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=143.52s)]
*  to the agency heads to determine whether or not these employees have to respond and whether or [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=148.88s)]
*  not some should be given an exemption to basically use their discretion. And so the question that is [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=154.8s)]
*  outstanding is how much power does Elon Musk really have? I mean President Trump has been [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=160.4s)]
*  empowering him at every one of these twists and turns calling his idea to make people justify [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=165.12s)]
*  their work in writing ingenious and he says he backs this idea of having to write down your [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  five accomplishments. But that doesn't mean a federal judge would agree if you took it to court [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  because as an example, OPM, this HR agency, did not send a memo to federal workers that also said [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=182.64s)]
*  you have another chance, you have more time essentially to fill this out like Elon said on [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=190.72s)]
*  X. So if a federal worker doesn't have social media, what are they supposed to do? They would [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=196.48s)]
*  not have received that message from Musk and so there are so many questions for the White House [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=201.76s)]
*  about your very question, which is who are people supposed to listen to? There's so much mass confusion [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=206.16s)]
*  about all of this, Mugo. Yeah confusion, the key word here. And I want to ask you a different [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=211.92s)]
*  question here. This is about the IRS. The acting commissioner may step down over disagreements [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=216.72s)]
*  about doge access to sensitive data. What more can you tell us about that? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=222.4s)]
*  Well, I want to be really careful not to conflate these two things because Doug O'Donnell, the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=228.0s)]
*  current acting chief of the IRS, he was going to step down anyway. He was a career staffer who [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=232.72s)]
*  had been there for four decades. He only stepped in because President Biden's appointee resigned [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=239.6s)]
*  on the first day of the Trump administration. And then the person that President Trump picked [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=246.48s)]
*  to fill that spot, former congressman from Missouri, Billy Long, has not had his Senate [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=252.23999999999998s)]
*  confirmation hearing yet. And so that was always going to happen. At some point, it just hasn't [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=259.03999999999996s)]
*  been prioritized by the Senate to get him confirmed. So we don't know exactly why the acting person who [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=263.92s)]
*  is Doug O'Donnell is stepping down. But you're right in that there has been a lot of chaos out [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=271.2s)]
*  of that department. Some 6,500 workers were fired and a lot of questions remain about [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=277.2s)]
*  Doge's attempt to access workers' personal information. All of that was sort of happening [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=282.56s)]
*  at the same time as O'Donnell announcing or expected to announce that he's going to step down. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=287.84s)]
*  But again, we don't want to say that one thing led to another when he was going to step down anyway. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  Right. Okay, Wujia Cheng, thank you so much for the context on that and for joining us on the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=298.24s)]
*  stream today. Appreciate your time. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFaMRgm7ic&t=302.08s)]
