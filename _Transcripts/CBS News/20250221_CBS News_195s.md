# What to know about failed Hamas return of Shiri Bibas' body, bus explosions in Israel
**CBS News:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms)
*  So we begin with two big developments out of the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=0.0s)]
*  Late last night, several buses exploded in what appeared to be a coordinated attack. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=4.8s)]
*  And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now vowing to make Hamas pay for failing [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=10.46s)]
*  to return the body of a deceased Israeli hostage. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=15.96s)]
*  You may remember yesterday, the militant group handed over the bodies of four hostages, said [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=19.92s)]
*  to be Shiri Bebas and her two young children, Ariel and Kefir, as well as Oded Lifshitz. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=25.44s)]
*  But overnight, Israel's defense forces announced one of the bodies received was not that of [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=32.28s)]
*  the mother. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=37.400000000000006s)]
*  These Hamas monsters also cynically refused to bring back the boy's mother, Shiri, and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  sent the body of a Gaza woman instead in brazen violation of the agreement. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=44.52s)]
*  Joining us now for more on this from Jerusalem is CBS News foreign correspondent Deborah [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  Deborah. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=55.92s)]
*  I cannot imagine what this is like for the relatives of the victims. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=56.92s)]
*  But how is Hamas responding to this mix up? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=61.12s)]
*  And tell us more about the fallout. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=64.72s)]
*  Well certainly it's prolonging the agony of the family of Shiri Bebas and her two children. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=69.0s)]
*  Hamas has said it remains committed to the deal and will be releasing six hostages as [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=75.6s)]
*  planned tomorrow. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=81.08s)]
*  They say they're going to investigate what happened with Shiri Bebas's body but point [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=82.72s)]
*  out it could have been mixed up with other human remains found in the rubble after an [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=87.16s)]
*  Israeli strike. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=93.2s)]
*  But the fallout is continuing here. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=94.92s)]
*  Right-wing members of Prime Minister Netanyahu's ruling coalition have seized the opportunity [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=97.52s)]
*  to push the view that the war should restart. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=102.44s)]
*  But then you have the community of near Oz, the kibbutz that the Bebas family were part [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=105.24s)]
*  of calling for release, not revenge and urging the government to bring Shiri Bebas's body [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=110.84s)]
*  back in a way that does not jeopardize the continuation of the ceasefire and the release [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=118.56s)]
*  of all the hostages. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=124.74s)]
*  Negotiations for that second phase have not yet taken place, Errol, even though this first [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=127.44s)]
*  stage ends in just over a week. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=132.32s)]
*  And this surprising development, Deborah, comes after a series of bus explosions last [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=134.94s)]
*  night near Tel Aviv. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=139.92s)]
*  Those buses were not occupied. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=141.64s)]
*  But what do we know about what happened? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=143.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, exactly, Errol. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=145.72s)]
*  As the country was still grieving over the return of those four bodies, there were those [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=148.92s)]
*  series of explosions on at least three buses in central Israel. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  Now police say the bombs were all identical and equipped with timers, but that there were [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=159.48s)]
*  no injuries. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=164.88s)]
*  But since then, the process of getting to the bottom of this has become very murky. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=166.88s)]
*  Unusually, nobody has claimed responsibility for the blast. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=170.04s)]
*  Israeli media is reporting that two Israeli suspects have been arrested. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=174.04s)]
*  But then a court issued gag order prevents the publication of any more details on that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=178.44s)]
*  investigation and also any information that could reveal the identity of the suspects. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=184.56s)]
*  All right, Deb Pada, with all the latest for us out of Jerusalem. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=190.32s)]
*  Deborah, thank you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoDsJ1p5ms&t=193.48s)]
