# Crews remove first pieces of plane crash wreckage from Potomac River
**CBS News:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU)
*  Crews have removed the first pieces of wreckage from the American Airlines plane that collided midair [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=0.0s)]
*  with a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter near Washington last week. The plane's fuselage [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  and main body were pulled from the Potomac River Monday. DC fire officials say 55 sets of remains [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=9.36s)]
*  have been identified. All 64 people aboard the passenger jet died in Wednesday's crash, as did [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=16.16s)]
*  the three soldiers on the helicopter. It's the deadliest air accident in the U.S. in more than [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=21.92s)]
*  Joining us now is CBS News senior transportation correspondent Chris Van Cleave. Chris, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=27.52s)]
*  what are investigators hoping to find in the wreckage recovered Monday? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  Well, Lindsay, they're recovering parts of the airplane. Right now the focus is the airliner. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  Right now they want to get all of the pieces of wreckage out of the water, eventually into a [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=41.92s)]
*  hangar so NTSB investigators can come over it. Today they recovered an engine, a portion of the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=47.28s)]
*  fuselage, and one of the wings of the airplane. Tomorrow they're going to focus on getting the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=53.04s)]
*  cockpit, the front part of the airplane. The plane appears to have broken into roughly three [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=57.6s)]
*  pieces when it came down. I don't know, every time we get more details it's just it's hard to think [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=61.84s)]
*  about that, knowing that that plane was carrying so many people. You asked Army officials Monday [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=67.92s)]
*  whether there was a specific reason as to why the Black Hawk helicopter involved may have been [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=72.8s)]
*  flying higher than permitted. What do they say? Yeah, you know, prefaced with it's too early to [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=77.12s)]
*  speculate, the Army colonel is the deputy director of our Army aviation, Mark Ott. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  Colonel Ott said that there are many reasons why one could deviate from an altitude, avoiding an [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=91.28s)]
*  obstacle, a flock of birds were examples he gave. You know, ultimately when the causes of this crash [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=96.72s)]
*  come together, it will be plural. There will be a chain of events that led to disaster. Certainly [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=104.64s)]
*  two aircraft shouldn't be, even if that helicopter had been at 200 feet, 125 feet of separation [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  isn't enough. So it would have been a problem regardless. What allowed those two aircraft to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=120.56s)]
*  end up so close together is going to be one of the factors in how this turned so tragic. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=125.92s)]
*  What's next in the process? What are you watching for in the coming days? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=132.48s)]
*  Well, you know, it's really about the wreckage removal out on the water and then as the NTSB is [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=137.12s)]
*  able to analyze the data from the black boxes on board the helicopter and on board the airplane, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=142.56s)]
*  synchronize that data over the coming, in some cases, weeks and months, it will give a clearer [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=149.28s)]
*  picture of those moments leading up to the crash. You know, the audio recording, if there is audio [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=156.0s)]
*  recordings from the helicopter, may give us a very good understanding of were they flying with [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=162.4s)]
*  night vision? Did they see the airplane? Were they having any issues that might have caused them to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=166.32s)]
*  need to climb, for example? You know, there are a lot of questions that will be answered, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=171.28s)]
*  but it's just going to take time. Chris Van Cleave, thank you. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0skupAa5BBU&t=176.64s)]
