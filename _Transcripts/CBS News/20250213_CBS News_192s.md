# RFK Jr. on track for confirmation as HHS secretary
**CBS News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A)
*  Tulsi Gabbard was sworn in as Director of National Intelligence. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=0.0s)]
*  She's currently traveling to Germany for the Munich Security Conference we mentioned earlier. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=4.2s)]
*  There she will participate in several bilateral meetings separate from Vice President Vance. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=9.4s)]
*  Later this morning, the Senate is set to hold its final vote on Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=14.6s)]
*  Trump wants him to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  CBS News' Congressional Correspondent Torian Small is following all of this for us from Capitol Hill and joins us now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=24.2s)]
*  Torian, what can we expect from RFK Jr.'s confirmation vote? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=30.0s)]
*  Does he have the support he needs? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=34.0s)]
*  Yeah, Aero simply put, yes he does. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=37.0s)]
*  We were watching for the usual suspects here, Republicans who tend to break from the party when it comes to these more controversial picks. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=39.2s)]
*  And so far, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine have all come out in support of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for the Department of Health and Human Services leader. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=48.2s)]
*  I should also mention that those two, along with Mitch McConnell, broke from the party when it came to the nomination and confirmation of Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defense. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=62.4s)]
*  Their concerns really shared there about the cloud of controversy that surrounded his confirmation. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=76.4s)]
*  But looking forward, it appears that no pick has strong reservations among Republicans that could stop them from getting that confirmation. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=83.0s)]
*  So it appears the rest of Donald Trump's picks are smooth sailing, at least in the Senate. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=94.0s)]
*  And I want to ask you about something that has another direct impact on folks watching the budget. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  The House released its plan yesterday despite a competing proposal from the Senate. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=104.8s)]
*  What is in what the House Republicans are proposing? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=108.8s)]
*  Yeah, House Republicans want to clear away through this blueprint that they released yesterday for $4.5 trillion in spending that would support an extension of Trump's 2017 tax cuts bill. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=113.8s)]
*  What we're seeing there, though, is that they're also looking at cutting around $1.5 trillion in order to offset some of the expenditures there. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=129.60000000000002s)]
*  The main issue that House Republicans are running into, though, is this competing bill in the Senate. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=140.60000000000002s)]
*  Speaker Johnson said that anything that comes out of the Senate chambers, even though they had a jumpstart on these developments, will be a nonstarter because he just can't seem to find 218 members to support that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=145.8s)]
*  He's asking Senate Republicans, especially Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who is the chair of the Budget Committee, to follow their lead first, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  allow them to clear whatever hurdles in the House first to ensure that there's support there in order to avoid an imminent budget battle that could see both bills stymie before the March 14th deadline, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  which again, Errol, is when the government could shut down if a funding package isn't approved. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x62-ax_Ox6A&t=183.6s)]
