# Trump enacting 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, 10% tariff on China
**CBS News:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU)
*  Let's go deeper. Let's bring in CBS News White House digital reporter Aaron Navarro [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=0.0s)]
*  So Caroline just confirmed those terrorists for Canada Mexico and China tomorrow the motive of course trying to stop the flow of deadly fentanyl [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=4.1s)]
*  What did you hear in that? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=11.98s)]
*  Read good to be with you. Yeah [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=15.26s)]
*  Caroline Levitt confirmed that effective tomorrow there will be a 25% tariff on Mexico [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=17.46s)]
*  25% tariff on Canada and President Trump has in the past said that that's because of trade deficits [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=24.060000000000002s)]
*  Between the US and those countries [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=30.0s)]
*  Caroline also announced a 10% tariff on China and she attributed that to fentanyl [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=32.8s)]
*  We have heard Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau say that there will be countermeasures [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=38.28s)]
*  He said that earlier this week to potential tariffs. We'll see how this all plays out [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=42.9s)]
*  We export vehicles and machinery to both of those countries and we import timber [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=48.379999999999995s)]
*  Produce booze from Mexico as well as electronics and appliances from the two countries [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=54.580000000000005s)]
*  So if this tariff war escalates to an extent, that's where we could see a potential impact in terms of prices [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=60.220000000000006s)]
*  Caroline did not specify if there would be any exemption for when it comes to oil [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=68.10000000000001s)]
*  All right, and I did want to ask you about that prior reporting was that oil would not be included [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=73.02000000000001s)]
*  Did you feel like there was a softening and that the oil that comes in and out of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=78.54s)]
*  United States and Canada back and forth over those lines could actually not be subject to tariffs [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=82.26s)]
*  Remains to be seen President Trump even yesterday had two different kinds of answers at first [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=90.82s)]
*  He said that oil is not part of this and then said he would re-examine it later in the night [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=95.42s)]
*  And when asked if oil prices would be [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  impacted at all [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=105.02s)]
*  Potentially rise because of a result of these tariffs Caroline Levitt [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=106.5s)]
*  Appointed to other actions done by the Trump administration when it comes to lowering prices [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=110.14s)]
*  So we will see in 24 hours or less [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=114.61999999999999s)]
*  Now when these tariffs go into effect tomorrow the tariffs and the impacts likely on CBS News 24-7 coming up Monday [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=117.97999999999999s)]
*  We're going to be able to see what the economic impacts will be Aaron Navarro. Always great to talk to you [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHL-4evhKoU&t=125.46s)]
