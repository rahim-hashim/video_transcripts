# Latest weather forecast as California digs through wildfire rubble
**CBS News:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs)
*  Firefighters in Southern California took advantage of lighter winds yesterday and this morning [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=0.0s)]
*  to gain just a bit more control on some of those wildfires that continue to rage as you [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=7.04s)]
*  see from this footage around the greater Los Angeles area. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=12.1s)]
*  Now officials say the Eaton fire is now 45% contained, that's up from 35% yesterday, while [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=15.48s)]
*  the Palisades fire is still only 19% contained. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=21.8s)]
*  The Otto fire, as it's been called, is already 50% contained after igniting Monday night [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  and the Hearst fire you see highlighted on your screen is nearing 100% contained. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=31.08s)]
*  But here's the issue, stronger winds still expected in Southern California today before [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=35.92s)]
*  they weaken slowly overnight and into tomorrow. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=40.84s)]
*  By now, more than 82,000 people remain under mandatory evacuation orders. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=44.62s)]
*  Let's speak with CBS News correspondent Adam Yamaguchi. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  He is close to where the Pacific Palisades fire raged through that neighborhood. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=53.0s)]
*  This is 20 miles west of downtown Los Angeles for those who aren't aware. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=58.6s)]
*  And Adam, I know that this is a city you lived for a long time also and you spoke with fire [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=61.96s)]
*  officials who are giving us a sense of just how challenging this continues to be. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=66.4s)]
*  What are you learning? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=71.12s)]
*  Yeah, well, luckily the worst of the forecasted winds haven't hit with the ferocity that was [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=74.12s)]
*  expected overnight and this morning and into the afternoon. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=81.64s)]
*  But fire officials are quick to warn that we are certainly not yet out of the woods. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=85.08s)]
*  We are still under that particularly dangerous situation designation issued by the Weather [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=89.4s)]
*  Service. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=94.04s)]
*  That's not going to sunset for at least a few more hours. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=95.04s)]
*  So again, they're asking everybody to exercise caution because fires really could flare [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=97.56s)]
*  up at any moment. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=103.56s)]
*  My understanding is they're looking at Friday as possibly being when we can start actually [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  having some repopulation. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=109.58000000000001s)]
*  But obviously, you know, there's a lot of hazards that still need to be mitigated. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=111.44s)]
*  As you drive through this neighborhood behind us, you'll see a lot of streets where there's [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  still trees down. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=116.72s)]
*  There's wires down across the road. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=117.83999999999999s)]
*  You know, we've got many, many crews working right here on sunset. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=120.19999999999999s)]
*  I'm sure as you came in, you saw the utilities are digging holes in the street where they're [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=122.83999999999999s)]
*  actually trying to access these shutoff valves and things that they need to do. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=126.8s)]
*  So there's going to be a lot of activity in this area that's going to be going on before [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=130.32s)]
*  it's going to be safe for people to return. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=134.4s)]
*  And again, while we aren't yet out of the woods, we're certainly seeing sort of a new [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=137.2s)]
*  phase in the cleanup. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=142.72s)]
*  We're seeing a lot more activity on the streets. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=144.72s)]
*  Cleanup crews are here in anticipation of expecting people to come back into their homes [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=146.82s)]
*  into this neighborhood in the next couple days. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=153.2s)]
*  And it's then that we will really truly understand the full magnitude of the loss, the devastating [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=156.22s)]
*  loss that these families are about to see. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=162.12s)]
*  And Adam, I am still stunned to see that footage around you of Los Angeles. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=165.28s)]
*  And as you say, we haven't really absorbed the full magnitude of this yet. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=169.44s)]
*  I'm just wondering from your perspective, what has shocked you the most? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  You know, you run out of words to describe the level and the scope and the breadth of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  the devastation here. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=185.36s)]
*  Walking around, driving around, the devastation is endless. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  And again, this is, you know, this is through the eyes of a journalist covering all of this. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  I don't live in this neighborhood. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=197.76s)]
*  I know many, many people who do live here who've lost it all. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=199.48s)]
*  They haven't seen their homes firsthand, but they just understand that what they are going [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=203.92s)]
*  to be coming back to is going to hit on a level that I don't think any of us is ever [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=207.84s)]
*  prepared for. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=215.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=216.32s)]
*  And as your interview with the fire official laid out, some of those folks may be seeing [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=217.32s)]
*  their destroyed properties for the first time this upcoming weekend. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=220.08s)]
*  Adam Yamaguchi, thank you so much. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=223.36s)]
*  The call to battle these historic fires is being answered by first responders, not only [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=226.84s)]
*  from throughout California, but really from across the country. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=231.68s)]
*  CBS News senior weather correspondent Rob Marciano spoke with some who travel quite [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=235.52s)]
*  a long way to the front lines. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=240.0s)]
*  Driving along the L.A. streets, not yet torched by deadly flames, we saw firefighters from [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=245.16s)]
*  around the country on guard to stop new sparks from gaining traction. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  In the neighborhoods near the Palisades fire that haven't been burned out, firefighters [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=255.12s)]
*  like these guys stand out already. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=258.92s)]
*  They're from Colorado and their engines line these streets strategically to take action [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=260.92s)]
*  if a spark flares. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=265.58s)]
*  We're going to create a buffer around every house in this area that could potentially [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=266.58s)]
*  be threatened if anything would flare up. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  So we're clearing trees. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  We can brush anything around those structures. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=277.47999999999996s)]
*  The county fire department has deployed 5,200 personnel. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  They're warriors. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=284.4s)]
*  They're good. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=285.4s)]
*  But for what is likely the largest natural disaster in L.A. history, every extra hand [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=286.4s)]
*  is needed. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=290.52s)]
*  How valuable are these departments from out of state to you guys? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=291.52s)]
*  Well, yeah, they are very valuable for us as we continue to do this firefight and the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  days get longer and the hours continue. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=299.74s)]
*  Those guys are providing a little bit of relief so we don't have to stretch our guys [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=302.8s)]
*  too thin. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=307.04s)]
*  We're going to stay as long as needed. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=308.04s)]
*  Greg Cates and his unit from Oregon hit the front lines first thing Saturday morning. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=310.52000000000004s)]
*  What does it do for you in here to come from another state and help out? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  The fire service is a brother and sisterhood throughout the world. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  So for us to come down here and assist our brothers and sisters in a time of great tragedy [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=324.2s)]
*  and need, it's an honouring experience. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=329.8s)]
*  It's very humbling. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=331.56s)]
*  It's encouraging to see. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=333.56s)]
*  But get this, more than 10 million people right now are under particularly dangerous [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=334.72s)]
*  situation. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=339.76s)]
*  Those are the exact words, red flag warnings that are in place until 3 p.m. Pacific time. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Grant Gilmore is tracking this angle of the story [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=346.32s)]
*  for us. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=350.32s)]
*  Hey there, Grant. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=351.32s)]
*  Yeah, so today is really the last real dangerous day, if you can call it that, with the combination [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=352.32s)]
*  of the really dry air and those gusty conditions. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=357.6s)]
*  We've got these red flag warnings that will remain in effect for much of Southern California [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=360.68s)]
*  through the rest of the day over on the West Coast. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=364.92s)]
*  But there's this particular concern there. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=368.12s)]
*  I've outlined it there where we've got a particularly dangerous situation with that red flag warning [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=370.36s)]
*  where you've got a combination of those wind gusts 50 to maybe even 70 miles per hour with [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=374.52s)]
*  those low relative humidity values that will stay there in the teens, 12 to 17 percent [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  this afternoon. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=384.12s)]
*  Probably the same thing tomorrow. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=385.44s)]
*  The thing that's different about tomorrow is that the wind speeds or at least those [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=386.44s)]
*  gusts will begin to relax a little bit as then some more moisture and the higher relative [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=389.48s)]
*  humidity will start to build back into the region as we go through Friday afternoon. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=394.4s)]
*  Watch here with the forecast wind gusts as we go through rest of the day today, gusting [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=399.48s)]
*  30 to 40, maybe even up to 60 miles per hour in some places. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=403.44s)]
*  We'll still see some gusty winds early tomorrow morning, but it looks like those wind gusts [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=407.56s)]
*  should begin to decrease pretty quickly as we go through the second half of the day tomorrow. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=412.08s)]
*  In the meantime, we've got cold air in place across the eastern half of the United States, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=417.88s)]
*  a storm system bringing some snow to the Great Lakes up into the northeast as we go into [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=422.08s)]
*  the day tomorrow. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=426.23999999999995s)]
*  But the big story beyond that will be, well, retreating Arctic air right now before a serious [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=427.96s)]
*  blast of even colder air invades the eastern half of, if not the eastern two thirds of [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=433.23999999999995s)]
*  the United States as we head through the early part of next week. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=438.4s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=442.32s)]
*  All right, Grant, thank you for that. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya-UhEYxyrs&t=443.32s)]
