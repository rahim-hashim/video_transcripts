*  At first the Sheriff's Department said there was no signs of any foul play [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcFxsp1q9rs&t=48.9s)]
*  But according to these court documents, we just got this morning. It says their deaths were suspicious enough to warrant a thorough investigation [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcFxsp1q9rs&t=52.96s)]

*  While two of their other dogs they found alive and roaming around the property [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcFxsp1q9rs&t=86.88s)]
*  Do we have any indication yet of how they might died and how investigators are ruling out foul play? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcFxsp1q9rs&t=90.92s)]
*  Or not ruling it out yet. Not quite yet Lindsay [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcFxsp1q9rs&t=97.32s)]
