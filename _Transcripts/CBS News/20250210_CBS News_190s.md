# Judge pauses steep Trump cuts to medical research funding for now
**CBS News:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA)
*  A federal judge has blocked the National Institutes of Health from implementing cuts to medical [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=0.0s)]
*  research grants under the Trump administration. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=5.76s)]
*  That's after 22 states sued to halt the process. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=8.44s)]
*  In a post-Friday, the agency said it planned to limit those funds to 15%. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=11.52s)]
*  Officials noted that $9 billion of the $35 billion given for research in the 2023 fiscal [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=17.0s)]
*  year was used for administrative needs rather than direct research. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=22.34s)]
*  Those funds cover things like lab space, safety equipment, and payroll for support staff. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=26.52s)]
*  President Trump proposed similar budget cuts for the National Institutes of Health during [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  his first administration. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=34.92s)]
*  The move never received congressional support. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=36.64s)]
*  CBS News digital reporter Alex Tin joins us now. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=38.92s)]
*  Alex, thanks for being on the program. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=42.04s)]
*  What can you tell us about this federal ruling and what it means? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=44.4s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's important to remind viewers that this is a temporary pause on the decision. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=47.72s)]
*  It's pending a federal court case that was just filed this morning by those 22 states [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=54.04s)]
*  and is going to a hearing on February 20. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=58.76s)]
*  So we're going to find out in the next couple of weeks whether this is going to be a permanent [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=61.48s)]
*  pause on this policy change or just a temporary short-lived one. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=65.2s)]
*  The other thing that's important to remind people at home is that this is affecting not [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=69.0s)]
*  just future grants. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=72.44s)]
*  The reason these states sued is it's affecting grants right now. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=73.84s)]
*  Research institutions go through these extensive negotiations with federal health officials. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=78.22s)]
*  They undergo inspections where health officials come and they say, what are you really using [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=82.04s)]
*  this equipment for? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=86.04s)]
*  What are you really using this building for? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=87.04s)]
*  And as a result of that, they come up to this negotiated agreement of how much money the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=89.14s)]
*  federal government is going to pay for those so-called administrative costs. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=93.94000000000001s)]
*  Keeping the building up, you know, turning the lights on, paying for the security. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  Changing those overnight without going through those negotiations again is something that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=103.2s)]
*  the states say is not just unfair but illegal. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=107.2s)]
*  And just for some context, when they announced this, you know, it's going from 28% to 15%. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=110.92s)]
*  Some foundations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, they are at that 50% already. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=117.04s)]
*  So just kind of putting that all into context, I do want to ask you, I mean, the Trump administration [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=122.16s)]
*  says these cuts will save more than $4 billion a year. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=126.12s)]
*  You know, how could many medical researchers, how many patients could be affected by this? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=130.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's hard to understate the scale of medical research in the United States [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=135.88s)]
*  that is subsidized at least in part by the NIH. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=141.08s)]
*  As you mentioned, yes, it's true, lots of other foundations contribute money towards [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=144.36s)]
*  medical research in the U.S. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=148.42000000000002s)]
*  Nobody contributes the same amount of money that the NIH does to subsidize those costs. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=150.28s)]
*  You know, again, keeping those labs open, keeping them safe, keeping the doors working [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  and keeping the equipment up and running. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=160.32s)]
*  Obviously, there is a larger conversation here that's been going on for many years, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=162.56s)]
*  calling for cuts to how much the U.S. pays for that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=167.04000000000002s)]
*  But of course, the complaint that you're hearing now, not just from research universities, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=170.28s)]
*  but states, as well as some lawmakers now, is that this isn't the way to make those changes, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  that it's not something that the Trump administration should be able to do unilaterally. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  It's something they say should be up to Congress. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=182.62s)]
*  Certainly an ongoing discussion. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=185.0s)]
*  We will see. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=187.60000000000002s)]
*  Alex Dinn, thank you. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=188.60000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3mZGZqEPA&t=189.60000000000002s)]
