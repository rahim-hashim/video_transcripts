# NYC Mayor Eric Adams' corruption case will continue for now, judge rules
**CBS News:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0)
*  Let's get you to some breaking news because just moments ago a federal judge out of New York City [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0&t=0.0s)]
*  has just paused that request from the Justice Department to dismiss corruption charges against [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0&t=4.48s)]
*  Mayor Eric Adams. Let's get to CBS News Department of Justice reporter Jake Rosen. Jake, what can you [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0&t=9.68s)]
*  tell us about this? Right, so this filing just came across the docket by Judge Dale Ho. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0&t=15.6s)]
*  Judge Ho did not have many options in this case after Monday's hearing in which he heard from both [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0&t=22.88s)]
*  sides, Mayor Adams and the Department of Justice, both in agreement to potentially dismiss this case [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0&t=27.6s)]
*  and that we know that really weeks long of discussions led to that point. However, Judge Ho [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0&t=34.0s)]
*  did one thing in particular today. He has ordered an amicus brief or a friend of the court filing [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0&t=39.36s)]
*  from a former Solicitor General who is going to basically be the public's voice in the room and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0&t=45.2s)]
*  provide some opposition to the agreement in the courtroom. So what he's going to do is ask for [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0&t=50.8s)]
*  some clarification on whether this person, Clement, this former Solicitor General believes that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0&t=55.28s)]
*  there's everything basically is okay in terms of dropping the case. He's going to overview a couple [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0&t=61.68s)]
*  of different procedural motions in this case and he's going to walk the judge through some [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0&t=66.8s)]
*  points of clarification. There are about five of them in this filing that the judge wanted clarity on. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0&t=72.88s)]
*  The judge also wrote that he obviously understands the public pressure coming from this case and that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0&t=77.2s)]
*  expediency is key here. However, he did not just flat out agree with both sides to drop the case. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0&t=83.04s)]
*  This is just a few things that really he had on the table to do in this case. So as of now, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  Mayor Adams' criminal trial, which is expected for mid-April, has been cleared off the calendar [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  and that on March 7th there'll be another hearing in this case after the friend of the court, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0&t=99.12s)]
*  this man Paul Clement, files answers to the judge's questions about basically the agreement [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0&t=103.92s)]
*  between the Department of Justice and Mayor Adams and his attorneys to drop these charges [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0&t=109.6s)]
*  through at least November. All right, Jake Rosen, thank you so much for your time in bringing us [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0&t=113.36s)]
*  that breaking news. Appreciate your insight there. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-KsPxcxEq0&t=118.8s)]
