# American-Israeli among 3 hostages released in ceasefire deal | Special Report
**CBS News:** [February 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ)
*  This is a CBS News special report. I'm Karissa Lawson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=0.0s)]
*  A new round of hostages were just released under the Israel Hamas ceasefire agreement, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=6.0s)]
*  including the first American. American Israeli citizen Keith Siegel was kidnapped from his [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=10.88s)]
*  kibbutz. Along with his wife in the October 7, 2023 attack, she was part of an earlier [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=16.12s)]
*  hostage release in November. Siegel is originally from North Carolina. He was released shortly [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=21.64s)]
*  after Yarden Bibas and Ofer Kalduron were freed earlier this morning. They were both [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=27.48s)]
*  kidnapped from a separate kibbutz. Over 180 Palestinian prisoners are also expected to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=33.32s)]
*  be released from Israeli custody today as part of this exchange. CBS's Haley Yad is [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=38.84s)]
*  in Hostage Square in Tel Aviv for us right now. Haley, take us through the process. We've [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=44.68000000000001s)]
*  seen other hostages released in recent days. Now that we saw Keith Siegel turned over into [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  the hands of the Red Cross, how soon will we actually be reunited with his family? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=55.72s)]
*  Keith was handed over to the Red Cross. He was then brought and handed over to Israeli [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=59.32s)]
*  military officials where then he was brought out of Gaza to a reception center. There, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=68.32s)]
*  his wife was waiting for him. So far we have heard that he hasn't moved on from that reception [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=73.92s)]
*  center yet. The other two hostages have. What normally happens in these exchanges is there's [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=79.88s)]
*  a brief stop at these reception centers just to do a health check to make sure that the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=85.28s)]
*  hostages is not in any immediate danger. And then they're brought either by helicopter [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=90.0s)]
*  or car to another hospital inside Israel where they're reunited with more of their family [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=95.44s)]
*  and friends. So describe the difference between the hostage releases that took place today [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=100.78s)]
*  and the chaotic scenes surrounding the release of hostages in Gaza on Thursday that brought [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=106.08s)]
*  basically condemnation from Israeli leaders. Today's exchange releases were remarkably [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=111.88s)]
*  different from what we saw on Thursday. You'll recall that absolutely chaotic scene when [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=119.88s)]
*  two hostages we were expecting at one location were due to be released. There were enormous [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=126.19999999999999s)]
*  crowds. We couldn't even make out one of the hostages from the video that we were watching [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=131.48s)]
*  as he was handed over to the Red Cross. Another hostage, Arbel Yahud, as she was being walked [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  through that crowd looked absolutely terrified. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  said that he was demanding more reassurances for that hostage safety would be taken into [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  account. He delayed the release of the Palestinian prisoners. He eventually got those reassurances [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=155.16s)]
*  and the prisoners were released. Today couldn't have been more different. There were much [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=161.32s)]
*  smaller crowds. Everything appeared much more organized. There were really clear ways in [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=166.16s)]
*  and out for the Red Cross vehicles to take the hostages, to hand over to Israeli military. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=171.72s)]
*  And the exchanges, the handover happened really quickly. So clearly there was a shift from [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=179.92s)]
*  what we saw on Thursday. So tell us something. What could possibly jeopardize this ceasefire [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=186.36s)]
*  deal and future releases at this point? This is an incredibly precarious deal. It's three [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=191.96s)]
*  phases. We're in the first phase. That lasts 42 days. Already over the last couple weeks [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=201.24s)]
*  there have been a few moments where it looks like things could go off the rails. They haven't. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=206.8s)]
*  But if you think about how much time there still is as part of this deal, there could [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=212.67999999999998s)]
*  be many more opportunities for things to fall apart. Each phase needs to be negotiated during [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=218.11999999999998s)]
*  the phase that comes before it. So we're approaching the point where the parties are going to have [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=223.48s)]
*  to come back to the table to negotiate phase two of this deal. That offers another opportunity [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=228.39999999999998s)]
*  for things potentially to go off the rails. But we've been speaking to people here despite [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=234.76s)]
*  this. Everyone's very aware of how precarious the situation is. Here in Hashtag Square people [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=240.28s)]
*  are overjoyed to see people returned to Israel from Gaza. And they're optimistic, but very [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=245.66s)]
*  cautiously so. Overjoyed for sure. For now some bittersweet moments in this ongoing conflict. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=254.14000000000001s)]
*  Helyad in Hashtag Square and Tel Aviv, thank you so much. Our coverage will continue on [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=261.64s)]
*  CBS News 24 seven, your local news and CBS Saturday morning. This has been a CBS News [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=266.28s)]
*  special report. I'm Carissa Lawson. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYiIGKxvUFQ&t=271.32s)]
