# DOGE personnel involved in security incident at USAID, sources say
**CBS News:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0)
*  Soon, President Donald Trump will speak with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=0.0s)]
*  the second time today. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=3.4s)]
*  The conversation comes just a day before 25 percent tariffs are set to take effect on [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=5.08s)]
*  our northern border. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=9.78s)]
*  And hours after, President Trump paused his tariffs on Mexico following a conversation [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  with their president. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=16.2s)]
*  And CBS News has learned that USA, the United States Agency for International Development, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=17.76s)]
*  which oversees humanitarian development and security programs in about 120 countries, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=22.56s)]
*  will be merged into the State Department with significant cuts in the workforce. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=28.44s)]
*  All employees were ordered to work remotely today and not come into the office. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=33.36s)]
*  The escalation comes on the heels of a tumultuous weekend when two top security officials at [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=37.400000000000006s)]
*  the agency attempted to block personnel from the Elon Musk-run Department of Government [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=41.44s)]
*  Efficiency, or DOJ, from accessing U.S. aid systems. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  They were placed on administrative leave. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=50.32s)]
*  We've also learned that the agency's chief of staff has resigned as a result of the matter. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=52.24s)]
*  Meantime, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been named the acting administrator of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=56.64s)]
*  USAID. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=60.28s)]
*  He is in El Salvador after stopping in Panama at President Trump's request as he calls [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=61.28s)]
*  to reduce China's influence over the Panama Canal and end mass migration. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=65.52s)]
*  We recognize that many of the people who seek mass migration are often victims and victimized [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=70.48s)]
*  along the way. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=76.16s)]
*  It's not good for anyone. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=77.48s)]
*  The only people who benefit from mass migration are traffickers. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=78.48s)]
*  And so this is a program that shows how cooperating with our strong allies here in Panama can [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=82.8s)]
*  help to stem the flow by creating a disincentive, by sending a clear message that if you come [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=87.64s)]
*  and you come irregularly, you may be stopped and you may be returned to your country of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=93.56s)]
*  origin. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=98.36s)]
*  For more, I want to bring in CBS News White House producer and reporter, Olivia Rinaldi. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=99.36s)]
*  Olivia, you're outside the U.S. aid building. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=102.64s)]
*  Things have been rapidly developing. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=105.24s)]
*  What's the situation there now? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=107.24s)]
*  Yeah, Lindsay, just to give you a sense of what just happened, we heard from Democratic [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=108.56s)]
*  lawmakers outside the USAID building here in downtown Washington. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=113.52s)]
*  And after that press conference, they went inside to try to gain access into the building [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=117.88s)]
*  behind me. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=122.76s)]
*  That is happening right now. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=123.76s)]
*  Democratic lawmakers inside trying to gain access. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=125.6s)]
*  Now, all of this comes after we learned over the weekend that a lot of USAID staffers no [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=127.68s)]
*  longer have access to their email. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=133.68s)]
*  We learned about a security incident where Elon Musk and members of DOGE tried to enter [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=136.24s)]
*  the building and tried to get into some secure areas. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  We know there was an issue with security officials on site. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=144.2s)]
*  Those two security officials are now placed on leave. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=147.92s)]
*  And as a result of all of this, the chief of staff who Trump placed to be in charge [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=151.32s)]
*  of USAID resigned on Sunday. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=155.2s)]
*  So of course, today we heard from Democratic lawmakers really pushing back on one, the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=157.84s)]
*  efforts to dismantle USAID, but two, not allowing these staffers, one, to have access to their [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=161.28s)]
*  emails, but two, access to the building. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=168.4s)]
*  They were given an email statement last night that the building will be shut down today [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=170.16s)]
*  and for them to wait for their notice. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=174.76s)]
*  So all of this developing right now very quickly, the situation evolving. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=176.68s)]
*  If USAID is in fact merged with the State Department, what will the future of the agency [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=181.44s)]
*  look like? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=185.44s)]
*  And is this in lieu of shutting it down completely, which is what Elon Musk had said they wanted [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=186.44s)]
*  to do? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=190.24s)]
*  It would appear that it would be in lieu of shutting it down completely. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  If they merge with the State Department, we would expect massive cuts. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=195.56s)]
*  They would remain a humanitarian agency, but they would not be the size that they are now. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=199.36s)]
*  Just to give you kind of a scope of what they are, there are about 10,000 employees with [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=203.8s)]
*  USAID across the world. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  About two thirds of them actually are in foreign countries. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=209.56s)]
*  So this would be a massive scale down really of that workforce. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=212.52s)]
*  Also, they control about $40 billion in congressionally approved government assistance to a lot of [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=217.44s)]
*  these countries, which they hand out to NGOs, humanitarian groups. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=222.84s)]
*  Because of that, the U.S. is really able to expand its soft power around the globe. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=226.32s)]
*  We heard from Ilhan Omar, the representative from Minnesota, and she said she was a refugee [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=231.6s)]
*  in a camp. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=236.04s)]
*  It was because of USAID that she was able to really have food, have a roof over her [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=237.04s)]
*  head, have assistance. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=243.52s)]
*  Because of that, she has a better feeling, had a better feeling about the U.S., and of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=245.23999999999998s)]
*  course now she's here as a congressman. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=248.28s)]
*  So a lot of developing in this situation that we have to watch very closely, especially [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=250.04s)]
*  in the next coming hours, what this means entirely for this agency that is so focused [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=254.16s)]
*  on humanitarian assistance worldwide. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  All this is happening at the same time as these tariffs are potentially being levied. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=260.76s)]
*  So what are we learning about Trump's calls today with our neighboring nations? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=264.46s)]
*  Well, we know that we're scaling back some of those tariffs against Mexico. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=268.2s)]
*  Trump spoke with the leader of Mexico, Claudia Scheinbaum, earlier today and she announced [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  that they came to an agreement. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=277.20000000000005s)]
*  There would be more troops on the U.S.-Mexico border, about 10,000 additional troops. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=279.48s)]
*  And because of that, Trump would not put on the 25 percent tariffs that he said he would [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=283.6s)]
*  put on until next month. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  And he said there would be a rolling basis of deciding whether or not to place these [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  tariffs back on Mexico. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=296.20000000000005s)]
*  Now we know momentarily in the next hour or so he is expected to have a conversation with [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=298.12s)]
*  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=302.56s)]
*  He spoke with him earlier today as well. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=304.52s)]
*  So we will need to watch very closely to see what goes on with Canada if they could potentially [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=307.24s)]
*  stave away from these tariffs as Mexico did. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=313.6s)]
*  Olivia Rinaldi, thank you. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rjhXc4Kr0&t=316.84000000000003s)]
