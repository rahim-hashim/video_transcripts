# Trump says Americans could feel "some pain" with new tariffs set to go into effect
**CBS News:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g)
*  We begin this morning with new tariffs that are set to take effect tomorrow on goods from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=0.0s)]
*  Canada, Mexico and China. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=4.12s)]
*  President Trump warns Americans could feel the pain from retaliatory tariffs. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  He says fentanyl pouring into the U.S. is a major factor as to why those tariffs are [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=10.28s)]
*  in place. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=14.56s)]
*  Fentanyl has killed this year at least 200,000 people. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=15.56s)]
*  It's pouring in from China through Mexico and Canada, and they've got to stop it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=20.56s)]
*  And if they don't stop it, the tariffs are going to get worse, a lot worse. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=26.2s)]
*  Well, Wall Street doesn't like this message. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=31.2s)]
*  Off to a rocky start of trading. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=33.76s)]
*  Since the tariffs were announced, the Dow is down more than 500 points, a little over [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  1.3 percent. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=39.32s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News correspondent Natalie Brand from the White House to talk [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=40.32s)]
*  more about this. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  So what is the administration's strategy surrounding the retaliatory tariffs, given that the president [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=46.28s)]
*  of the United States who campaigned on bringing prices down, if you recall, Natalie, as I [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=52.64s)]
*  know you do, that he said the day that he took office, prices were going to go down [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=57.4s)]
*  day one. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=61.52s)]
*  Now he's telling us that Americans will feel the pain. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=62.52s)]
*  So what's the plan for those retaliatory tariffs? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=65.04s)]
*  Yeah, Vlad, and we're hoping to maybe learn more later today. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=68.04s)]
*  We did learn a short time ago that President Trump spoke to Canadian Prime Minister Justin [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=72.36s)]
*  Trudeau and we'll speak to him again later this afternoon as those retaliatory tariffs [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=78.56s)]
*  were announced over the weekend in response to President Trump's announced tariffs. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=85.56s)]
*  So those two leaders, they are communicating. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=91.16s)]
*  That is significant. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=94.08s)]
*  We'll have to see what happens from that later today. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=95.08s)]
*  But again, what set off the events this weekend, Trump's announcement, his plans, executive [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=99.6s)]
*  order to impose these tariffs, 25 percent on goods from Canada and Mexico, 10 percent [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=107.52s)]
*  on China. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=114.44s)]
*  And his rationale, he says, is to curb the flow of undocumented migrants at the northern [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  at the southern border, also illicit drugs at the northern and southern border. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=122.2s)]
*  This is, as you noted, something that Trump has campaigned on these tariffs, saying in [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=127.68s)]
*  part that he also wants to spur manufacturing here in the United States, generate revenue. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=133.88s)]
*  But what we are seeing is just a massive reaction across a number of key sectors. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=140.08s)]
*  You saw the stock markets react this morning and there are just a ton of industry groups [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=147.36s)]
*  and key stakeholders really sounding the alarm about the impacts to industry and the American [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=153.24s)]
*  consumer. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=160.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=161.32s)]
*  So, Natalie, the other question that I'm curious if the president has addressed is why he is [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  putting in a 25 percent tariff on one of our closest allies. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=169.72s)]
*  Canadians, as you know, have bled and some have given the ultimate sacrifice in support [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  of the United States and its goals going back to World War II and continuing on until the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=177.84s)]
*  global war on terror in Afghanistan. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=182.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, China, who the president suggests is an adversary of the United States and most [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=184.76s)]
*  geopolitical strategists agree is only being hit with a 10 percent tariff. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  Has he explained why? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=193.76s)]
*  This has increased tensions with two allies, Canada and Mexico, and also two key trade [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  partners. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  We know that the president really is trying to use this to put pressure, negotiating pressure [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=206.64s)]
*  on these two countries, again, to try and achieve his goals at the border. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=214.04s)]
*  But, you know, the impacts of this are really remain to be seen, especially we'll have to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=219.72s)]
*  wait and see how this plays out if negotiations are able to get anywhere before these tariffs [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  are set to take place. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=231.32s)]
*  But you mentioned Canada already, the auto industry, the automakers and facilities in [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  Canada reacting over the weekend and into the day. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=238.92s)]
*  Home builders, a lot of soft lumber is imported from Canada and Mexico that's used for drywall. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  So the Home Builders Association warning that this is going to drive up the price of housing [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=252.64s)]
*  even more. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=258.12s)]
*  Farmers say they could be hit hardest by the retaliatory tariffs that Canada has announced [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=258.76s)]
*  on products ranging from dairy to fruits. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=264.96s)]
*  Also, restaurants saying, you know, prices will no doubt have to go up given all of the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=269.12s)]
*  food that is imported from places such as Mexico. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=274.76s)]
*  I want to read you a quote from Farmers for Free Trade. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=278.96s)]
*  They put this out this weekend. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=283.24s)]
*  They say placing tariffs on three largest export markets for American farmers and ranchers, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=284.8s)]
*  particularly for an extended period of time, will have severe consequences. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=290.64s)]
*  They go on to say that it will be a disadvantage. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=295.56s)]
*  They could they're worried about losing market share to places like South America. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=300.79999999999995s)]
*  So really the question on everyone's minds, will these tariffs take effect on Tuesday [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=305.28s)]
*  for how long and how will the impacts continue to ripple across this country and beyond? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=310.4s)]
*  Seeing those ripple effects, as we pointed out with the stock market, Natalie, which [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=319.28s)]
*  is down. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=322.12s)]
*  And that is pricing into the market is pricing into the fact that there may be an 11th hour [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=323.04s)]
*  reprisal of these tariffs based on these calls that the president is having with Trudeau [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=329.92s)]
*  and the president of Mexico. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=333.92s)]
*  But once those tariffs go into effect, we can expect to see a sharp decrease in the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=336.04s)]
*  market. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=340.96s)]
*  And that is going to affect Americans 401Ks, their retirement accounts. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=341.48s)]
*  And that's not a good sign. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=345.92s)]
*  I know the president is tweeting that everyone thinks it's fantastic. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=347.48s)]
*  Market certainly doesn't think so. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=350.16s)]
*  Natalie Brand for us at the White House this morning. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=351.68s)]
*  Thank you very much, Natalie. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=353.8s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC2aBEUX57g&t=354.72s)]
