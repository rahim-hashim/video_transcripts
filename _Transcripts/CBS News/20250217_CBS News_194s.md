# Luigi Mangione issues first statement since arrest
**CBS News:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q)
*  Man accused of murdering United Health Care CEO Brian Thompson will be in a New York City courtroom Friday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=0.0s)]
*  26-year-old Luigi Mangione was charged with first-degree murder for Thompson's death. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=5.5s)]
*  And despite this, Mangione has amassed a following of public sympathizers and issued his first public statement since his arrest on Friday, saying in part, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=10.0s)]
*  I am overwhelmed by and grateful for everyone who has written me to share their stories and express their support. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=18.0s)]
*  Anna Schechter joins us now. She's the senior coordinating producer for CBS News' Crime and Public Safety Unit. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=24.0s)]
*  I mean, that statement in and of itself is so extraordinary. What do we need to know about his court appearance? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=29.0s)]
*  Well, this is the first time we're seeing Luigi Mangione since his December appearances. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=34.0s)]
*  He was arraigned on both the state charges and the federal charges in December, and it's been pretty quiet. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=39.0s)]
*  But now we're going to see him in court. Potentially there might be a camera in court because this hearing on Friday is for the state charges. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=45.0s)]
*  So sometimes a judge might allow a camera in court. It's a preliminary hearing before a trial. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=53.0s)]
*  We don't actually know what's going to happen. All we know is that he will be there on Friday. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=61.0s)]
*  And this is the first of a series. We haven't really seen him. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=67.0s)]
*  But on Monday, we have a hearing in his Pennsylvania charges. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=71.0s)]
*  And then March 19th, the next one on the schedule is his the federal charges. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=76.0s)]
*  And that's important because one of those four federal charges could carry the death penalty. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=82.0s)]
*  Wow. OK, so a full docket, including some with heavy consequences. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=87.0s)]
*  Mangione's lawyers have created an online crowd fund for his legal defense. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=91.0s)]
*  How much have they raised and how rare is it to have a trial like this with so much fanfare in which a murder defendant who is innocent until proven guilty, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=96.0s)]
*  but nonetheless a murder defendant, raises so much money in a matter of months. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=106.0s)]
*  I'll take the second part of your question first. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=111.0s)]
*  This is really unusual to have a website developed by a legal defense team, seemingly because there's just so much interest in the case. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=113.0s)]
*  They have an FAQ section. They have a way to actually frequently asked questions. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=123.0s)]
*  Yes. What does that say? Ask questions about Luigi Mangione, when his next court appearance will be. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=127.0s)]
*  How do I get in touch? What can I send him? Can I send him more books? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=133.0s)]
*  They ask that people stop sending so many books. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=137.0s)]
*  There's a way actually to get a message through to Luigi Mangione and they know some of this, a portion of this might become public at some point. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=140.0s)]
*  So I have in all of my years covering crime and public safety, never seen a website come up like this. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=149.0s)]
*  Now, his defense attorney didn't create the legal defense fund, so to speak. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=156.0s)]
*  It's a GiveSendGo account and they have raised, the organizers have raised more than $475,000. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=162.0s)]
*  Almost half a million dollars. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=171.0s)]
*  Right now, that's right. They state on the website that their goal is a million dollars, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=173.0s)]
*  but the organizers put out a statement recently saying they've been in touch with Mangione's legal team [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=178.0s)]
*  and that his top lawyers are actually accepting these donations for the legal fund. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=184.0s)]
*  Anna Schechter, thank you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el2U8itmC7Q&t=191.0s)]
