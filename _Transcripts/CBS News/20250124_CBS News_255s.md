# Trump reacts to Republicans who won't vote for Hegseth
**CBS News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk)
*  All right, well, all eyes now on Capitol Hill and President Trump's most [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=0.0s)]
*  controversial cabinet picks so far. Pete Hegseth, the final confirmation vote [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=3.42s)]
*  for his bid to lead the Defense Department happening later on tonight, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=8.22s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader John Thune making good on that promise to keep the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=12.0s)]
*  Senate working after hours to make sure President Trump gets his cabinet. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=15.540000000000001s)]
*  Lawmakers voted to advance Hegs's nomination in a 51 to 49 vote yesterday. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=20.02s)]
*  Two Republicans breaking the ranks to vote no Senator Lisa Murkowski from [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=26.7s)]
*  Alaska on the left and Senator Susan Collins from Maine there on the right. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=31.7s)]
*  President Trump reacted to this earlier today and said he was, quote, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=36.26s)]
*  surprised. Let's take a listen. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=39.98s)]
*  He's a very, very good man. I hope he makes it. I hope he makes it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=42.58s)]
*  I was very surprised that Collins and Murkowski would do that. And of course, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=48.28s)]
*  Mitch is always a no vote. I guess that's a no vote. How about Mitch? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=53.9s)]
*  You what? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=59.699999999999996s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=61.699999999999996s)]
*  Let's see what happens. So let's bring in CBS News political reporter Torian [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=63.7s)]
*  Small, who was live for us on Capitol Hill. Torian, the goal for top GOP [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=66.8s)]
*  lawmakers tonight get Hegseth over the finish line. But this latest headline [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=71.1s)]
*  about that he spoke to senators, he said that he paid about $50,000 to a [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=76.62s)]
*  woman who accused him of sexual assault in 2017. Is that latest revelation? Is [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=81.3s)]
*  that gonna make it difficult for him? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=86.97999999999999s)]
*  Liz, no new revelation, allegation or claims that have since clouded this [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=91.1s)]
*  confirmation process around Pete Hegseth has moved this Republican Party [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=97.25999999999999s)]
*  conference here in the Senate side at large. We've seen, though, not just this [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=102.7s)]
*  recent revelation of this payout. We've also seen a police report from 2017 [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=108.58s)]
*  that also outlined an alleged instance of sexual assault against Hegseth. And [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=114.34s)]
*  just a few days ago, we also received an affidavit from Danielle Hegseth, the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=119.78s)]
*  former sister in law to Pete, also outlining laying out some instances, she [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=126.22s)]
*  says, or of sexual misconduct, abuse and of public drunkenness. Now, none of this [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=131.7s)]
*  outside of these two Republicans have really swayed the conference. Murkowski [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=139.38s)]
*  and Collins, though, are Trump skeptics. They've often broke with party lines in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=145.06s)]
*  order to go against the grain. So it's interesting to see that the president [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=151.38s)]
*  saying he was surprised by their decision to come out right and say they [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=155.98s)]
*  won't be voting for Hegseth. It is, though, fascinating that he brought up [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=159.9s)]
*  Mitch McConnell. He hasn't telegraphed how he will vote, but that could signal [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=164.1s)]
*  that at least three are willing to defect on this on this vote for Hegseth. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=168.7s)]
*  Yeah, so let's crush those numbers for us. Tarian to Republican senators. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=174.18s)]
*  Reminder are no. Mitch McConnell is a who knows Hegseth can only afford to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=178.34s)]
*  lose a few Republican votes. Are there any other senators wavering here? Is [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=183.44s)]
*  there a possibility that he doesn't get pushed through? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=187.38s)]
*  Yeah, Liz. So as you know, if those three decide to vote no, then [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=192.5s)]
*  vice president J. D. Vance could step in as the president of the Senate to cast [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=197.86s)]
*  that tie breaking vote there for that simple majority needed to push him [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=202.3s)]
*  across the finish line. Who I'm watching, though, is Senator Joni Ernst [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=205.82s)]
*  of Iowa. Although she was a part of the panel that ultimately advanced him to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=210.0s)]
*  the Senate floor for a vote, she had previously had reservations that she's [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=215.01999999999998s)]
*  expressed about whether or not she would commit to him because she's not [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=219.94s)]
*  only a combat veteran herself and she was rubbed the wrong way by some of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=224.22s)]
*  his previous controversial remarks about women and conduct combat. She's [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=228.82s)]
*  also a survivor sexual assault. So I'll be interested to see if she does hold [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  the line and continue to move forward with her vote. Her yes vote on him, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=239.14s)]
*  even though we're getting some more news around his conduct, although [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=244.26s)]
*  Hexeth has denied those himself. All right, CBS News political reporter [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=248.26s)]
*  Torian Small. Thanks so much, Torian. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grt0YHCugFk&t=252.54s)]
