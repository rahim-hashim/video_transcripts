# How dismantling the Education Department will impact staff, budgets and operations
**CBS News:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA)
*  President Trump gearing up to sign an [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=0.0s)]
*  executive order that calls for the [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=2.18s)]
*  dismantling of the Education Department. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=4.24s)]
*  The White House says it won't be today, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=6.0s)]
*  but CBS News sources tell us the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=8.28s)]
*  president is working on it and a [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=10.36s)]
*  reminder for our viewers earlier this week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=12.18s)]
*  Education Secretary Linda McMahon [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=14.44s)]
*  foreshadowed the move in an email [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=15.74s)]
*  titled our department's final mission. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=17.8s)]
*  In it, she said the restoration of [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=19.56s)]
*  the department will profoundly impact [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=22.06s)]
*  staff budgets and agency operations. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=24.060000000000002s)]
*  So joining us live now is Matt Barnum, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=25.96s)]
*  the K through 12 education reporter [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=29.48s)]
*  for the Wall Street Journal. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=30.92s)]
*  Matt, thanks so much for being with us. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=32.36s)]
*  I want to bring this up because you broke [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=34.28s)]
*  the news that President Trump was expected [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=36.32s)]
*  to issue that executive order aimed at [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=38.32s)]
*  eliminating the Department of Education [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=40.4s)]
*  as soon as today, Thursday, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  White House Press Secretary Caroline [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=43.4s)]
*  Levitt called it quote fake news. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=44.92s)]
*  You want to respond to that? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=46.64s)]
*  Well, sure, yeah, but we were [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=49.28s)]
*  actually very careful in our language. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=50.84s)]
*  What we reported was that Trump could [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  sign this executive order as soon as today. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  A number of other outlets, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=56.8s)]
*  like the U.S. have independently confirmed that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=58.28s)]
*  So it's not especially surprising to me [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  that they've changed the timing, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=62.32s)]
*  which we always knew was possible. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=63.56s)]
*  And we also reported that the executive order [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=65.28s)]
*  was in draft form and it could change. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  All right, I just want to read that quote [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=69.84s)]
*  from your Wall Street Journal article there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=71.0s)]
*  President Trump expected to issue [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=72.76s)]
*  an executive order as soon as Thursday. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=74.2s)]
*  They're clarifying the language. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=76.94s)]
*  But I want to go over what is it that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=78.88s)]
*  the Department of Education actually does? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=81.26s)]
*  What's its purpose? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, excellent question because [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=86.16s)]
*  there's lots of discussion about this [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=88.02s)]
*  without fully understanding what it does. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=89.94s)]
*  There's a lot of debate about whether [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=92.22s)]
*  what it does is good or worthwhile and effective. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=93.53999999999999s)]
*  But what it does is in K-12 education, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=95.53999999999999s)]
*  it sends money to schools for students [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=98.34s)]
*  with disabilities and low income students. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=100.42s)]
*  It also runs various smaller grant programs [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=102.34s)]
*  and funding streams like for charter schools [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=105.17999999999999s)]
*  or teacher training. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=107.3s)]
*  And in higher education, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=108.66s)]
*  it runs the Federal Student Loan Program [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=109.82s)]
*  and offers grants to low income students to attend college. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=111.92s)]
*  In both areas, K-12 and higher ed, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=115.58s)]
*  it enforces civil rights law that bans discrimination [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=117.54s)]
*  based on race, gender, or other protected classes. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=121.06s)]
*  And it also collects data [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=124.34s)]
*  and funds research and education. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=125.66000000000001s)]
*  And Matt, there's a lot of parents though [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=128.02s)]
*  who are concerned that if the Department of Education [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=130.14000000000001s)]
*  is eliminated, that will only add to the issues [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  so many public schools are facing. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=135.62s)]
*  Trouble retaining teachers, low literacy rates, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=137.6s)]
*  lack of resources. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=140.02s)]
*  Can you set the record straight though? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=141.68s)]
*  Does the Department of Education have any impact [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=143.62s)]
*  on the quality of education in our public schools? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=146.54s)]
*  That is sort of the billion or trillion dollar question [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=151.0s)]
*  for the total size of K-12 education spending. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=155.18s)]
*  And that's sort of a political question [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=158.5s)]
*  and people disagree about that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  Some people think that the department has played [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=161.73999999999998s)]
*  an absolutely vital role in supporting schools. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=163.7s)]
*  And even if it's not the biggest funder of education, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=166.82s)]
*  in fact, it's a relatively small funder of K-12 education, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=170.1s)]
*  it still plays an important role, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=174.14s)]
*  as some of these supporters say, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=175.42s)]
*  of protecting disadvantaged students [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=176.33999999999997s)]
*  and protecting civil rights. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=177.98s)]
*  Critics say it's not effective in that, you know, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=179.5s)]
*  it adds too much paperwork and spreads [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=182.1s)]
*  what they would describe as woke ideas. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=185.54s)]
*  So there's, you know, debates about how effective it is. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=187.57999999999998s)]
*  So what's gonna happen if we eliminate the department [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=192.5s)]
*  or dismantle it piece by piece? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=195.01999999999998s)]
*  What happens to those Pell Grants, federal aid, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=196.5s)]
*  and the programs for economically disadvantaged families [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=199.33999999999997s)]
*  and those children with disabilities? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=201.98s)]
*  What happens if that's left up to the states? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=204.44s)]
*  What does that look like? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=207.04s)]
*  We don't know exactly how this would play out [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=208.84s)]
*  in part because the draft of the executive order [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=211.56s)]
*  that we obtained, which again, that could change, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=214.34s)]
*  doesn't exactly spell out [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=216.92s)]
*  what it wants education secretary to do. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=218.52s)]
*  It just says within existing law, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=221.12s)]
*  the education secretary, Linda McMahon, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=224.44s)]
*  needs to do everything she can [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=226.48s)]
*  to facilitate the closure of the department. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=227.88s)]
*  Now, within existing law is a very important caveat [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=230.76s)]
*  because the department was created by Congress [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=233.88s)]
*  and most of its major programs were created by Congress. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=236.48s)]
*  So President Trump and Linda McMahon cannot snap [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=239.4s)]
*  their fingers and close the department. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=242.6s)]
*  Linda McMahon also said that the big programs [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  like funding for students with disabilities [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  would not go away, but they might move it elsewhere [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=250.94s)]
*  and try to make it more efficient. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=254.24s)]
*  Now, it's not clear how moving it elsewhere [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=255.85999999999999s)]
*  would improve things or not. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  And it's also not clear if Congress would go along [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=261.52s)]
*  with any sort of move. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=264.58s)]
*  The other option that they have, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=265.42s)]
*  which they've already started doing, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=266.5s)]
*  is sort of diminish the department from within. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=267.92s)]
*  Try to cut various programs, reduce staff. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=270.72s)]
*  And again, they've already cut discretionary programs, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=274.14s)]
*  smaller ones, and they've already done that to some extent. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=277.26s)]
*  And they could continue trying to do that [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=280.46000000000004s)]
*  as a strategy of sort of diminishing it from within. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=282.54s)]
*  Wall Street Journal reporter, Matt Barnum. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=286.5s)]
*  Thank you so much, Matt, for being with us. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=288.1s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Kl4KMe0KA&t=289.94s)]
