# Changes to Trump tariffs confuse stock market investors
**CBS News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs)
*  All right, so we're watching the Dow because we know it is involving your money the markets reacting to new job data following a rollercoaster [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=0.0s)]
*  Week on Wall Street and you can see once again at this hour [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=7.68s)]
*  We're in negative territory president Trump's swerving trade policies have a lot of investors on edge [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  So the Dow is down more than 3% over the week the Nasdaq now officially in [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=17.44s)]
*  Correction territory and his questions really swirl over what it all means for you the American public and American businesses [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=22.02s)]
*  Economists say today's job data really points to signs of a slight slowdown in the labor market. So let's talk about that [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=28.56s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News money watch correspondent. Kelly O'Grady [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=35.32s)]
*  Kelly watched you on CBS mornings learned a lot today for our audience. What does this data point to? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=38.76s)]
*  So the jobs report today, I think there was some relief to be perfectly honest from [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=47.0s)]
*  Investors and economists not necessarily reflected in what's happening in the market right now [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=53.16s)]
*  But it was a slight slowdown. So we were looking to add overall [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=57.38s)]
*  170,000 jobs it came in at a hundred fifty one thousand the unemployment rate ticked up to four point one percent [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=62.34s)]
*  Versus four percent last month not a lot of movement [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=69.22s)]
*  So what that tells me is the hiring picture the open rolls that companies are adding [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=72.74s)]
*  Didn't fall off a cliff. It remained pretty steady. I think what is important though is [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=78.66s)]
*  This number does not include most of the doge layoffs that we're seeing it doesn't include [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=84.82s)]
*  Probably a lot of the consumer sentiment the pullback in spending that may ultimately [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=90.69999999999999s)]
*  Impact companies and the way they're thinking about hiring and I put this number in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=95.74s)]
*  Context with a report that we got yesterday, which was about layoffs [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=100.34s)]
*  So the one that we're talking about today is hiring [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=104.06s)]
*  The one yesterday was layoffs that really saw a huge huge spike versus last month [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=106.1s)]
*  245 percent increase the worst that we've seen since [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=112.3s)]
*  Midsummer of that first year of the pandemic and so I sort of put this two together of today was a pretty good number [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=116.66s)]
*  We're slowing down slightly, but it's really going to be these next couple of months where we see have companies [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=122.94s)]
*  Change their minds with tariffs with consumer spending pullback with that sentiment just having a lot of anxiety in the ethos [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=129.66s)]
*  So I'm not I guess that the tea leaves are we're okay [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=136.96s)]
*  But there's some anxiety about where we may be going read well and some of that anxiety could very well be rooted in Trump's [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=140.66s)]
*  on again off again policies [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=146.26s)]
*  Rattled Wall Street, of course, we're talking about the terrorists and the uncertainty [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=148.82s)]
*  If that continues in our nation [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=153.01999999999998s)]
*  Are we seeing that this could perhaps be a test of what the president's policies are over the next what two months three months? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=155.7s)]
*  Well, and I think that uncertainty that question is really why you are seeing so much volatility in the markets because [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=163.74s)]
*  People are trying to read the minds of the president and it's very difficult right now because one day tariffs are on the next day [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=170.74s)]
*  There's a pause this country that country when the deadlines are happening [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=178.74s)]
*  And so it is unclear whether this is something that is going to be [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=182.74s)]
*  Long-standing that we are going to be living under these tests for a while or it may be a negotiation tactic [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=187.74s)]
*  And I bring it back to the piece about the job market [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=193.74s)]
*  These companies are having to decide without a clear picture of what the economic what the tariff landscape is going to look like for the next year of hiring decisions of layoffs [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=196.74s)]
*  You know are their costs going to go up and they need to make adjustments in other areas [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=207.74s)]
*  So it's not just investors and consumers that are seeing this picture and going do I buy do I sell but it's also businesses that are making major decisions without a lot of insight to what that picture is going to look like [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=211.74s)]
*  Well and relative to that temporary pause in Mexico we know that we're looking at what an April 2nd date to where those tariffs could very well go back into place [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=224.74s)]
*  So we know you'll be watching it April 2nd is not too far away Kelly [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=233.74s)]
*  Neither is the weekend we hope you have a good one my friend take care thank you so much [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dsw6IsIs&t=236.74s)]
