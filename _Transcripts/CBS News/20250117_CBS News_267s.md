# TikTok CEO's message for Trump after Supreme Court ban ruling
**CBS News:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg)
*  Today, the Supreme Court ruled to uphold a law that would prohibit the use of TikTok [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=0.0s)]
*  in the U.S. The justices unanimously determined that the law requiring the hugely popular [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=4.92s)]
*  app to either be sold or banned in the nation does not violate the First Amendment. The [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=9.9s)]
*  court also said the measure is necessary to address, quote, well-supported national security [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  concerns. The CEO of TikTok posted his response to the decision on the app. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=20.56s)]
*  On behalf of everyone at TikTok and all our users across the country, I want to thank [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=26.48s)]
*  President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  available in the United States. This is a strong stand for the First Amendment and against [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=36.34s)]
*  arbitrary censorship. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=41.24s)]
*  The president-elect also responded on social media this morning saying, quote, the Supreme [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=43.68s)]
*  Court decision was expected and everyone must respect it. My decision on TikTok will be [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=48.08s)]
*  made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=52.72s)]
*  tuned. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=57.2s)]
*  CBS News Supreme Court and legal producer Catherine Cole is following all of this in [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=58.2s)]
*  Washington for us. So, Catherine, can you further explain the court's decision, particularly [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=61.68s)]
*  how the justices concluded this law does not violate the right to free speech? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=65.6s)]
*  Yeah. So this is a unanimous 9-0 decision saying that this law doesn't violate either [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=70.32s)]
*  Americans' free speech right or TikTok's free speech right. What they concluded is that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=76.44s)]
*  this law indirectly burdens speech, but that laws that further an important governmental [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=81.28s)]
*  interest can have these indirect burdens on speech so long as they don't go too far. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=86.4s)]
*  And the court said the data privacy problems that Congress identified that the government [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  has defended, the fact that the Chinese parent company of TikTok can access the data of anyone [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=95.28s)]
*  who has TikTok downloaded onto their phone, that that's a real problem. Congress judged [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=101.36s)]
*  that was a problem and that the court isn't going to say that Congress didn't have a sufficient [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=105.68s)]
*  basis to assert that interest, nor that that interest wasn't important. And so the court [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=110.44s)]
*  concluded basically Congress did what it needed to do here and we can't overstep what Congress [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=115.08s)]
*  has decided. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=120.6s)]
*  How surprising is it that the decision was unanimous? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=121.6s)]
*  Not that surprising. I'll give you two reasons why. The first is that the lower court ruling [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=125.8s)]
*  was also unanimous and that court also had Republican appointees, Democratic appointees. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=129.96s)]
*  Basically every judge who has looked at this law has said it passes constitutional muster. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=135.1s)]
*  And then also the court is unanimous more often than you'd think. In roughly half of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=139.48000000000002s)]
*  the cases it gets, the court rules 9-0. It tends to be the more controversial high profile [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=144.1s)]
*  cases where they tend to split. And that's where you get this perception, perhaps misperception [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=149.26000000000002s)]
*  that the court is more divided on the law than you'd think. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=154.46s)]
*  And President-elect Trump has previously indicated he wants to save the ad. This is a reversal [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=158.26000000000002s)]
*  for him as well. Can he? Does he have the power to? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure. I think he said he's going to try. He needs some time to review the situation. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=166.62s)]
*  That's what he said on Truth Social. But the problem here is that this law is a matter [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=171.29999999999998s)]
*  of federal law. It supersedes executive authority per se. And it acts on the intermediaries, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=176.57999999999998s)]
*  the tech companies that stand between users and TikTok. So the App Store, the cloud service [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=182.7s)]
*  providers, whatever you use to get to TikTok, those tech companies will face serious penalties [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=188.34s)]
*  right now if they allow you to get to TikTok once that January 19th deadline comes. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=194.3s)]
*  What Trump could do, for instance, is say, we're not going to enforce it, though. We're [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=199.58s)]
*  not going to come after the tech companies. And maybe the tech companies take his word [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=202.7s)]
*  for it. That remains to be seen. He could also try leaning on Congress to repeal this [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=206.22s)]
*  law. But I think that would be an uphill battle. So Trump will try. Whether Trump will succeed, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=210.62s)]
*  we'll see. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=215.62s)]
*  So, Katherine, I realize that this may not be your particular beat, but do we have an [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=216.62s)]
*  idea of what people will see when they open the app Sunday? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=220.3s)]
*  So I think on Sunday the app will stay in place. We're hearing from the Biden administration [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=224.7s)]
*  that they're not going to really do any. They're focused on, you know, closing up shop basically [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=230.54s)]
*  on Sunday. They're not enforcing this on Sunday and that it's going to fall to the Trump [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=235.94s)]
*  administration. So possibly nothing changes. But if the tech companies decide it's not [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=239.26s)]
*  worth it, then perhaps you see an error message or you go to the App Store and you search [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=246.18s)]
*  for TikTok and nothing comes up. But that's not as a question that comes down to those [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=251.34s)]
*  tech companies rather than right at this point, the Biden administration. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=256.82s)]
*  Yeah, by the administration, which says, by the way, that they'll decline to enforce it [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=260.54s)]
*  more on that in just a second. Catherine Cole, thank you. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2cKz6W7mg&t=265.06s)]
