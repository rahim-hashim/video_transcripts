# Trump team wants Supreme Court to allow firing at agency dedicated to protecting whistleblowers
**CBS News:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10)
*  President Donald Trump wants the U.S. Supreme Court to allow him to fire the head of a federal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=0.0s)]
*  agency that exists to protect whistleblowers. Trump tried to fire the leader of the Office [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=5.36s)]
*  of Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger. Dellinger argued that Trump doesn't have the power to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=10.28s)]
*  do so and a judge temporarily blocked Mr. Trump's move. So now the president wants the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=14.76s)]
*  Supreme Court to back him. We are watching that one closely and because we are, let's [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=19.64s)]
*  bring in CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson. Good to have you with me Jessica. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=23.92s)]
*  The big question at hand here. Does President Trump really have the power, the authority [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=28.24s)]
*  to fire the head of that government watchdog agency? Right. And this is the first big case [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  that the Supreme Court is going to hear on this question. I think I'd like to point out [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=38.56s)]
*  two things. One, if you just zoom out, we're going to be seeing this pattern again. Right. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=42.68s)]
*  So the Trump administration takes an action. It's challenged in lower court. The lower [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=48.04s)]
*  court judge says, hold on pause. And the Trump administration files an emergency appeal to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=53.36s)]
*  the Supreme Court saying, help me out here. I have the power to do X. Now in this case, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=58.72s)]
*  X is firing the head of the Office of Special Counsel, as you said, a watchdog agency. And [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=65.72s)]
*  the question is really specifically under this federal law in order to fire the head, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=72.0s)]
*  do you have to point to bad job performance? Now his argument, the counter argument to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=79.32s)]
*  the Trump administration is in the email firing me, you didn't point to any job performance [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=85.0s)]
*  issues. So you were outside the bounds of your power here. So what's in it for the president? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=90.16s)]
*  Why does he want the guy fired in the first place? Well, I think what we've seen is briefly, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=95.8s)]
*  you know, a vast reconfiguration, a vast reimagination of the federal government and the president [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=101.08s)]
*  what we have also seen is a pattern of firing people in watchdog positions. So Reed, I think [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=109.68s)]
*  we talked about the inspector generals being fired. In my mind, this is consistent with [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=115.52s)]
*  the theme of not just vastly reducing the federal workforce, but also reducing those [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=120.2s)]
*  people who are in watchdog positions. So say the Supreme Court says that Donald Trump can't [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=126.84s)]
*  do what Donald Trump wants to do. Does he have to do what the Supreme Court says? Well, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=133.44s)]
*  that's how our system is set up. And I mean, you've really very quickly gone to the heart [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=138.28s)]
*  of the issue, which is we hear a lot about this question of, is there a constitutional [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=142.6s)]
*  crisis? I will say my personal view is there is a constitutional crisis if the Trump administration [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=146.56s)]
*  or any other presidential administration looks at a Supreme Court decision and says, no, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=153.16s)]
*  thank you. We're not there yet. Right now, what the Trump administration is doing is [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=158.44s)]
*  appealing. That's being part of the system saying, I don't agree with what a lower judge [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=162.48s)]
*  said, lower court judge said, and now I'm going to the Supreme Court. But the Supreme [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=167.76s)]
*  Court has no army. They have no ability other than issuing an order of contempt to make [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  sure that people comply with their orders. We're also watching a judge today hearing [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  arguments over a challenge to the authority of Elon Musk and Doge or his Department of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  Government efficiency. What do we expect to come out of that hearing today, Jessica? So [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  this is Judge Tanya Chukkin. And if that name sounds familiar, it's because she was the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=192.56s)]
*  judge who was overseeing the D.C. election interference case that was pending against [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=196.76s)]
*  President Trump. Right now, I believe the early reporting is that she seems skeptical [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=201.39999999999998s)]
*  of the state's arguments. And again, the states are the ones challenging Elon Musk and Doge [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=206.88s)]
*  and their actions, that she seems somewhat skeptical that there is an immediate harm [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=213.0s)]
*  to the states. The reporting indicates that she's saying I'm going to issue a temporary [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=217.84s)]
*  restraining order soon and that she wants to see exactly how many people have been fired [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=222.48s)]
*  from the federal government. Briefly, something she's going to be looking at is whether or [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=228.28s)]
*  not Elon Musk is in a position that frankly needed to be a position that was confirmed [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=232.96s)]
*  by the Senate, meaning whether or not somebody who's unelected and has not been confirmed [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=238.68s)]
*  by the Senate has the power to do what he's doing. And then separately, there are concerns [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=243.16s)]
*  about Doge's access to a lot of information, a lot of sensitive information, a lot of personnel [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=247.32s)]
*  information, Social Security numbers, et cetera. So I also want to ask you about this because [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=255.16s)]
*  I got a lot of headlines at the end of the week. Over the weekend, federal prosecutors [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=260.6s)]
*  moved to drop those corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. We saw protest [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  people, people protesting and walking off the job in response to this. Is this a done [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=270.4s)]
*  deal for the people who want to see Adams case continue in the courts? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=275.12s)]
*  So the Department of Justice still needs leave from the court under the federal rules of [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=279.64s)]
*  criminal procedure. A court still has to bless the dismissal of charges. What we also know [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=285.4s)]
*  from decades of Supreme Court precedent is that judges typically defer to prosecutors, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=290.76s)]
*  to the Department of Justice when they come to the judge and say, we want to drop this [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=297.47999999999996s)]
*  case. Now, this is Judge Dale Ho. He can, who is appointed by President Biden, he can kick the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=302.52s)]
*  tires here. Reed meaning he can have a robust hearing about whether or not the dismissal is [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=308.59999999999997s)]
*  within the public's interest. He does have the power to say no. Again, Supreme Court [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=315.24s)]
*  president tells him defer to what the Department of Justice says, but I will say it's extremely [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=321.96s)]
*  rare for a judge to say, I'm sorry, no, you cannot drop these charges. You must continue. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=328.28s)]
*  Extremely rare. But you know, these days anything can happen. And that's why it's always so good to [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=333.4s)]
*  talk to you, my friend. I'm just going to tell corporate right now, let's get you a little studio [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  apartment inside the studio. You're not allowed to leave or to sleep. Jessica Levinson, thank you so [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=342.2s)]
*  much for talking to us. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOgNaEZmh10&t=348.35999999999996s)]
