# Trump administration looks to deputize IRS agents for immigration enforcement
**CBS News:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc)
*  The Trump administration is asking the Treasury Department to deputize some of its law enforcement [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=0.0s)]
*  agents to help carry out the president's mass deportation plans. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=4.96s)]
*  This is according to a letter from Homeland Security Secretary Christine Noem, obtained [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=8.92s)]
*  by CBS News. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=12.88s)]
*  The deputized IRS agents would gain the legal authority to investigate, arrest, and detain [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=14.42s)]
*  anyone suspected of violating federal immigration laws. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=20.34s)]
*  CBS News immigration and politics reporter Camila Montoya Galvez joins us now for more. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=24.0s)]
*  Good to see you Camilo. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=29.56s)]
*  How would this work in practice? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=30.56s)]
*  What would these IRS agents be looking for and should we expect the Treasury Department [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=33.76s)]
*  to fulfill this request? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=38.44s)]
*  Hi Kelly, that is a critical question. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=40.0s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security as we speak is currently asking the Treasury Department, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=42.8s)]
*  including the IRS, to supply and allow law enforcement agents within that department [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=47.12s)]
*  to help immigration and customs enforcement. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=52.92s)]
*  That is of course the agency at the center of President Trump's vow to create and oversee [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=55.72s)]
*  the largest deportation operation in American history. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  The specific tasks could include joining ICE in operations to target human smugglers Kelly, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=65.48s)]
*  and also go after companies that are hiring people who are in the country illegally and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=71.44s)]
*  who are not authorized legally to work in the United States. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=75.92s)]
*  The IRS agents could also arrest criminal undocumented migrants in state jails or federal [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=80.32s)]
*  prisons and also help ICE with the deportation process and also administrative tasks that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=86.91999999999999s)]
*  allow ICE agents to focus on arresting undocumented immigrants accused of crimes in communities [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=93.0s)]
*  across the U.S. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=98.8s)]
*  Whether the Treasury Department will actually agree to this request is unclear Kelly, but [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=100.8s)]
*  history I should say is any indicator the answer is likely yes because as you know the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=107.56s)]
*  Trump administration has been moving quickly to enlist the help of agencies across the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  federal government and local and state jurisdictions to have the manpower and resources necessary [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=117.48s)]
*  to launch what the president has touted will be a historic deportation operation. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=123.48s)]
*  That's an important point, will they actually approve this? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  I do want to ask you, the White House confirmed Monday that repatriation flights to Venezuela [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=132.96s)]
*  have resumed, what do we know about this? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=137.04s)]
*  This is a really significant policy breakthrough Kelly because for a long time the repressive [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=139.76s)]
*  government in Venezuela led by President Nicol√°s Maduro has rejected U.S. deportations of Venezuelan [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  migrants who over the past four years have come to the U.S. border illegally in record [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=150.28s)]
*  numbers and the Biden administration really struggled to contain that influx mainly composed [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=155.64s)]
*  of Venezuelan migrants and had to release many of them hundreds of thousands of those [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=160.6s)]
*  migrants into the U.S. with notices to appear in court and allow them to seek asylum. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=164.56s)]
*  Now the Trump administration is moving swiftly to deport many of them. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=169.64s)]
*  Some are being sent to Guantanamo Bay pending their deportation, but today the Venezuelan [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=173.76s)]
*  government Kelly sent two of its own planes to El Paso, Texas by the U.S. Mexico border [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=178.68s)]
*  to pick up a couple hundred Venezuelan nationals and they're now back in their home country. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=184.68s)]
*  And so this really shows that the Trump administration is moving swiftly not just on the immigration [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=190.12s)]
*  front but on the diplomatic front to achieve the president's ambitious border and immigration [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=195.4s)]
*  plans. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=200.56s)]
*  I'm glad you brought up Guantanamo Bay because you've reported on the president's actions [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=201.56s)]
*  to convert that into a massive immigration detention complex. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  This weekend a court blocked the administration from deporting three Venezuelan migrants there. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=210.16s)]
*  What do we know about this? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=214.88s)]
*  And can you clarify for me who is being sent to Guantanamo Bay? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=216.96s)]
*  Because of course we have heard from the administration this is focusing on criminals first. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=226.76000000000002s)]
*  That is a critical question because it is really important to underscore that the court [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  ruling yesterday only applies to three men from Venezuela who are being held by ICE in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  New Mexico. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=239.46s)]
*  It bars ICE from sending them to Guantanamo Bay, but it does not apply to other migrants. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=240.68s)]
*  And so U.S. flights continue to Guantanamo Bay. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=246.04s)]
*  In fact just today another flight with about 15 deportees from Venezuela landed in Guantanamo [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=249.56s)]
*  Bay and now there are about 80 detainees there from Venezuela. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=256.42s)]
*  U.S. officials, Kelly, say that these are folks with criminal records who have alleged [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=260.4s)]
*  gang ties to the notorious Trendy Aragua gang. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=265.44s)]
*  But of course we don't have a list of their individual cases so we cannot independently [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=268.24s)]
*  verify that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=272.64s)]
*  I appreciate that context. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=273.64s)]
*  Mila Montoya-Gavez, thank you. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScqZeOyzuvc&t=275.44s)]
