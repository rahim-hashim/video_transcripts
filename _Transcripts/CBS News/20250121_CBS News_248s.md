# Breaking down Trump's first day back in office and what it signals for his second term
**CBS News:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4)
*  All right, I want to bring in CBS News chief election and campaign correspondent Robert [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=0.0s)]
*  Costa for more on this. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=3.4s)]
*  Robert, as you know, the president wasted no time in wielding his executive powers. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=5.16s)]
*  Does that sort of set the tone from what we can expect from the second term? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  In other words, as you well know, Bob, because you covered it, in the first term, there were [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=15.76s)]
*  people that the president surrounded himself with that were not necessarily loyalists. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=20.16s)]
*  A lot of them had come from longtime Beltway politics. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=24.76s)]
*  Here, the people that he has on his team are people that know what he wants and they're [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=29.720000000000002s)]
*  able to execute them. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=35.32s)]
*  And that's why we're seeing, I guess, this flurry of activity in the early days. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=36.52s)]
*  Great to be with you, Vlad. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=41.0s)]
*  Based on my reporting, it's evident that the people around President Trump now are the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=42.68000000000001s)]
*  types of people who really understand his personality. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=46.84s)]
*  They know that he wants to be in the center of all executive action and legislative action. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=49.4s)]
*  They're not trying to nudge him in any direction. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=55.12s)]
*  They know he's going to take a lot of inputs at time. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=57.48s)]
*  He will make a round of phone calls to friends, allies, different associates. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=59.64s)]
*  That's the kind of leader he is. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=64.52s)]
*  That's how he ran his businesses at Trump Tower. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=66.84s)]
*  When I would go up and visit him at Trump Tower, it was always Trump at the center, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=68.98s)]
*  Trump with many spokes coming into the wheel in terms of the management style. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=72.96s)]
*  And so you don't have a tension now, as you did in 2017, between how Trump wants to run [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=77.18s)]
*  his administration and how others believe it should be run. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=82.2s)]
*  They're all now following in the wake of Trump himself. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=84.98s)]
*  So what other potential actions by the president are you monitoring for, Robert? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=89.08000000000001s)]
*  What can we expect in the next couple of days and weeks? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=93.54s)]
*  The important thing to watch is not just the next few days, but the next few weeks and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=96.9s)]
*  the next few months, because you're seeing this flurry, really a blizzard of executive [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=100.82000000000001s)]
*  actions that is defining the early days of this administration on border policy, on how [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=105.38000000000001s)]
*  executive agencies are going to be run, how the federal workforce is going to be regulated [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=111.42s)]
*  in the coming years. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=116.82000000000001s)]
*  At the same time, the real action is going to be on Capitol Hill. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=118.0s)]
*  And while they are narrow majorities, Republicans still have majorities in the House and in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=121.02000000000001s)]
*  the Senate. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=126.66s)]
*  And when I talk to top Republicans, as I did this past week at the Capitol, it's clear [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=127.66s)]
*  they want this year not just to be about executive orders, but about big legislation on taxes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=131.3s)]
*  They want to cut taxes across the board. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=136.7s)]
*  And they also want to have legislation passed that not only allows the military to have [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=139.04s)]
*  a real presence at the border, but gives a lot more funding in the way Trump wants to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=144.06s)]
*  handle border security. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=148.66s)]
*  All right, we'll be watching Robert Costa for us this morning. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=149.98s)]
*  Thank you, Robert. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=153.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=154.06s)]
*  Today marks week three of Senate confirmation hearings. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=155.06s)]
*  And moments from now, Representative Elise Stefanik will face questions as she looks [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=157.82s)]
*  to become the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=161.22s)]
*  President Trump's pick for secretary of the Treasury and Veterans Affairs are also set [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=165.1s)]
*  to appear in front of lawmakers today. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=169.42s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pick Pete Hegseth mustered approval from the Senate committee on Monday, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=171.82s)]
*  so he secured the position after being grilled by lawmakers about his assault allegations [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=176.2s)]
*  and his thinking on women in the military. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=180.66s)]
*  This happened all of last week. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=183.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump's pick to lead the CIA, John Ratcliffe, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=185.01999999999998s)]
*  also moves closer to confirmation. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=187.82s)]
*  He's a Trump loyalist, and he has vowed to put intelligence gathering over political [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=189.98s)]
*  biases in the CIA, such as they see it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=193.66s)]
*  And Senator Marco Rubio is officially the first confirmed member of the Cabinet. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=196.56s)]
*  The Senate unanimously approved him, 99 to nothing, to be secretary of state. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=201.38s)]
*  Earlier this morning, Rubio spoke to CBS Mornings about what he has in store. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=205.94s)]
*  My singular focus is to ensure that the priority of the United States Department of State is [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  the United States and what's best for our country. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=214.94s)]
*  And that's what we're going to be focused on. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=217.12s)]
*  As part of this transition to this new job, I'm not going to be opining or focused on [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=218.98000000000002s)]
*  domestic politics, not because they don't matter, but because our focus has to be singularly [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=222.5s)]
*  on how do we secure America's interests all over the world. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=227.52s)]
*  My first meeting is today. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=231.44s)]
*  As soon as I walk in the office, we're going to be meeting with the foreign ministers of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=233.0s)]
*  important allies in Japan and India and Australia. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=236.36s)]
*  Rubio also signaled the Trump administration would work quickly to achieve a ceasefire [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35CP7lktH4&t=245.32s)]
