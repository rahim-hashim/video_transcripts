# Texas doctor describes treating measles outbreak in Gaines County
**CBS News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU)
*  Welcome back to CBS News 24 seven. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=0.0s)]
*  Alright, so to New Mexico right now with that, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=2.56s)]
*  states Department of Health reported a death [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=5.64s)]
*  and they say it's possibly due to measles. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=8.32s)]
*  This is an unvaccinated adult patient who passed away [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=10.84s)]
*  testing positive for the illness. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=13.84s)]
*  The death happened in Leah County, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=15.3s)]
*  which is right next to Gaines County, Texas, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=17.3s)]
*  where we've been telling you about those cases, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=20.36s)]
*  that outbreak today, 137 cases reported. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  There are nearly 200 total cases in the state of Texas [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=25.68s)]
*  and 23 of those were infected, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=29.04s)]
*  had to be hospitalized. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=32.68s)]
*  So far, one unvaccinated school aged child in that area [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=33.76s)]
*  died due to measles related complications. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=37.44s)]
*  Gaines County is home to a large, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=40.08s)]
*  unvaccinated Mennonite population. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=42.0s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Omar Villafranca [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=45.0s)]
*  is live in Tarrant County, Texas. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=46.84s)]
*  Okay, so you had the unique opportunity [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=48.8s)]
*  to speak to a doctor there who is treating children. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=50.84s)]
*  What did you learn? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=53.92s)]
*  Well, we just got back from Gaines County late last night [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  and the doctor told us that he has been working [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=58.36s)]
*  with that Mennonite community for almost 30 years. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=60.72s)]
*  The majority of the patients that he's seeing [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=63.28s)]
*  are young children who are unvaccinated [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=65.36s)]
*  and they are of age to receive the vaccine, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=68.92s)]
*  but in that Mennonite community, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=71.04s)]
*  they're very weary of Western medicine, he says, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=72.44s)]
*  so they're not doing it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=75.2s)]
*  And what was interesting is that he was telling me [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=76.28s)]
*  he wants to earn their trust as a doctor [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=78.84s)]
*  so they'll come in and see him. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=80.48s)]
*  It's a community he loves and he respects them. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=82.04s)]
*  And he wants to treat them, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=84.36s)]
*  but there's a fine line he walks. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=85.76s)]
*  As a matter of fact, there was a quote where he said, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=87.28s)]
*  you know, he will tell them about the vaccines. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  He will show them pictures of, you know, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=91.64s)]
*  before the vaccine of children's graves. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=93.84s)]
*  And it was young kids who were dying from this [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  because that's who was susceptible. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=98.12s)]
*  And he says, it doesn't move them. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=99.64s)]
*  He's like, it's like trying to, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  his quote was it was almost like trying to convert [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=102.2s)]
*  someone from Christianity to Islam. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  He's like, it's tough, it's difficult, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=106.4s)]
*  but he wants their trust so they can come and see him [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  for other medical needs. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=110.44s)]
*  Well, people who are not in that community [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=111.64s)]
*  wide swaths of the country believe that the way [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=113.24s)]
*  to prevent measles is to get the measles vaccine. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=115.16s)]
*  But how is a doctor when you have a community [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  that has the belief systems that they have, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=120.88s)]
*  how does he steer them if they're not gonna get [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  the vaccine to try to prevent measles? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  Well, he talks to them about, you know, being aware [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=128.84s)]
*  and being, you know, cognizant of signs of it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=132.32s)]
*  So if they do have it, they can come in [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=135.16s)]
*  and get some sort of treatment. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=137.04s)]
*  And listen, there's been some criticism coming out [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=138.28s)]
*  from doctors of HHS secretary, RFK Jr. who said, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  you know, oh, you can take vitamin A [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=145.4s)]
*  and you can take various steroids and cod liver oil. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=147.32s)]
*  So I asked the doctor about that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=150.0s)]
*  I said, you know, there's been some reports that the cure [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=151.68s)]
*  and it's a cure. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=156.84s)]
*  And he said, no, that's not a cure. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=158.0s)]
*  Should people take it if they want to? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=159.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=161.36s)]
*  If they want to take vitamin A, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=162.2s)]
*  if they want to take cod liver oil and do these steroids, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=163.24s)]
*  he was like, that's fine. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  And he thinks it should be studied more. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  But he tells him it's not gonna cure measles. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=170.84s)]
*  The vaccine is what helps. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=174.24s)]
*  But again, there's just some people [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=175.88s)]
*  who are just not gonna do it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, there's the Texas Touchstones [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=179.36s)]
*  and we're glad you got that opportunity [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=180.96s)]
*  to have that interview. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=182.28s)]
*  And then also the New Mexico Touchstone as well. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  Omar Villafranco, always good to talk to you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=185.76s)]
*  Our thoughts with those who have lost loved ones [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=188.08s)]
*  from measles today. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hey5RegvLU&t=190.44s)]
