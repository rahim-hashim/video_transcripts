# Former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine on Trump announcement of peace talks
**CBS News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk)
*  Back down here on Earth, we're seeing a major shift in U.S. foreign policy with Russia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump says his national security team will begin immediate negotiations with [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=5.12s)]
*  the Kremlin to bring the war in Ukraine to an end. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=9.16s)]
*  This after his phone call with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=12.6s)]
*  For more on this, we are speaking now with former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, William [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=15.84s)]
*  Taylor, joining us from San Angelo. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=20.96s)]
*  We know that you served at the end of President George W. Bush's term and into President Obama's [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=23.36s)]
*  first term. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=28.62s)]
*  So I'm wondering how you view what President Trump said about what he believes would bring [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=29.62s)]
*  an end to the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=34.9s)]
*  Well, I think everybody wants the end of this war. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=36.74s)]
*  No one wants the peace more than the Ukrainians. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=41.260000000000005s)]
*  So if that prospect is on the horizon, that's good for them and that's good for the United [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=44.54s)]
*  States and it's good for Europe. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=49.86s)]
*  So that's the first thing. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=51.5s)]
*  Then the question is how to get there. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=52.5s)]
*  And we've gotten some hints, as you say. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=54.82s)]
*  There is a major effort now that President Trump has described in conversations both [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=57.44s)]
*  with President Putin and with President Zelensky. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=64.38s)]
*  And we know the general outlines of that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=67.62s)]
*  We think we know the general outlines of that agreement that will kind of hold on to the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  current situation on the ground, which is very painful, by the way, for the Ukrainians. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=77.16s)]
*  And they will never, Errol, they will never give up claim to the rest of their territory [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=83.46s)]
*  that the Russians now occupy. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=88.0s)]
*  But they're willing to have this conversation if the other big piece of this deal, if the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=90.66s)]
*  Ukrainians can get some guarantee, some serious guarantee that the Russians will not invade [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=96.8s)]
*  again. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=102.94s)]
*  And that is likely to be a European force on the ground in Ukraine. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=103.94s)]
*  And this is what they were talking about yesterday at NATO. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=109.24s)]
*  Now, we know that a majority of Ukrainians, according to one poll, support reaching a [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=111.82s)]
*  ceasefire. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=117.17999999999999s)]
*  But as you know better than anyone, there's always a difference between what diplomats [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=118.17999999999999s)]
*  say publicly and what is really being discussed behind the scenes. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=121.97999999999999s)]
*  And I think what's confusing some is that Defense Secretary Hegset said the U.S. does [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=125.62s)]
*  not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is realistic. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=130.1s)]
*  So I'm wondering what the strategy is in saying that out loud and what leverage it gives Ukraine [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=133.78s)]
*  to get concessions from Russia. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=139.88000000000002s)]
*  Well, the first thing I would say is there should be no conversations with the Russians [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=143.68s)]
*  about Ukraine's membership in NATO. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=150.0s)]
*  That's not on the table. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=152.24s)]
*  And that's technically, actually, literally what what Secretary Hegset said. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  He said that Ukraine's membership in NATO is not part of the negotiation, not part of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=159.16000000000003s)]
*  the deal with the Russians. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=163.72000000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=165.52s)]
*  The Ukrainian membership in NATO is going to be between Ukraine and NATO and not the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=166.58s)]
*  Russians. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=171.86s)]
*  So that that's fine. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=172.86s)]
*  The other thing he did say was that the United States would not have troops on the ground [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=174.78s)]
*  for this security force that the Europeans are talking about, that the British and the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=178.94s)]
*  French and others are talking about putting troops on the ground to guarantee, again, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=184.22s)]
*  that the Russians don't invade. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=189.22s)]
*  And the secretary said that there would not be U.S. troops in that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=191.58s)]
*  He did not say that there would be no support. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=194.96s)]
*  That is, the United States might well support in other ways that that security force. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=196.96s)]
*  We've also heard President Trump insist that the U.S. should receive some type of financial [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=202.44s)]
*  compensation in the form of access to the minerals which are in some of the disputed [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=207.32s)]
*  territory. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=211.48s)]
*  I wonder what you make of that and what it means for a potential negotiated settlement [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=212.48s)]
*  and its possibility to even happen. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=218.04s)]
*  Well, I don't think that's going to be part of the settlement either. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=220.76s)]
*  I think that is an arrangement between the United States and Ukraine. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=224.5s)]
*  And this actually was a suggestion, a proposal, an idea that President Zelensky brought to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=228.85999999999999s)]
*  Washington last year and part of his victory plan and proposed the United States be able [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=233.73999999999998s)]
*  to develop these rare earth, these strategic critical minerals. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=239.26s)]
*  And that seems to be part of that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=244.01999999999998s)]
*  President Trump seems to be very interested in that Zelensky proposal. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=246.33999999999997s)]
*  That's not part of this deal. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=249.54s)]
*  What that will do is will allow the United States to continue to provide the weapons [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=251.32000000000002s)]
*  and the ammunition to Ukraine to keep fighting the Russians until they stop as a ceasefire. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=256.76s)]
*  So just in our last few seconds, the possibility of getting to a ceasefire and ending this [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  war you feel is? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=269.0s)]
*  I think there is a real possibility. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=273.04s)]
*  I think there is a real possibility. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=274.76s)]
*  All sides want it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=276.32s)]
*  The Russians are hurting. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=277.72s)]
*  They need to stop this war. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=279.48s)]
*  They've got incredible economic problems. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=281.02s)]
*  The Ukrainians obviously want to stop this war and Europeans do and the United States does. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=283.38s)]
*  So yes, I think there's a real possibility this war could end this year. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=288.42s)]
*  Ambassador Taylor, great to get your insight. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=291.46s)]
*  We appreciate you joining us. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=293.94s)]
*  Waking up early there in San Angelo, Texas and joining us. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=295.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=298.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgx4yt2nWFk&t=299.14s)]
