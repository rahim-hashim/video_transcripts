# Latest news on California wildfires as looters arrested, FEMA promises aid
**CBS News:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU)
*  Welcome back to CDS News 24 seven. I'm Reid Cowan. So we are watching in real time these [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=0.0s)]
*  devastating and deadly wildfires in Los Angeles County. Five dead, thousands of structures [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=5.7s)]
*  level. We don't know how many of those are businesses and how many of those are homes. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=12.38s)]
*  It is just too urgent of a situation right now to get a specific count. We can tell you [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=16.1s)]
*  in recent moments, officials lifted some evacuation orders in Hollywood, but many of the people [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=20.82s)]
*  go back to find nothing. They're out of their homes. Just look at that. That is a huge swath [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=26.68s)]
*  of one city there leveled. There are five fires that we're watching now in total. The [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=32.44s)]
*  two biggest fires are about 40 miles away from each other, each more than 10,000 acres [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=37.56s)]
*  inside. So let's start with the Eaton fire. It's about three times as big as LAX. If you've [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=43.6s)]
*  flown in and out of LAX, just multiply that by three. That's how huge that fire is. The [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=49.4s)]
*  Palisades fire, roughly a fifth the size of Philadelphia. Still no containment on those [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=54.92s)]
*  two fires. So let's talk more about numbers because of those numbers that we just told [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=61.72s)]
*  you about by way of just acreage, roughly 179,000 people seeing scenes like this on [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=66.36s)]
*  the run, just like firefighters are evacuation orders. Those numbers coming to us from officials [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=73.48s)]
*  who are watching in real time homes burned to the ground neighborhood by neighborhood. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=79.0s)]
*  More than 1300 structures burned or destroyed. More than 60,000 other structures at this [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=83.96s)]
*  hour still under threat. Some of those by the time you watch your dinnertime headlines [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  will be gone. And just this morning, the LA County Sheriff's Department announced 20 arrests [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=95.83999999999999s)]
*  already made for those who decided to go in and steal from people who had already lost [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=100.8s)]
*  so much amidst the fires. Listen to this. We continue to conduct roving patrols, manning [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  hard road closures, providing security in evacuation areas to prevent anyone who may [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=113.12s)]
*  be tempted, attempted to engage in criminal behaving or behavior like looting. It was [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=118.84s)]
*  mentioned earlier before by the supervisor, and I'm going to make this crystal clear to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=126.84s)]
*  everybody out there. Over last night and this morning, we are up to 20, 20 individuals who [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=132.84s)]
*  chose to go into our areas and deprive these poor people who have been through so much [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=143.4s)]
*  of their property. Absolutely unacceptable. And I'm going to give direction to our department [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=149.4s)]
*  members as you know, when we have an evacuation order by law, if you remain in that area, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=158.52s)]
*  you are guilty of a misdemeanor. If you commit certain crimes, it could jump up to a felony. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=167.28s)]
*  I'm going to be asking our employees to start enforcing that. That is very different than [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=172.56s)]
*  a curfew. Why? Because it's 24 7. I don't have to wait for the sun to go down or the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=177.2s)]
*  sun to come up. If you are in one of these areas and you do not belong there, you are [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=182.83999999999997s)]
*  going to be subject to arrest. And they mean it. And you know, when you hear about looters [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=188.04s)]
*  and you think, well, wait a minute, the homes are leveled. Keep in mind fire jumps. So one [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=193.23999999999998s)]
*  home is standing. Others are burned on a street. What is certain is most people are [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=197.6s)]
*  not there by their homes. And so that means that looters are seeing an opportunity. So [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=202.64s)]
*  that is a strong word from law enforcement. If you do it, you'll be punished. You'll be [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  caught. Now let's talk about the other reality. And that is the fact that those dry conditions [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=211.28s)]
*  can actually blow in flaming embers into those neighborhoods. Like we've said for days, one [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=217.28s)]
*  home will survive. Five homes will fall. We're talking about the worst dry condition. So [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=222.2s)]
*  a lot of people have already lost their homes because of that phenomenon with something [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=227.23999999999998s)]
*  on fire blowing on wind. Now there are human touchstones to this. We wanted to introduce [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=232.56s)]
*  you to somebody that our crews met and very much felt for. 91 year old Dale Short lived [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=237.72s)]
*  his whole life in his Pasadena home. It went up in flames. Listen, I'm going to break down [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  that's what I feel. It's my whole life. Everything was in there. So Short says he lived in that [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=250.96s)]
*  home for six decades. It was the place where his children were raised. Think about the Christmases [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=264.24s)]
*  and the Hanukkas and the family celebrations, the challenges that happened underneath that roof and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  the life planning. But he says he's tough at the age of 90. He will start all over again. That's [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=275.44s)]
*  all that's left of everything he worked to build up in his life. So we also know people are stepping [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=282.16s)]
*  forward. Likely you're seeing on social media people saying, hey, I have a house. Come lean on me. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=288.56s)]
*  And now we're seeing some corporate responsibility as well. Airbnb providing people displaced by [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=294.08s)]
*  the fires raging there in Los Angeles with temporary housing and for free. They're doing it in [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=298.72s)]
*  partnership with the nonprofit 211 LA. And we can tell you right now Airbnb is really focusing on [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=304.48s)]
*  those who have either lost homes or were forced to evacuate. That program is funded by Airbnb and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=310.08000000000004s)]
*  some private donations and hosts who have said, look, we have a home, we'll give a home. So go [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=316.48s)]
*  ahead and offer it at free or even discount rates during these emergencies. Just we see the raging [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=321.6s)]
*  fires. We know the wind that's pushing them. But we also during these times see many people step [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=328.8s)]
*  forward to help our better angels and reminding us that community matters that we need each other [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=334.0s)]
*  and that people are good and the whole community is such a strong one as is. And so as we head into [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=339.12s)]
*  the coming days, you'll continue to watch amazing stories come out of such devastation. One thing I [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=344.96s)]
*  want to talk about is just those who aren't directly impacted by the fire are still dealing [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=349.44s)]
*  with poor air quality widespread throughout Los Angeles though. And as the winds start to shift, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=353.52s)]
*  as we head into this weekend's forecast, they're going to notice it a lot more in areas that haven't [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=357.68s)]
*  seen such dense smoke. So let's start off with the map real fast. What I want to show you is the red [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=361.92s)]
*  flag warning and high wind warnings that are in effect right now widespread throughout southern [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=367.2s)]
*  California. Heading into this weekend's forecast, we're still dealing with low relative humidity. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  All that color down there shows you what the national weather service has issued. So that low [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=376.0s)]
*  relative humidity mixed with these strong winds are two key ingredients when it comes to these [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=379.76s)]
*  red flag warnings lasting until Friday and air quality alerts to widespread throughout this area [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=384.16s)]
*  due to these five fires burning. Some of the smaller ones off into those mountains like the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=389.6s)]
*  Lydia fire and the Hearst fire, but the large ones, the Eaton fire and the Palisades, those are the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=393.68s)]
*  ones that are causing so much devastation. And these fueled, these were fueled by such strong winds. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=398.72s)]
*  As we take a look at the wind conditions, I mean we had 100 mile per hour wind gusts in Altadena [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=403.76000000000005s)]
*  just yesterday. And we take a look at other areas like Burbank, 84 mile per hour winds. It only takes [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=408.40000000000003s)]
*  about a 15 to 20 mile per hour wind gusts for some of these spot fires to occur. And the reason why [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=414.72s)]
*  these strong Santa Ana winds are still lasting into the forecast today has to do with a strong [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=419.52000000000004s)]
*  area of high pressure offshore mixed with a strong low area of pressure just inland. And that together [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=424.40000000000003s)]
*  creates this pressure gradient that allows for those winds to continue to push offshore into the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=430.0s)]
*  overnight hours tonight, early morning hours tomorrow. And this is in dry communities that [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=433.76000000000005s)]
*  have barely received any rain. I mean since last May they got close to around a quarter of an inch, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  but these dry communities are seeing the devastation from these strong winds continuing [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=442.56s)]
*  to fuel these fires. So here's where we're at right now. We head all the way over into areas [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=447.12s)]
*  like Hidden Springs, close to 50 mile per hour wind gusts right now in live time. We forecast [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=450.88s)]
*  about 40 to 30 to 40 mile per hour winds in those exact same mountains as we head into the two [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=455.92s)]
*  o'clock hour today. As we head into the overnight hours tonight, the sun starts to set. Those winds [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=460.8s)]
*  don't die down just yet and that also bleeds down into those lower elevated communities too, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  just along the foothills. We wake up tomorrow morning with a little bit of a shift in the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=470.64s)]
*  forecast though. The winds are going to start changing directions and that's the exact [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=474.88s)]
*  setup that's going to allow for that smoke to kind of circulate its way back inland in areas like Los [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=478.24s)]
*  Angeles all the way over into most of those beach communities too. So lots to talk about when it [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=483.59999999999997s)]
*  comes to that smoke and how concentrated it is right now just along those hills. This is impacting [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=488.64s)]
*  millions of people down into Los Angeles. We'll have more on that coming up in a bit and just how [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=493.59999999999997s)]
*  that's impacting them. But the weather, it's not the, it's those two ingredients along, you know, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=497.68s)]
*  relative humidity and winds. Those are the big reasons why we're concerned for those firefighters [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=503.04s)]
*  out there right now. Just dries things out and makes the situation worse. Jess, thank you so much. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=506.96s)]
*  So we've heard from President Joe Biden pledging a lot of federal disaster assistance to the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=511.36s)]
*  people in California and while the office of the presidency focuses on that state, so also to members [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=516.5600000000001s)]
*  of Congress. So we know this people impacted need major emergency aid and they are going to need it [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=522.16s)]
*  in a very big way. In fact, FEMA director Deanne Criswell spoke about the importance of getting [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=527.8399999999999s)]
*  that aid to the people impacted there on the ground regardless of politics. Let's listen into that. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=533.04s)]
*  You know these types of tragedies that we're seeing right now in California, they don't care [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=539.68s)]
*  whether you're a Republican or a Democrat. All of these people have been impacted and the dedicated [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=545.6s)]
*  women and men at FEMA are going to continue to provide support to all of those people that have [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=552.5600000000001s)]
*  been impacted by this fire or these fires, as well as the work that we're continuing to do in Georgia, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=557.9200000000001s)]
*  North Carolina and Florida from Hurricane Selene and Milton. We're going to continue to provide [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=564.0s)]
*  all of the services that they are eligible for and ensure that we are supporting them through [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=568.88s)]
*  their recovery process. That word going out on CBS Mornings to our partners there, big question [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=573.6s)]
*  for so many Californians, will they get that help? So let's bring in CBS News Congressional [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=579.28s)]
*  correspondent Nicole Killian. Nicole, good to be with you today. Even before the fires, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=583.6s)]
*  FEMA funds was really a major issue and some would say a sticking point among lawmakers. So [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=588.3199999999999s)]
*  walk us through the dilemmas where that is concerned and why some Democrats think that [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=593.8399999999999s)]
*  Californians may not get the assistance or the full assistance that they need. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=597.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, I think let's take a step back and keep in mind that in the government funding bill that [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=601.92s)]
*  passed at the end of last year, there was about a hundred billion dollars that was allocated for [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=609.76s)]
*  disaster relief and aid, mostly in part due to hurricanes Milton and Helene that the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=613.92s)]
*  administrator referenced. But it's a significant pot of money and one that certainly FEMA can tap [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=620.0799999999999s)]
*  into to assist people in the state of California. That being said, Democratic leaders especially [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=625.36s)]
*  have said that Congress stands poised to provide additional assistance to the state of California [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=631.44s)]
*  if needed, if those types of emergency or disaster declarations come in. So they do have some money [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=637.6800000000001s)]

*  more on Congress's part. The question is if Republicans will be willing to do so as well. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=649.6s)]
*  Certainly there is bipartisan concern about what is occurring out in California, very disturbing [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=655.5200000000001s)]

*  seeing as many of these communities go up in flames. So it is something that lawmakers [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=666.24s)]
*  are paying attention to and just kind of standing at the ready if needed. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qFDnFpCyU&t=671.36s)]
