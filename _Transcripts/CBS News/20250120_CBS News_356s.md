# Immigration raids expected as Trump takes office
**CBS News:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM)
*  I want to talk about what's coming up with immigration, because we've learned that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=0.0s)]
*  immigration raids are expected to ramp up this week. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=3.56s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Liliya Luciano is in Chicago, one of the cities expected to be [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=7.72s)]
*  targeted. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=13.36s)]
*  And Liliya, what have we learned? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=14.36s)]
*  Noura, good afternoon. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=16.36s)]
*  What we have learned so far from ICE and from immigration officials is that we shall wait [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=19.76s)]
*  and see. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=25.580000000000002s)]
*  We've heard from local community members, people who own businesses here, from undocumented [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=26.58s)]
*  immigrants and advocates, that there is a great sense of fear. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=31.259999999999998s)]
*  We've heard from businesses who say, look, some of our workers are not showing up to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=34.66s)]
*  work tomorrow because they are in fear of these mass deportations. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=37.98s)]
*  We know that President Trump has said that he will begin the largest mass deportation [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=42.58s)]
*  in American history. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=48.9s)]
*  But Tom Homan, the border czar, who will become the border czar, over the weekend and for [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=50.4s)]
*  weeks has been saying, look, we are not going to do these mass raids that are being reported, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=54.66s)]
*  that they're going after people who are considered a national security or a public threat, and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=61.36s)]
*  that the goal is to make sure that the people who they are detaining and the people who [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=67.46s)]
*  are going to be deported first are people who are under investigation by ICE. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=73.25999999999999s)]
*  That said, that is not what the president has said throughout his campaign. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=78.82s)]
*  So there is a great deal of fear and anxiety in these communities. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=83.62s)]
*  What we have also learned today is that the first order of business is something we expected [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=87.46000000000001s)]
*  because of the way that the president described it throughout this campaign, was the end of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=91.7s)]
*  the CBP-1 app. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=96.98s)]
*  That is the app that people who seek asylum while in Mexico were able to use in order [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=98.86s)]
*  to have an appointment that is confirmed by the U.S. government and make their beginning [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=103.68s)]
*  of their claim for asylum at eight different points of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=108.46s)]
*  Well, now that has ended, meaning that the tens of thousands of people who had appointments [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=114.22s)]
*  and are waiting on the Mexico side now no longer have that opportunity to make their [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=119.78s)]
*  case for asylum while being in the United States, and with that, they have a potential [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=124.61999999999999s)]
*  eligibility to work in the meantime. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=129.98s)]
*  What I thought was interesting, having covered for years the Trump administration's immigration [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=132.9s)]
*  policies, is that without the CBP-1 app, because you might remember the Biden administration [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=137.62s)]
*  had already shut down the possibility for people to make their case for asylum if they [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=143.82s)]
*  came into the U.S. between points of entry, meaning without that appointment, is that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=148.94s)]
*  now it's essentially like going back to the remain in Mexico policy where there is no [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=153.62s)]
*  possibility for people to right now show up at the border with an appointment in between [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=158.58s)]
*  and try to make their claim for asylum legally. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=164.46s)]
*  And this policy, the CBP-1 app, has allowed for nearly a million people to enter the U.S. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=167.46s)]
*  under the Biden administration. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=173.4s)]
*  That is a big change today, as Lillian mentioned there in Chicago, where some of these immigration [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=175.86s)]
*  raids could start as soon as tomorrow. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Lillian. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=184.36s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News correspondent Omar Villafranca. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=185.36s)]
*  He is in El Paso, Texas, near the U.S.-Mexico border. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=187.34s)]
*  And I know you could hear, Lillian, as well. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=191.56s)]
*  What are you hearing about the real-world impact for some of these migrants who are [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=193.58s)]
*  seeking asylum? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=197.76s)]
*  Well, at this point here on the El Paso side, it's hurry up and wait. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=199.56s)]
*  Now, of course, when President Trump was sworn in, the CBP-1 app, which is something that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=204.16s)]
*  migrants would use to try to get some sort of meeting, I screencapped here what it was [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=209.34s)]
*  showing. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=213.84s)]
*  It says, effective January 20, 2025, the functionalities of CBP-1 that previously allowed undocumented [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=214.84s)]
*  aliens to submit info and schedule appointments at ports of entry no longer available. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=220.23999999999998s)]
*  Existing appointments have been canceled. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=226.28s)]
*  We've seen on social media that some people who are waiting on the other side trying to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=228.0s)]
*  get those appointments, they're just in tears. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=231.64s)]
*  They're crying. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=234.28s)]
*  That was part of what the incoming Trump administration, how the president wanted to kind of control [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=235.39999999999998s)]
*  things at the border. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=240.48s)]
*  Another thing that I want to bring up in my travels across the U.S.-Mexico border from [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=242.22s)]
*  Texas all the way to California with the president wanting to declare cartels a terrorist organization, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  I had Republican and Democratic sheriffs along the border telling me they were a little bit [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=253.72s)]
*  worried about that, partially because they're worried if they're calling those cartels a [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=257.36s)]
*  terrorist organization, they're wondering if people in Mexico or living in those areas [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=261.36s)]
*  of Mexico would now have some sort of asylum claim to try to come to the U.S. saying that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=265.68s)]
*  they are fleeing terrorism. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=270.68s)]
*  How that plays out in the court of law, of course, we're going to have to wait and see. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  The last thing I want to mention is declaring an emergency at the border, which the president [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=275.92s)]
*  said he wanted to do with an executive order. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  He wants to send the U.S. military here in Texas. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=281.36s)]
*  The U.S. military, the Texas National Guard is already here. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  They have been here on the border since 2021 as part of Texas's Operation Lone Star. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  As of right now, the Texas government is footing that bill and Governor Greg Abbott here in [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=293.3s)]
*  Texas has been hinting he's hoping the federal government will take over some of that payment. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=298.38s)]
*  But Tom Hoeven, the incoming border czar, has said repeatedly in his trips to Texas [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=302.74s)]
*  that we've seen him that he wants to make Texas the model for what the border should [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=306.74s)]
*  look like on the southern border. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=311.82s)]
*  And you're talking Humvees, you have armed soldiers and concertina wire all across the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=314.18s)]
*  border. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=318.14s)]
*  Greg Abbott is a Republican, but in New Mexico, Arizona and California, there are Democratic [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=319.98s)]
*  senators. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=325.38s)]
*  So how that plays out, we're going to have to wait and see. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=326.38s)]
*  Nora? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=329.34000000000003s)]
*  Well put Omar Villafranca. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=330.34s)]
*  Thank you for explaining all of that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=331.9s)]
*  President Trump promising today to use the muscular power of not only the executive office, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=334.58s)]
*  but to employ soldiers to carry out this immigration crackdown. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=339.85999999999996s)]
*  He will be signing those executive orders shortly. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  And as we learn more details, we'll bring them to you. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=347.38s)]
*  We're going to continue this conversation in just a moment. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=349.65999999999997s)]
*  You're watching CBS News coverage of Donald Trump's inauguration. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=352.14s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcPx1awPiM&t=355.5s)]
