# How will Trump address rising prices as new tariffs take form?
**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ)
*  All right, all eyes on our nation's capital right now, where President Trump prepares [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=0.0s)]
*  to deliver his first address to a joint session of Congress tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=4.14s)]
*  The president likely to touch on those sweeping tariffs and that response to Canadian Prime [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=8.34s)]
*  Minister Justin Trudeau. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=13.08s)]
*  All right, let's start where they're at. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=14.4s)]
*  The White House with CBS News senior White House correspondent, Weijia Zhang. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Weijia, we saw the markets responding to these tariffs dramatically. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=19.72s)]
*  In fact, Americans may be concerned about how this is going to impact their 401Ks. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=23.56s)]
*  A lot of Americans, remember, voted for Trump because he vowed to make it easier to afford [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=28.68s)]
*  things like groceries and really everything else. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=34.08s)]
*  Any word for the White House on how Trump is going to address that concern tonight? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=37.56s)]
*  Well, the White House says that one major focus of his speech tonight will be the broader [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=43.88s)]
*  economy and inflation. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=48.42s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=50.08s)]
*  To have this all unfolding right now, just hours before he's set to deliver that speech [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=51.32s)]
*  certainly begs the question of how he might rewrite or alter his message, because I think [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=56.48s)]
*  it would be a mistake not to address the elephant in the room when you are having these tumbling [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  stocks, when you are seeing people's retirements and investments really spiral, because that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=69.56s)]
*  would be not fulfilling his campaign promise that you so rightfully laid out that he said [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=75.52s)]
*  he would make things economically better for Americans. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  So the question is how he will present that and frame it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=87.0s)]
*  Of course, we know that he has said tariffs are a powerful tool and he has linked this [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  to the flow of illegal immigrants and illegal drugs, specifically fentanyl, into the borders. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=96.0s)]
*  But one thing, Liz, that I think is an important context is that when it comes to Canada, the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  amount of fentanyl that comes in from the northern border overall, when you look at [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=106.32s)]
*  all the fentanyl that comes into the U.S. every year is 0.2%. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  That's less than half of a percent. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=116.08s)]
*  And Canada has taken a lot of steps to try to curb it even more. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=118.91999999999999s)]
*  But Trump has made clear he doesn't think that's enough. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  So that's why we are now locked in this trade war that looks like it's going to be escalated [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=126.55999999999999s)]
*  again because Trump has said, look, if you retaliate on us, that number on Canadian goods [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=131.95999999999998s)]
*  or Mexican goods is just going to go up again. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=138.16s)]
*  Yeah, and speaking of Canada, I want to get back to those comments from Canadian Prime [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=140.56s)]
*  Minister Justin Trudeau-Weijia. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=144.04s)]
*  I want to play part of those remarks and get your take on the other side. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=145.88s)]
*  The United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=149.76s)]
*  closest friend. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=156.84s)]
*  At the same time, they're talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=158.84s)]
*  Putin, a lying, murderous dictator. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=165.44s)]
*  I think that makes sense. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=170.56s)]
*  Weijia, he says the U.S. is, quote, appeasing Putin. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=171.56s)]
*  This seems to be just the latest attack on the administration after that Oval Office [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=175.08s)]
*  blowout. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=179.32s)]
*  Fallout from that still playing out today. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=180.88s)]
*  What's the latest that you're hearing? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=183.36s)]
*  Well, we know that the U.S. has now decided to suspend aid to Ukraine. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=185.52s)]
*  And remember, America has been the largest military backer of Ukraine since the start [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=191.56s)]
*  of this war, providing about $180 billion worth of aid overall, including more than [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  60 billion in military aid. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=202.88000000000002s)]
*  But officials here say they are pausing it because they want to make sure that the money [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=205.72000000000003s)]
*  is going toward a solution. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=209.22000000000003s)]
*  But I think Trump would argue that his tactics are working because we saw an incredibly lengthy [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  statement from President Volodymyr Zelenskyi of Ukraine earlier today. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  He stopped short of saying, I'm sorry, but he did express extreme regret for the way [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=224.12s)]
*  things played out during that Oval Office blowup and said that he really wants to get [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=228.72s)]
*  things back on course with the United States and with Trump. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=234.16s)]
*  He also praised the president's leadership and talked about how, you know, he is ready [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=238.56s)]
*  to find a quick end to the war. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=244.16s)]
*  And so we'll have to see whether Trump hears that message and decides to resume aid and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=246.92s)]
*  also decides to put the minerals deal back on the table, which of course he yanked off [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  after he and Zelenskyi and Vance had that very public confrontation. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=259.08s)]
*  And while we have you, Weijia, you've got some news about a major reversal from the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=263.88s)]
*  Office of Personnel Management. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=267.24s)]
*  What do you know? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=269.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, you'll remember this is essentially the HR Department of the government and it [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=270.2s)]
*  sent out memos several weeks ago, essentially mandating sweeping firings of probationary [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=277.18s)]
*  workers. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=284.18s)]
*  Now, those are workers who have either one less than one or less than two years of experience. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=285.18s)]
*  And frankly, it's easier to fire them because they have fewer protections than full fledged [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=292.74s)]
*  civil servants who have been there longer. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=298.3s)]
*  And you'll remember we told the stories of many federal workers who unexpectedly lost [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=300.78000000000003s)]
*  their jobs. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=306.46s)]
*  But now that HR Department, OPM, has issued a new statement to say that basically you [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=307.46s)]
*  don't have to carry out these mass terminations, that it's really up to each agency to go through [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=313.62s)]
*  and decide how they want to structure their staffing. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=320.58s)]
*  Well, that's all well and good now. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=325.14s)]
*  But Liz, so many, tens of thousands of federal probationary workers have already lost their [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=328.02s)]
*  jobs. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=334.21999999999997s)]
*  And several of them who are unemployed and scrambling to find new work because they're [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=335.22s)]
*  competing against each other for jobs in the private sector. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=339.94000000000005s)]
*  All right, Weijia Jiang reporting live for us from the White House. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=343.58000000000004s)]
*  Weijia, thank you so much. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zv_UYBMRJQ&t=346.42s)]
