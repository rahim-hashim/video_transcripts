# What tariffs could Trump impose on India?
**CBS News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY)
*  Welcome back to CBS News 24 seven. We continue watching President Donald Trump because he says he's going to announce [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=0.0s)]
*  Reciprocal tariffs on every country with duties placed on the United States in his words if they charge us [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  We'll charge them that announcement said to come right before meeting between President Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=11.8s)]
*  A leader that Trump calls the tariff king by the way the US is India's largest trade partner [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=18.46s)]
*  but the US imports far more goods from India than the other way around and that's [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  What we just heard as a trade deficit in 2024 US exports to India totaled about 41 billion dollars [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=29.8s)]
*  imports from India [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=37.0s)]
*  totaled 87 billion dollars, so you do the math the trade deficit stands at 45 billion headline-making dollars [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=38.64s)]
*  President Trump says that's an India's favor, so let's bring in Megan Lenhart Barron's senior economics writer Megan [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  So what goods do we exchange specifically with India because really it's gonna come down to what we get as the consumer? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=51.92s)]
*  And the talks between President Donald Trump and India and other nations [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=58.52s)]
*  It's absolutely true. This is really gonna come down to the fine details and of course we are still waiting on this announcement [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  But when it comes to India, I think we actually get a wide array of different products [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=68.08s)]
*  I mean everything from textiles to pharmaceuticals [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=72.84s)]
*  chemicals even some things like manufacturing equipment and you know the the sort of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  Heavier manufacturing pull from India [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=81.64s)]
*  So this could affect a wide range of sectors in the US and of course we have been talking through [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=84.6s)]
*  The idea that tariffs could potentially be inflationary depending on how their impact [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=90.88s)]
*  Implemented and what exactly is on the table when it comes to these kind of deals [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=96.44s)]
*  But it is one of those things that consumers do need to be keeping this in mind [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=100.52s)]
*  It is something where we're already unfortunately seeing higher prices both [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=104.0s)]
*  You know in terms of the grocery store as well as at the pump and this is gonna make a big difference in the months to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=108.34s)]
*  So when we talk about those reciprocal tariffs and you boil it to the bones [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=114.0s)]
*  We've said this before you terrify us will tear up you right back [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=116.96s)]
*  How will that change this headline making trade deficit between the United States and India because it is in the tens of billions of dollars [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=120.2s)]
*  But how does a reciprocal tariff sort of balance those books or does it? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  It can balance the books of course [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=132.2s)]
*  But it is again devils in the details when it comes down to these particular trade deals in this case [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=134.3s)]
*  You know currently we have about a weighted average of 3% and India's imports obviously, you know [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=140.48s)]
*  To or you know exports to India have you know somewhere in the nine point five percent range [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  And so obviously there does need to be a little bit of level setting and that's what the Trump administration is really hoping for [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=151.44s)]
*  And of course the revenues that could be generated from this in order to offset things like those tax cuts and other, you know policy [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=156.6s)]
*  Implementations that the Trump administration is hoping to do but when it comes to you know [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=164.88s)]
*  The the actual revenues that are being generated from this, you know that really depends [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=169.0s)]
*  I mean certainly we you know when you do the broad math on some of this, you know, the numbers can look very big [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=173.64s)]
*  But when's that what ends up happening in practicality is that consumer habits change business habits change? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=179.28s)]
*  And so many times the sort of estimated value of some of these tariffs in practicality is a lot less than previously expected [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=184.96s)]
*  Well, we know that President Trump ran on the promise that our domestic economic issues would be solved [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=192.32s)]
*  He used to say through that magical word of tariffs, you know [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=199.32s)]
*  But we have people about to gas up today or about to go to the grocery store to fill a bag [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=203.0s)]
*  How can these reciprocal tariffs really influence what we pay at that point of sale? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=208.2s)]
*  Well, unfortunately economists have said, you know time and time again that tariffs do end up being a bit of a [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=214.52s)]
*  short-term and potentially long-term [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=221.72s)]
*  Effect on things like inflation and obviously that affects price levels that we see on the consumer level [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=224.32s)]
*  And so we did actually see in January [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=230.0s)]
*  Inflation was a lot hotter than we expected it to be and was actually a pretty bad sign for folks [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=233.48s)]
*  You know looking to you know cut back a little bit on their grocery budget or you know, obviously, you know [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=238.88s)]
*  Their transportation costs when it comes to gas and things like that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=245.0s)]
*  So we're already facing a little bit of a higher level than we were say, you know mid last year and obviously that does make a difference [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=247.84s)]
*  Now it's nowhere near what it was at the peak in 2022 [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=255.88000000000002s)]
*  For example, we're much much cooler when it comes to inflation at this point [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=259.72s)]
*  But obviously when you do start, you know tacking on tariffs, which essentially are levies or taxes [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=263.92s)]
*  Then that does end up making a difference because companies are getting those inputs [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=269.96000000000004s)]
*  They're you know applying them to their operating costs and then they can pass along those higher operating costs to consumers in the form of higher-priced goods [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=274.48s)]
*  Right and the production index also up [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=283.40000000000003s)]
*  Let's switch gears but keep it down sort of where us regular people are people who are doing those point-of-sale purchases [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=285.72s)]
*  You have a great article today for Barron's [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=291.82s)]
*  Holiday shopping the afterglow looks to be wearing off for a lot of Americans because we're getting that first bill [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=294.12s)]
*  Earlier on, you know right before the Christmas the Hanukkah all of the holidays [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=301.12s)]
*  We said look people are spending more they're charging more because consumer confidence appeared to be up given the election [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  But now you're saying that people are starting to feel that pinch and that burn a little bit [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=313.36s)]
*  What we've been seeing actually and this goes beyond just the holiday season this started in 2023 [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=318.2s)]
*  It's obviously been a trend into 2024 and it seems like it'll probably be with us in 2025 [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  Is the idea that delinquency rates have been on the rise and it was interesting because during the pandemic when we did get those [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=329.72s)]
*  Government stimulus checks when there was a lot of you know free money if you will floating around the economy [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=337.0s)]
*  We saw in you know delinquency rates and debt go way down people were paying down their debt [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=342.04s)]
*  They were paying off their credit cards. They were doing all the right things, which is really good news [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  It makes everything a little bit stronger and a little bit more resilient when the unfortunate [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=351.54s)]
*  You know, obviously other shoe hits the floor if you will [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=356.58000000000004s)]
*  but what we're seeing now is because savings are a little bit less because people are [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=359.94s)]
*  Continuing to spend those delinquency rates have risen above pre-pandemic levels and that is a little worrying [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=365.14000000000004s)]
*  But it is good news to some extent that even though we had an incredibly robust holiday season the overall [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=371.82000000000005s)]
*  Total debt was pretty good and delinquencies were okay [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=379.46000000000004s)]
*  All right informing that conversation when you go for a date you paying your bills [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=382.97999999999996s)]
*  Thank you so much for having that conversation with us today [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jz-BQWtnxY&t=387.73999999999995s)]
