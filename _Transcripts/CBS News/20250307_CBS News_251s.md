# What to know about Justin Trudeau's likely successor
**CBS News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo)
*  Members of Canada's ruling Liberal Party will this weekend select a successor to Prime Minister [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=0.0s)]
*  Justin Trudeau. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=7.96s)]
*  The frontrunner in the Liberal Party leadership race is named Mark Carney. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=9.68s)]
*  He served as the head of the Bank of England before returning home to do the same in Canada. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=13.52s)]
*  And he's seen as the best option to lead the country through a trade war with President [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=19.06s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=24.44s)]
*  Whoever is selected, the party's next leader will then face their next test, which is a [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=25.52s)]
*  general election that has to be held no later than October 20th of this year. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=30.92s)]
*  Mercedes Stevenson is here to discuss all of this with us. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=37.0s)]
*  She is the Ottawa bureau chief for Global News. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=40.04s)]
*  Mercedes, it's so good to see you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  Can you explain for those of us who live here in the U.S., the process by which a new prime [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=45.16s)]
*  minister will be selected starting on Sunday? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  Thanks, Nancy. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=56.4s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=57.0s)]
*  And a great question that actually a lot of Canadians have right now, too. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=57.72s)]
*  So this is going to be the election of the leader of the Liberal Party, which is only [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=61.16s)]
*  taking place by about 1% of Canadians. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=65.28s)]
*  Anyone can join the Liberal Party for free to vote in this. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=68.0s)]
*  It's not restricted. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=70.6s)]
*  And it is the base that selects them. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=71.84s)]
*  They can vote up until 3 p.m. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=73.44s)]
*  Eastern on Sunday, and then all those votes will be counted. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=75.32s)]
*  Because the Liberal Party is in power right now, the person who wins that, who we expect [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=78.52s)]
*  to likely be Mark Carney, becomes the next prime minister of Canada. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=83.24s)]
*  And Canada has an interesting thing in our constitution where our prime minister does [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=87.2s)]
*  not actually have to be elected. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=91.0s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that won't be a political problem for Mark Carney. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=93.16s)]
*  So we are anticipating an election sooner rather than later. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=96.32s)]
*  What should we know about Mark Carney? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=100.16s)]
*  Why is he the frontrunner to become the next Liberal Party leader? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=102.12s)]
*  I think some of this is name brand recognition. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=107.72s)]
*  Mark Carney was a very popular Bank of Canada governor. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=110.44000000000001s)]
*  He presided while Stephen Harper was in power, who was a conservative prime minister, during [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  the 2008 recession here. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  And what the bank did in terms of helping Canadians was seen as beneficial. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=120.28s)]
*  So he's carrying that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=124.72s)]
*  He's also seen as a bit of a steady hand on the tiller and more of a business liberal, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  whereas the Liberals who've been in power here have swung more towards the left, more [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=130.24s)]
*  socialist type of policies than the Liberals necessarily had before. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=134.88s)]
*  And this is a guy who's a Bay Street guy, so like our Wall Street. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  And then on top of that, he's seen as sort of this counter to Donald Trump. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=142.04s)]
*  And that's had a significant impact in the polls here. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=145.64s)]
*  The Conservatives were doing well, but as soon as Donald Trump took power and undertook [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=147.95999999999998s)]
*  some of the policies he has toward Canadians, we've seen a drop in Conservative support [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=151.76s)]
*  up here. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, that's been really striking. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  Does it look like the Liberal Party now actually has a shot of pulling this race off in October? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  They do. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=168.0s)]
*  They have a shot of pulling it off for sure. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=169.0s)]
*  It's a competitive election, and frankly, none of us were really expecting that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=170.24s)]
*  We thought that the Conservatives were going to cakewalk through with a landslide majority. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=173.88s)]
*  That was before Trump. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  And now everything has changed. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  We also expect, and we could talk about this more in a second, but that election is not [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=181.46s)]
*  going to wait until October because the Liberals might want to seize on the momentum they have now. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=185.28s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=190.96s)]
*  So how soon could they hold it? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=191.96s)]
*  It could be called theoretically as soon as Monday. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=196.72s)]
*  Because the Liberals are in charge, in order to trigger a general election in Canada, they [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=200.04s)]
*  go see the Governor-General, who is the King's representative in Canada, and ask for a dissolution [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=203.94s)]
*  of Parliament. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=208.56s)]
*  Mark Carney probably wants to do that, maybe not immediately, but before March 24th, which [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=210.04s)]
*  is when our Parliament returns. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=215.16s)]
*  And that's for two reasons. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=217.2s)]
*  Number one, it prevents him from being criticized as an unelected Prime Minister without a mandate. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=218.2s)]
*  Number two, he rides that new popularity that he has. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=223.32000000000002s)]
*  And then on top of that, he doesn't allow the opposition to make the decision to take [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=225.84s)]
*  him down. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=229.38s)]
*  And both opposition parties have said they will do that on March 24th. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=230.38s)]
*  The Liberals have power, but it's a minority Parliament. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  So we are expecting likely an early spring election here. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=236.52s)]
*  Wow, that's fascinating. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=239.52s)]
*  So things could move really, really quickly. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=240.76000000000002s)]
*  Mercedes Stevenson, thank you so much for the Canadian civics lesson. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=246.36s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=249.36s)]
*  You got it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nG6_o0_jEo&t=250.36s)]
