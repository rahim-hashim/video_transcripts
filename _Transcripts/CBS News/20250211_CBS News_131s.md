# Tom Homan blasts Pope Francis for immigration comments
**CBS News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8)
*  All right, so let's talk about another headline. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=0.0s)]
*  Meantime, President Donald Trump's mass deportation effort [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=2.64s)]
*  getting some backlash from none other than Pope Francis. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=5.44s)]
*  In response, Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=10.06s)]
*  is telling the Pope to stick to the Catholic Church. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=12.44s)]
*  Those are Mr. Homan's words. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=15.84s)]
*  Let's turn now to CBS News immigration and politics reporter [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=18.2s)]
*  Camilo Montoya-Galvez. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=20.6s)]
*  Camilo, what's the back and forth there? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=21.84s)]
*  It's not often that we hear a head of government [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=24.28s)]
*  telling the Pope to stick to his job in the Catholic Church. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=26.72s)]
*  Well, Reid, Pope Francis has long been an outspoken [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=32.16s)]
*  and vocal advocate on behalf of migrants and refugees. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=35.36s)]
*  And this week, he penned a letter [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=38.16s)]
*  in which he essentially criticized [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=40.16s)]
*  the Trump administration's immigration policies. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  He said in that letter, Reid, that all countries [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=44.92s)]
*  have the right, the legal right, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  to defend their territory from criminals [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=48.68s)]
*  and others who may endanger the public safety [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=51.14s)]
*  and national security of people within that country. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=54.44s)]
*  But he also denounced the deportation of migrants [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=57.64s)]
*  and refugees for fleeing persecution and poverty, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=60.36s)]
*  saying that that undermines the dignity of human beings. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=63.12s)]
*  And so, obviously, border czar Tom Homan [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=65.88s)]
*  took issue with that statement by the Pope, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=68.72s)]
*  saying that the Vatican, for example, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=70.28s)]
*  has a fence around that perimeter in that part of Rome. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=72.48s)]
*  And obviously, he's saying that he as a Catholic [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=76.92s)]
*  should be focusing on the Catholic Church [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=79.64s)]
*  and not on US immigration policy and border initiatives. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=82.72000000000001s)]
*  But this really does underscore [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=86.76s)]
*  that there is an escalating feud [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=88.44000000000001s)]
*  between some religious leaders, Reid, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=90.84s)]
*  and the Trump administration over US immigration policy. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  Just today, a group of religious leaders [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=96.76s)]
*  sued the Trump administration over a decision [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=99.68s)]
*  to rescind a Biden administration policy [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  that prohibited ICE and CBP agents [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=105.44000000000001s)]
*  from going into churches and other [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=108.44000000000001s)]
*  so-called sensitive locations [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  to arrest undocumented immigrants. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=111.64s)]
*  Well, and as we heard in the days after the inauguration, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=114.64s)]
*  you saw one of the leaders in Washington, DC, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=117.92s)]
*  a faith leader, saying to President Donald Trump [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=120.36s)]
*  to have mercy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=122.64s)]
*  It appears that there's a direct message back [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=124.08s)]
*  to those religions who have a say in this. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=125.76s)]
*  Camila Montoya Galvez, thank you so much for that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2mkb6tXj8&t=127.96000000000001s)]
