# At least 10 dead after powerful storm brings high winds, flash floods across the South
**CBS News:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw)
*  At least 10 people are dead, including nine in Kentucky. After a powerful storm [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=0.0s)]
*  pummeled through the south over the weekend, you had heavy rain and flash [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=5.74s)]
*  flooding, which inundated roads and homes down trees and power lines left [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=9.56s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people in the dark. Meanwhile, a winter storm swept [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=14.44s)]
*  across the Midwest and Northeast that caused thousands of flight delays and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=18.88s)]
*  cancellations yesterday and forecasters warned freezing temperatures will grip [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=23.1s)]
*  much of the country this week. CBS News national reporter Karen Hua joins me now [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=27.96s)]
*  from Bowling Green, Kentucky. Karen, what more do we know about the deaths [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=32.6s)]
*  in that state? The number seems unusually high. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=36.74s)]
*  Yeah, well, good morning, Errol. It certainly is a very tragic way to start [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  this Monday morning. As you mentioned, at least 10 people have died across [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  the south, including at least nine right here in Kentucky. And unfortunately, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=49.88s)]
*  that death toll is expected to rise. Officials confirm most of these deaths [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=54.96s)]
*  are because people were trying to drive through these fast moving waters. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=59.84s)]
*  Among those deaths include a mother and her seven year old child who were [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=64.04s)]
*  submerged in their vehicle when they unfortunately passed away. Now, over in [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=68.2s)]
*  Atlanta, officials there say a man died after a tree fell onto his home while [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=72.8s)]
*  he was laying in bed. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear says this is one of the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  worst weather events to hit the state in about a decade with nearly 1000 [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  rescues. Just in this weekend alone at this hour, President Trump has since [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=88.36s)]
*  issued this emergency declaration to hopefully get the state some help, Errol. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  And as you report, we're seeing some of the stunning footage from those [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=97.06s)]
*  rescues. I'm wondering, it seems calm where you are. What is the weather [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=100.64s)]
*  situation like now? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=104.76s)]
*  Well, Errol, we're standing at the Barron River right now. Certainly this [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=108.28s)]
*  water has receded, but it still is considered by meteorologists at a [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=112.08s)]
*  moderate flood stage. You can see it's moving behind me and some of this water [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=116.56s)]
*  around has risen to the banks. It is expected to recede today. But just for a [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=121.08s)]
*  little bit of reference, the state of Kentucky typically expects about four [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=125.8s)]
*  inches of rain in the month of February. In comparison, this past weekend they [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=130.6s)]
*  got eight inches of rain, nearly eight inches of rain. So that's almost double [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=136.0s)]
*  in two days what they typically see in one month. Yeah, and the same region was [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=141.08s)]
*  hit by Hurricane Helene or that storm, at least its aftermath not too long ago. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  What are the next areas of concern? I know there were power outages as a [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=149.66000000000003s)]
*  result of this as well. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, certainly. So well, first of all, we're under a flood warning in this [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=156.66000000000003s)]
*  bowling green area until mid afternoon. But the other concern is also the snow. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=160.28s)]
*  It was snowing on and off throughout the night. And so some of these roads that [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  are still flooded right now, the fear is that they might freeze over, which [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=169.96s)]
*  would certainly make it a lot difficult, more difficult for these officials to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=174.6s)]
*  restore power to those people, those thousands of people who are still [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=179.12s)]
*  without it across the state. All right, Karen Hua there in Kentucky just past [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=182.96s)]
*  six a.m. this morning. We appreciate your reporting. President Trump approved [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=187.32s)]
*  a disaster declaration for Kentucky over the weekend, making federal funding [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=192.24s)]
*  available for those affected areas. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dpHjpOpqw&t=196.48000000000002s)]
