# Alexander Vindman argues U.S. mistakes incited Russia-Ukraine war
**CBS News:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec)
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, it was certainly a conversation starter. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=1.0s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about, what happened in the Oval Office on Friday between President [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=3.24s)]
*  Trump, Vice President J.D. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=6.88s)]
*  Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=8.28s)]
*  I want to talk about my next guest. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=10.44s)]
*  He's got a new book called The Folly of Realism, How the West Deceived Itself about Russia [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=13.64s)]
*  and Betrayed Ukraine. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=18.28s)]
*  Its author is Alexander Vindman. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=19.76s)]
*  Alexander, it's great to have you with us. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=24.92s)]
*  I'm going to irritate everyone associated with this show in the control room because [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=26.040000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to read from your book. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=29.76s)]
*  We don't have a graphic, so just bear with me, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  Page 218. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=33.92s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has a notable talent for reading the characteristic tropes and leanings of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=34.92s)]
*  his Western counterparts and ruthlessly exploiting the hopes and fears that to him reflect nothing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=41.56s)]
*  but timidity, indecision and weakness. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  Your book argues this is a long-running pattern that Republicans and Democrats have fallen [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=53.94s)]
*  into and deceived themselves about for a long time. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=58.099999999999994s)]
*  So I think the initial premise is that Russia is exceptional. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=62.379999999999995s)]
*  It's one of the great powers, large country, large military, large nuclear arsenal. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=66.06s)]
*  Because of that, Russia gets treated a little differently. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=71.53999999999999s)]
*  And on that basis, uniquely because Russia has the largest or second largest nuclear [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=74.46s)]
*  arsenal in the world, we succumb to hopes and fears consistently. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=78.52s)]
*  We've succumbed from George H.W. Bush 35 years ago to present day. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=81.7s)]
*  I think where we are now is frankly we're in the massive self-deception stage where [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=86.58s)]
*  we completely forget all the history lessons of the past, the fact that Russia has been [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=92.46000000000001s)]
*  reneged on its previous agreements, that it's promised or over-promised all sorts of different [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=96.74000000000001s)]
*  things and failed to deliver. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=103.34s)]
*  And we haven't even started with the fear stage. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=105.7s)]
*  That's when Russia starts to, some nuclear saber rattling, when it doesn't get what [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=107.78s)]
*  it wants. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=112.26s)]
*  So it's a pretty dangerous place we find ourselves in today. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=113.26s)]
*  And the book argues, and I think it makes a very cogent argument on this basis, that [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=116.0s)]
*  after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine had a sizable number of nuclear weapons of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=122.06s)]
*  all varieties, and it became a compulsion, and not an illogical compulsion, of the U.S. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=129.8s)]
*  administration to get the nukes out of Ukraine. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=136.02s)]
*  Russia had an interest in getting the nukes out of Ukraine. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=140.14000000000001s)]
*  Talk about that and what posture that left Ukraine in after. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=142.82000000000002s)]
*  So I think the fact is that we had a very benign view of Russia at the time, maybe somewhat [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=147.42000000000002s)]
*  justified because it was the hopes of Gorbachev and then Yeltsin following that maybe we could [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=151.54000000000002s)]
*  work with these folks. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=157.16000000000003s)]
*  Add it to the G8, bring it into the College of Nations. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=158.16000000000003s)]
*  But the problem is that the Ukrainians understood Russia, they understand Russia, they've always [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=161.58s)]
*  understood it better because they've had a thousand year relationship. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=166.78s)]
*  For the last 300 years they've been struggling for independence. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=169.86s)]
*  They knew that there was a danger and in giving up their nuclear weapons they wanted security [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=172.34s)]
*  assurances. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=176.74s)]
*  We initially leaned on Ukraine heavily to try to get them to give up their nuclear weapons [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=177.74s)]
*  to Russia. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=181.72000000000003s)]
*  And they said no, just like Zelensky stood his ground recently because he understands [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=183.18s)]
*  the costs. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=188.9s)]
*  This is real to them, this is existential. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=190.22s)]
*  It's only when the US said, okay, well, you know what, it's not just that we're going [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=192.78s)]
*  to ask you to give up your nuclear weapons, but we'll also give you your support that [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=195.62s)]
*  you need to transition into our market economy to help align with the West. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=198.82s)]
*  That's when we got them on board. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=203.46s)]
*  Trying to push these folks doesn't make a lot of sense. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=205.34s)]
*  They fought an orange revolution in 2004, they fought another revolution in 2014. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=207.62s)]
*  They're fighting Russia, a superpower. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=212.94s)]
*  They're not a group of people to get pushed around, especially when it's their existential, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=215.26s)]
*  their very existence online. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=221.14s)]
*  You argue in the book that we also misperceive Ukraine's sense of self, that we think they're [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=223.34s)]
*  anti-Russian as opposed to organically Ukrainian. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=230.66s)]
*  Why does that matter? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=235.34s)]
*  Well, I think for the Ukrainian people, they've been struggling for independence against Russia [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=236.34s)]
*  for about 300 plus years. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=241.7s)]
*  They had some brief moments in which they had some autonomy, slowly but surely the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=244.24s)]
*  Russian Empire squeezed them. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=248.22s)]
*  They had a brief moment of autonomy in the 20th century after the First World War, but [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=250.60000000000002s)]
*  the Soviet Union came in and conquered them. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  They've always had a national identity, a different language, a different culture. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  Frankly, they're just a different people. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=262.0s)]
*  You could feel a different temperament of the populations between, I served in Moscow, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=264.44s)]
*  I served in Ukraine as an army officer. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=268.48s)]
*  For 34 years, 35 years now, they've been existing as a separate sovereign independent state. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=273.0s)]
*  They've hardened that identity. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=280.12s)]
*  They will not be returned to Russian control. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=281.66s)]
*  How about the theory, and I've heard this expressed from several different administrations, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=284.76000000000005s)]
*  starting with the Obama administration, America and Europe will never care as much about Ukraine [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=288.48s)]
*  as Russia does. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=295.92s)]
*  That is true. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=297.6s)]
*  And Russia will give whatever it takes to explore and exploit its interest in Ukraine [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=298.72s)]
*  and will outlast the West. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=305.08000000000004s)]
*  I think there's something to be said about that, but that just means greater resolve, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=307.6s)]
*  meaning that the Russians by themselves will not come to the fact that they're no longer [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=311.40000000000003s)]
*  an empire, that they can't control this territory. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=315.56s)]
*  This is a vital piece of territory that if they get under their control, they are really [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=318.0s)]
*  advancing their empire-building project. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  It doesn't stop there. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=324.04s)]
*  They have aspirations. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=325.76000000000005s)]
*  They've controlled large swaths of Eastern Europe after the Second World War, throughout [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=326.8s)]
*  the Cold War. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=330.8s)]
*  But if the fact is that the Ukrainians have been defending themselves highly effectively [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=331.96s)]
*  for three years, the Russians do not have all the advantages. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=335.84s)]
*  They're actually also—their time is not on their side. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=339.32s)]
*  Their attritional warfare is costing them enormously for manpower, and they're running [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=343.08s)]
*  out of material support. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=346.92s)]
*  If we push the Ukrainians a little bit further or give them a little bit more aid, they're [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=348.36s)]
*  fighting this war entirely on their own, they could break the Russians, and that is what [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=352.0s)]
*  ends Russia's imperial aspirations. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  So when you hear the president on Friday say, you don't have the cards, what does that [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=357.2s)]
*  tell you? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=363.08s)]
*  That tells me that he's deceiving himself about Russia. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=364.08s)]
*  He buys into Russian exceptionalism completely unwarranted. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=366.48s)]
*  He buys into the fact that these promises that Putin is going to give up willingly, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=369.76s)]
*  you made the point that he will not, and that he also doesn't understand Ukraine and their [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=373.72s)]
*  spirit, their desire for independence. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=379.04s)]
*  I think the lesson from this book for me is that we keep making the same mistakes over [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=381.76s)]
*  and over. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=387.16s)]
*  We've attempted resets with Russia. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=388.16s)]
*  We've never fully invested in Ukraine. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=390.28000000000003s)]
*  This is a moment in which we could actually pin back Russia, that's an enormous adversary [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=392.40000000000003s)]
*  to us, and help Ukraine achieve its independence. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=397.36s)]
*  And really, that's the lasting piece. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=400.56s)]
*  That's the prescription and the lasting piece. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=402.44s)]
*  Not to give away the farm, not to accommodate Russia, and to betray Ukraine again and again. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=404.0s)]
*  The book, The Folly of Realism, subtitled How the West Deceived Itself about Russia [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=409.04s)]
*  and Betrayed Ukraine. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=414.08000000000004s)]
*  Alexander Vindman, thank you, sir. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=415.08000000000004s)]
*  Thank you for having me on. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gy4U5m2Jec&t=416.68s)]
