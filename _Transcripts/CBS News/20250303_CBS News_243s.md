# Federal employees again told to provide weekly accomplishment email
**CBS News:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU)
*  The Office of Personnel Management sent out a new email over the weekend that once again [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=0.0s)]
*  asked federal workers to send five bullet points on what they did last week. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=4.8s)]
*  Replies to the email are reportedly due before midnight tonight. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=8.76s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News White House reporter Aaron Navarro to talk more about this. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=12.0s)]
*  So Aaron, what are you hearing from the agencies and how their employees are met and expected [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=17.44s)]
*  to respond? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  I know that Pete Hickson, the defense secretary, did an about face after originally the reporting [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=25.439999999999998s)]
*  was that you did not have to submit that update, that email, to the Doge team. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=31.68s)]
*  Now he's saying you have to. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=38.08s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=40.16s)]
*  That's probably the most notable change this time around. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=41.16s)]
*  The Department of State is now instructing their civilian employees, at least, to respond [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=43.16s)]
*  to this email asking for five things they did last week. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  The last time this email was sent, they told their employees not to. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=51.36s)]
*  We've seen reports of the State Department continuing their stance that employees do [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=54.8s)]
*  not have to respond to this email, potentially out of confidentiality concerns. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=59.44s)]
*  The email this time did say that employees who deal with sensitive info can opt out entirely [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=65.0s)]
*  of a full response, but we're still seeing some variety among agencies on how to respond [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  to this email and if this email will continue. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=76.96s)]
*  Before I got on to talk with you, I got guidance from a Social Security Administration employee [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=80.44s)]
*  who notes at the end of an email from their manager that following this week, employees [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=86.16s)]
*  should be expected to respond before the Monday deadline. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=92.0s)]
*  So again, implying that this could go on for the next couple of weeks. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=95.12s)]
*  I just want to zoom out and also note that this comes as the guidance from the Office [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=98.92s)]
*  of Personnel Management, kind of the HR wing of the federal government, is to have federal [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=103.92s)]
*  agencies submit reorganization plans, plans for big reductions in force by March 13. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=109.36s)]
*  So it's still not yet known what is exactly going to happen with these emails, but if [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  you pair that with potential big cuts coming down the pipeline, it's really notable. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=119.6s)]
*  Yeah, I was just looking through my emails there to see if there was any reporting on [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=124.83999999999999s)]
*  how people at the Department of Defense and the State Department are reacting. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=129.28s)]
*  As you know, Aaron, a couple of weeks ago we saw folks, for example, from the Land and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=134.88s)]
*  Forestry Management who had been fired unceremoniously posting on social media that they had been [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=140.12s)]
*  fired for reasons beyond their comprehension, even though they'd received great reviews. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=145.76s)]
*  So let me ask you about this. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=150.44s)]
*  CBS News has also confirmed the Acting Assistant Administrator for USAID Global Health has [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=151.44s)]
*  also been placed on administrative leave. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=155.88s)]
*  What's behind that? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=158.16s)]
*  Yeah, Nicholas Enrich, the Acting Assistant Administrator for Global Health, was put on [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=159.16s)]
*  leave after, just days after issuing a memo that was critical of the Trump administration [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=164.56s)]
*  of Secretary of State Rubio for their waiver process. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=170.0s)]
*  Rubio had talked a lot about how there will be exemptions for lifesaving care, humanitarian [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=173.52s)]
*  assistance. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=178.88s)]
*  In a pretty detailed memo laying out the timeline of his own experience, Enrich wrote about [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  how that wasn't actually followed through. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  Funds were not able to be drawn, and he really blames a lot of turmoil and the effort from [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=188.44s)]
*  the Trump administration and Doge to essentially gut USAID. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=193.32s)]
*  He pointed to the refusal to pay for assistance and services rendered, said that Doge shut [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=197.04s)]
*  down their payment system. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=202.08s)]
*  And in one notable line in a memo he had last Friday, he wrote that all of this will, quote, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=204.2s)]
*  no doubt result in preventable death, destabilization and threats to national security on a massive [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=209.2s)]
*  scale. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=214.76s)]
*  So definitely a big whistleblowing moment from him in that memo. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=215.76s)]
*  And just days after now, he's just put on leave. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=219.26s)]
*  All right, Aaron Navarro reporting for us from Washington. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=222.04s)]
*  Thank you, Aaron. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=224.24s)]
*  Take care. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=225.24s)]
*  As we mentioned earlier, President Trump will address a joint session of Congress tomorrow [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=226.8s)]
*  at 9 p.m. Eastern. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=230.32s)]
*  CBS News 24-7 will have all-day coverage starting at 7 a.m. Eastern leading up to a primetime [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=231.72s)]
*  special hosted by John Dickerson, Maurice DuBois and Margaret Brennan. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=236.72s)]
*  You can watch all of that on CBS and Paramount+. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9-L3m7kTqU&t=240.24s)]
