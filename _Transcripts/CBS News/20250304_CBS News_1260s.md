# Trump highlights border, crime in address, saying "it's time for America to wage war on the cartels"
**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE)
*  And thank you to John Thune and the Senate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=0.0s)]
*  Great job. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=3.44s)]
*  To criminalize the publication of such images online [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=4.4s)]
*  is a terrible, terrible thing. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=8.92s)]
*  And once it passes the House, I look forward [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=11.22s)]
*  to signing that bill into law. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=13.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=17.02s)]
*  And I'm going to use that bill for myself, too, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=18.02s)]
*  if you don't mind. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=19.72s)]
*  Because nobody gets treated worse than I do online. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=21.22s)]
*  Nobody. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=23.76s)]
*  That's great. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=25.900000000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much to the Senate. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=26.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=27.8s)]
*  But if we truly care about protecting Americans' children, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=30.06s)]
*  no step is more crucial than securing America's borders. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=33.44s)]
*  Over the past four years, 21 million people [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=38.58s)]
*  poured into the United States. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=41.24s)]
*  Many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=42.82s)]
*  and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=47.72s)]
*  all throughout the world. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=51.32s)]
*  Because of Joe Biden's insane and very dangerous [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=53.36s)]
*  open border policies, they are now strongly embedded [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=56.2s)]
*  in our country. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=59.76s)]
*  But we are getting them out and getting them out fast. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=62.059999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=65.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=65.92s)]
*  And I want to thank Tom Homan and Christy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=78.42s)]
*  I want to thank you and Paul of Border Patrol. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=81.74s)]
*  I want to thank you. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=84.88s)]
*  What a job. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=85.84s)]
*  They've all done everybody. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=86.52s)]
*  Border Patrol, ICE, law enforcement in general [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=87.88s)]
*  is incredible. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=91.56s)]
*  We have to take care of our law enforcement. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=92.28s)]
*  After. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  Last year, a brilliant 22-year-old nursing student [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=101.36s)]
*  named Lakin Riley, the best in her class, admired by everybody, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=110.16s)]
*  went out for a jog on the campus of the University of Georgia. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=116.72000000000001s)]
*  That morning, Lakin was viciously attacked, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=121.2s)]
*  assaulted, beaten, brutalized, and horrifically murdered. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=123.92s)]
*  Lakin was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  member who was arrested while trespassing [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=133.72s)]
*  across Biden's open southern border [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=136.70000000000002s)]
*  and then set loose into the United States [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  under the heartless policies of that failed administration. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=142.76s)]
*  It was indeed a failed administration. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=146.72s)]
*  He had then been arrested and released [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=149.67999999999998s)]
*  in a Democrat-run sanctuary city, a disaster, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=153.04s)]
*  before ending the life of this beautiful young angel. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=157.2s)]
*  With us this evening are Lakin's beloved mother, Allison, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=161.64s)]
*  and her sister, Lauren. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=165.0s)]
*  Last year, I told Lakin's grieving parents [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=172.76s)]
*  that we would ensure their daughter would not [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=194.32s)]
*  have died in vain. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=197.72s)]
*  That's why the very first bill I signed into law [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=199.68s)]
*  as your 47th president mandates the detention [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  of all dangerous criminal aliens who threaten public safety. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=208.24s)]
*  It's a very strong, powerful act. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=212.84s)]
*  It's called the Lakin-Riley Act. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=214.48s)]
*  So Allison and Lauren, America will never, ever [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=231.64s)]
*  forget our beautiful Lakin-Hope Riley. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=234.88s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=244.48s)]
*  Since taking office, my administration [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=259.68s)]
*  has launched the most sweeping border and immigration [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=261.84s)]
*  crackdown in American history. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=265.32s)]
*  And we quickly achieved the lowest [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=268.52s)]
*  numbers of illegal border crossings ever recorded. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=270.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=274.92s)]
*  The media and our friends in the Democrat Party [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  kept saying we needed new legislation. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=295.52s)]
*  We must have legislation to secure the border. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=298.04s)]
*  But it turned out that all we really needed [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  was a new president. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=304.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=328.12s)]
*  Joe Biden didn't just open our borders. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=330.08000000000004s)]
*  He flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=332.28000000000003s)]
*  hospitals, and communities throughout the country. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=337.0s)]
*  Entire towns like Aurora, Colorado, and Springfield, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=340.16s)]
*  Ohio buckled under the weight of the migrant occupation [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  and corruption like nobody's ever seen before. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  Beautiful towns destroyed. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=351.44s)]
*  Now, just as I promised in my inaugural address, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=353.8s)]
*  we are achieving the great liberation of America. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=357.4s)]
*  But there still is much work to be done. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=370.56s)]
*  Here tonight is a woman I have gotten to know, Alexis Nungeri, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=375.79999999999995s)]
*  from Houston. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=382.0s)]
*  Wonderful woman. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=383.35999999999996s)]
*  Last June, Alexis's 12-year-old daughter, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=384.23999999999995s)]
*  her precious Jocelyn, walked to a nearby convenience store. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=387.24s)]
*  She was kidnapped, tied up, assaulted for two hours [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=392.32s)]
*  under a bridge, and horrifically murdered. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=395.4s)]
*  Arrested and charged with this heinous crime [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=399.4s)]
*  are two illegal alien monsters from Venezuela, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=401.76s)]
*  released into America by the last administration [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  through their ridiculous open border. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=408.36s)]
*  The death of this beautiful 12-year-old girl [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=411.71999999999997s)]
*  and the agony of her mother and family [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=414.03999999999996s)]
*  touched our entire nation greatly. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=417.08000000000004s)]
*  Alexis, I promised that we would always remember your daughter, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=420.12s)]
*  your magnificent daughter. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=424.64000000000004s)]
*  And earlier tonight, I signed an order keeping my word to you. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  One thing I have learned about Jocelyn [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=433.16s)]
*  is that she loved animals so much, she loved nature. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=434.96000000000004s)]
*  Across Galveston Bay, from where Jocelyn lived in Houston, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  you will find a magnificent National Wildlife Refuge, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=443.44s)]
*  a pristine, peaceful 34,000-acre sanctuary [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=448.84s)]
*  for all of God's creatures on the edge of the Gulf of America. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=454.0s)]
*  Alexis, moments ago, I formally renamed that refuge [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=459.71999999999997s)]
*  in loving memory of your beautiful daughter, Jocelyn. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=465.44s)]
*  So, Mr. Vice President, if you would, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=469.67999999999995s)]
*  may I have the order? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=472.68s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=502.68s)]
*  All three savages charged with Jocelyn and Lakin's murders [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=507.2s)]
*  were members of the Venezuelan prison gang, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=513.52s)]
*  the toughest gang, they say, in the world, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=516.44s)]
*  known as Tren de Aragua. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=519.08s)]
*  Two weeks ago, I officially designated this gang, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=522.24s)]
*  along with MS-13 and the bloodthirsty Mexican drug cartels, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=524.92s)]
*  as foreign terrorist organizations. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=528.92s)]
*  They are now officially in the same category as ISIS, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=532.68s)]
*  and that's not good for them. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=553.68s)]
*  Countless thousands of these terrorists [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=556.16s)]
*  were welcomed into the U.S. by the Biden administration. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=558.28s)]
*  But now, every last one will be rounded up [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=563.12s)]
*  and forcibly removed from our country, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=565.76s)]
*  or, if they're too dangerous, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=567.88s)]
*  put in jails, standing trial in this country, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=570.88s)]
*  because we don't want them to come back ever. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=573.6s)]
*  With us this evening is a warrior [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=577.64s)]
*  on the front lines of that battle, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=579.5600000000001s)]
*  Border Patrol agent Roberto Ortiz. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=582.2s)]
*  Great guy. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=585.4s)]
*  In January, Roberto and another agent [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=588.24s)]
*  were patrolling by the Rio Grande, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=614.88s)]
*  near an area known as Cartel Island. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=617.8000000000001s)]
*  Doesn't sound too nice to me. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=620.9200000000001s)]
*  When heavily armed gunmen started shooting at them, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=623.08s)]
*  Roberto saw that his partner was totally exposed, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=627.5600000000001s)]
*  at great danger, and he leapt into action, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=630.6800000000001s)]
*  returning fire and providing crucial seconds [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=632.88s)]
*  for his fellow agent to seek safety, just and just barely. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=636.2s)]
*  I have some of the prints of that event, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=642.64s)]
*  and it was not good. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=646.64s)]
*  Agent Ortiz, we salute you for your great courage [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=648.0400000000001s)]
*  and for your line of fire that you took [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=651.08s)]
*  and for the bravery that you showed. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=655.24s)]
*  We honor you, and we will always honor you. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=657.72s)]
*  Thank you, Roberto, very much. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=660.28s)]
*  Thank you, Roberto. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=672.6s)]
*  And I actually got to know him on my many calls to the border. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=680.76s)]
*  He's a great, great gentleman. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=685.28s)]
*  The territory to the immediate south of our border [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=688.2s)]
*  is now dominated entirely by criminal cartels [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=691.16s)]
*  that murder, rape, torture, and exercise total control. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=694.24s)]
*  They have total control over a whole nation, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=698.6800000000001s)]
*  posing a grave threat to our national security. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=702.12s)]
*  The cartels are waging war on America, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=705.76s)]
*  and it's time for America to wage war on the cartels, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=708.16s)]
*  which we are doing. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=711.68s)]
*  Five nights ago, Mexican authorities, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=713.68s)]
*  because of our tariff policies being imposed on them, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=727.56s)]
*  think of this, handed over to us 29 [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=732.56s)]
*  of the biggest cartel leaders in their country. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=737.0799999999999s)]
*  That has never happened before. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=740.0s)]
*  They want to make us happy. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=741.72s)]
*  First time ever. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=743.8s)]
*  But we need Mexico and Canada to do much more than they've done, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=748.12s)]
*  and they have to stop the fentanyl and drugs [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=752.8s)]
*  pouring into the USA. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=755.84s)]
*  They're going to stop it. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=758.6s)]
*  I have sent Congress a detailed funding request [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=760.48s)]
*  laying out exactly how we will eliminate these threats [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=763.44s)]
*  to protect our homeland [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=766.9200000000001s)]
*  and complete the largest deportation operation [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=768.64s)]
*  in American history, larger even than current record holder, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=771.84s)]
*  President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a moderate man, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=776.2800000000001s)]
*  but someone who believed very strongly in borders. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=779.12s)]
*  Americans expect Congress to send me this funding [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=783.0s)]
*  without delay so I can sign it into law. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=786.48s)]
*  So, Mr. Speaker, John Thune, both of you, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=788.88s)]
*  I hope you're going to be able to do that, Mr. Speaker. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=793.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=795.84s)]
*  Mr. Leader, thank you. Thank you very much. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=797.4s)]
*  And let's get it to me. I'll sign it so fast, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=799.76s)]
*  you won't even believe it. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=802.72s)]
*  And as we reclaim our sovereignty, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=813.0s)]
*  we must also bring back law and order to our cities and towns. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=820.8s)]
*  In recent years, our justice system has been turned upside [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=833.56s)]
*  down by radical left lunatics. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=838.68s)]
*  Many jurisdictions virtually seized enforcing the law [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=843.56s)]
*  against dangerous repeat offenders [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=848.0s)]
*  while weaponizing law enforcement [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=850.44s)]
*  against political opponents like me. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=852.16s)]
*  My administration has acted swiftly and decisively [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=856.08s)]
*  to restore fair, equal, and impartial justice [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=860.16s)]
*  under the Constitutional rule of law, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=863.48s)]
*  starting at the FBI and the DOJ. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=866.36s)]
*  Pam, good luck. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=870.48s)]
*  Cash, wherever you may be, good luck. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=872.76s)]
*  Good luck. Pam Bond. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=875.84s)]
*  Good luck. So important. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=879.9599999999999s)]
*  Going to do a great job. Cash, thank you. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=882.24s)]
*  Thank you, Cash. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=887.68s)]
*  They've already started very strong. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=889.28s)]
*  They're going to do a fantastic job. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=900.9599999999999s)]
*  You're going to be very proud of them. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=902.48s)]
*  We're also once again giving our police officers [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=904.9599999999999s)]
*  the support, protection, and respect. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=907.72s)]
*  They so dearly deserve, they have to get it. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=910.04s)]
*  They have such a hard, dangerous job, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=913.68s)]
*  but we're going to make it less dangerous. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=916.4s)]
*  The problem is the bad guys don't respect the law, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=918.44s)]
*  but they're starting to respect it, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=921.0s)]
*  and they soon will respect it. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=922.4000000000001s)]
*  This also includes our great fire departments [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=924.8000000000001s)]
*  throughout the country. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=927.5200000000001s)]
*  Our firemen and women are unbelievable people, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=928.44s)]
*  and I will never forget them. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=931.36s)]
*  And besides that, they voted for me in record numbers, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=933.84s)]
*  so I have no chance. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=936.36s)]
*  One year ago this month, 31-year-old New York [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=937.96s)]
*  police officer Jonathan Diller, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=951.5600000000001s)]
*  unbelievably wonderful person and a great officer, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=953.8000000000001s)]
*  was gunned down at a traffic stop on Long Island. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=959.48s)]
*  I went to his funeral. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=962.48s)]
*  The vicious criminal charged with his murder [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=965.32s)]
*  had 21 prior arrests, and they were rough arrests. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=967.88s)]
*  He was a real bad one. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=972.12s)]
*  The thug in the seat next to him had 14 prior arrests [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=974.08s)]
*  and went by the name of Killer. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=978.68s)]
*  He was Killer. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=980.32s)]
*  He killed other people, they say, a lot of them. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=981.08s)]
*  I attended Officer Diller's service, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=984.0s)]
*  and when I met his wife and one-year-old son Ryan, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=987.36s)]
*  it was very inspirational, actually. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=991.84s)]
*  His widow's name is Stephanie, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=995.52s)]
*  and she is here tonight. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=996.88s)]
*  Stephanie, thank you very much, Stephanie. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=998.12s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1000.84s)]
*  Stephanie, we're going to make sure that Ryan knows his dad [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1019.76s)]
*  was a true hero, New York's finest, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1023.24s)]
*  and we're going to get these cold-blooded killers [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1026.68s)]
*  and repeat offenders off our streets, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1029.44s)]
*  and we're going to do it fast. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1031.76s)]
*  Got to stop it. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1033.6000000000001s)]
*  They get out with 28 arrests. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1035.0800000000002s)]
*  They push people into subway trains. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1037.4s)]
*  They hit people over the head, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1040.2800000000002s)]
*  back of the head with baseball bats. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1041.88s)]
*  We got to get them out of here. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1044.76s)]
*  I have already signed an executive order [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1046.76s)]
*  requiring a mandatory death penalty [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1048.64s)]
*  for anyone who murders a police officer, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1051.2s)]
*  and tonight I'm asking Congress to pass that policy [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1053.84s)]
*  into permanent law. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1057.12s)]
*  I'm also asking for a new crime bill [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1071.28s)]
*  getting tough on repeat offenders [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1074.56s)]
*  while enhancing protections for America's police officers [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1076.9599999999998s)]
*  so they can do their jobs without fear [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1081.16s)]
*  of their lives being totally destroyed. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1083.8000000000002s)]
*  They don't want to be killed. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1086.52s)]
*  We're not going to let them be killed. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1088.2s)]
*  Joining us in the gallery tonight is a young man [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1094.44s)]
*  who truly loves our police. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1097.8000000000002s)]
*  His name is DJ Daniel. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1099.92s)]
*  He is 13 years old, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1101.68s)]
*  and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1103.2s)]
*  But in 2018, DJ was diagnosed with brain cancer. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1141.16s)]
*  The doctors gave him five months at most to live. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1146.44s)]
*  That was more than six years ago. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1151.44s)]
*  Since that time, DJ and his dad have been on a quest [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1171.16s)]
*  to make his dream come true, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1176.16s)]
*  and DJ has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1178.76s)]
*  actually a number of times. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1184.76s)]
*  The police love him. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1186.6000000000001s)]
*  The police departments love him. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1188.2s)]
*  And tonight, DJ, we're going to do you [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1190.2s)]
*  the biggest honor of your life. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1192.6000000000001s)]
*  We're going to do you the biggest honor of your life. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1195.0400000000002s)]
*  DJ, we're going to do you the biggest honor of them all. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1198.32s)]
*  I am asking our new Secret Service Director, Sean Curran, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1202.32s)]
*  to officially make you an agent [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1206.84s)]
*  of the United States Secret Service. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9IQvtEhurE&t=1209.44s)]
