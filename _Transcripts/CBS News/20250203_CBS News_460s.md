# How Ken Martin became the new Democratic National Committee chair
**CBS News:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0)
*  The fight is for our values. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=0.0s)]
*  The fight is for working people. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=2.6s)]
*  The fight right now is against Donald Trump and the billionaires who bought this country. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=5.2s)]
*  That is Ken Martin. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=11.84s)]
*  Over the weekend, he won election to be new chairman of the Democratic National Committee. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=12.84s)]
*  Our Hunter Woodhull followed this story very well for CBS News. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=17.2s)]
*  He joins me now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=21.16s)]
*  How did Ken Martin win, Hunter? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=22.72s)]
*  Major, this was a really odd and compelling race. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=24.8s)]
*  But I have to remind folks, this was a race where only about, you know, a little over [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=28.2s)]
*  400 Democrats were actually voting. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=32.6s)]
*  So, you know, you've had more people probably vote in small-city council, you know, elections [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=34.04s)]
*  in some places. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=37.8s)]
*  Ken Martin was able to win this because he's a longtime state party chair. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=39.16s)]
*  He has relationships across the party. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=42.44s)]
*  And I remind people who are saying, who is this guy? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=44.44s)]
*  He's overseen a party that covers a span from Ilhan Omar, a progressive, to Amy Klobuchar, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=47.6s)]
*  more of a centrist moderate Democrat in Minnesota. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=52.68s)]
*  So he's built an interesting coalition as a state party chair, and he was able to do [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  that effectively in this race. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=57.56s)]
*  So what is he, a progressive or a moderate? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=59.32s)]
*  He's somebody who wants to win. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=62.040000000000006s)]
*  And that's the best way I can describe him, because, you know, he can say some days, oh, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=64.08s)]
*  I'm a progressive, I feel this way. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=67.36s)]
*  But he's also somebody who, as state party chair in Minnesota, they have not lost a statewide [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=68.92s)]
*  race since he took over as state party chair, I believe, back in 2011. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  That's a winning streak, that that was able to kind of propel him forward. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=78.4s)]
*  He looks at ideology, but he's all about kind of turning out those voters and making [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=81.44s)]
*  Democrats have the best chance to win. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=85.84s)]
*  Clunder Woodall, thank you very much. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=87.04s)]
*  I want to bring in our political panel, Justin Seife, the Republican strategist who served [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=89.04s)]
*  as a senior advisor to Jeb Bush. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=93.64s)]
*  We all remember Jeb Bush. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  Chuck Rocha, Democratic strategist, senior advisor to Bernie Sanders presidential campaigns. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=97.04s)]
*  Chuck, I miss having you here at the table because I know I'm in the presence of greatness [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=102.04s)]
*  when I see that big cowboy hat. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  What you're doing in New York, I don't even want to begin to ask, but I'm glad you're [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=109.76s)]
*  with us. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=112.92s)]
*  You considered running for the position, Ken Martin, just won. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=114.0s)]
*  What's your takeaway now that the decision's been made by the DNC? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=117.72s)]
*  I was down there on Saturday before I come up to the big city of New York City on Saturday. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=120.64s)]
*  On Saturday I was down there and I got to watch the whole thing unfold. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=126.2s)]
*  Here's a few things that stuck with me, and I've been a Democrat, a yellow dog Democrat [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=129.52s)]
*  for 35 years, is that I would remind everybody that I think there's a little bit of a change [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=133.28s)]
*  happening, which is a good thing in the Democratic party. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=138.4s)]
*  The fellow who lost, and the good state party chairman from Wisconsin, Ben Wickler, was [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=141.32s)]
*  endorsed by Nancy Pelosi, Congressman Jeffries, and Chuck Schumer, and three of the biggest [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  labor unions in America, and he lost. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=153.04s)]
*  That should tell you a lot about the Democratic party, Major. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=156.42s)]
*  You've been covering the Democratic party for a long time, and those are some big names. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=158.68s)]
*  Normally those folks who come together, they don't lose and they lost. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=162.32s)]
*  I think Ken Martin may be changing this thing for a change, not for the better or worse. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=165.95999999999998s)]
*  Nothing against Nancy Pelosi or Jeffries or Chuck Schumer, please still hire me. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=170.08s)]
*  But I will tell you that I think that something's going on in the Democratic party and there's [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  a lot of people that's fed up. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=177.56s)]
*  And briefly, Chuck, that thing that's going on, what do you think it might be? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  We've been doing the thing the same way for a long time, and it's like my granddaddy said, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=185.32000000000002s)]
*  if you keep on doing the same thing over and over again, you're a fool if you think it's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=189.12s)]
*  going to change. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=192.24s)]
*  Got it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=193.24s)]
*  Justin, I want to talk to you about the big headline grabbing confirmation hearings last [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=194.24s)]
*  week, RFK Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Cash Patel, specifically Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=199.8s)]
*  The president was asked about Tulsi today, sitting behind the resolute desk. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=205.56s)]
*  He says, I don't guarantee anything, but she's up there. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=209.36s)]
*  Again, an opportunity to weigh in, to tell Senate Republicans, hey, rally around Tulsi, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  didn't do it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=218.28s)]
*  Do you think she's in any trouble? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=219.28s)]
*  Well, she's going to have a vote in the Senate committee tomorrow, and if one or two Republicans [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=220.28s)]
*  don't vote to support her, the Democrats are united against her. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=227.04s)]
*  I think it's a toss up, quite honestly. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=231.0s)]
*  The president not coming out and giving her that strong backing. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=233.2s)]
*  I think there's some allies of his in the Senate that have some serious reservations [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=236.28s)]
*  of her, and there was a lot of concern about the fact that she did not call Edward Snowden, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  who shared some of the top secrets of the United States publicly, she did not refer [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=246.16s)]
*  to him as a traitor. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=251.6s)]
*  That was a big sticking point for a lot of Republicans. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=252.68s)]
*  The president was asked about that, and he didn't weigh in on that at all. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=253.68s)]
*  He just said, I don't get involved. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=256.68s)]
*  Again, kind of an opportunity to throw her a lifeline. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=257.68s)]
*  One was not thrown, at least to my ear. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=261.68s)]
*  Is that the way you heard it? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=263.04s)]
*  That's the way I heard it, too. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=264.04s)]
*  And so it's going to be up to the Senate. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=265.04s)]
*  And again, I think President Trump should get credit for allowing the Senate to do its [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=267.2s)]
*  deliberative process and allowing them to make the decision. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=271.2s)]
*  What about R.F.K. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  Jr.? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=275.08000000000004s)]
*  R.F.K. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=276.08000000000004s)]
*  Jr. took some heated questions, but I think he will be confirmed. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=277.08000000000004s)]
*  I think he'll be confirmed ultimately. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=280.64s)]
*  There's not that same level of concern amongst Republicans that there was with Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=283.56s)]
*  And typically, there's always one person for every administration, Democrat or Republican, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=287.76000000000005s)]
*  that doesn't make it through the process. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=293.88s)]
*  It's really hard for the Senate not to confirm two nominees of any president from any party. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=295.88s)]
*  So if Tulsi Gabbard is, for some reason, isn't confirmed, I think that increases the likelihood [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=301.48s)]
*  that R.F.K. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=306.0s)]
*  Jr. isn't confirmed. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=307.0s)]
*  You know Susie Wilde as well. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=308.0s)]
*  You're experienced in Florida politics. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=309.0s)]
*  You evaluate her first couple of weeks, not President Trump's but Susie's. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=310.32s)]
*  As chief of staff, so everyone understands. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=313.24s)]
*  Well, Susie's one of her many, many strengths is that she stays behind the scenes. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=315.64s)]
*  She famously did take the microphone when it was offered to her by President-elect Trump [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=319.71999999999997s)]
*  on election night. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=323.32s)]
*  And so I think she's done a great job. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=325.08s)]
*  The president is off to a good start with the executive orders and all the other actions [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=326.84s)]
*  he's taken. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=331.68s)]
*  The situation with Colombia, forcing Colombia to take back their citizens. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=332.68s)]
*  We heard the news today about Mexico is going to send thousands of troops to help secure [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=338.48s)]
*  the southern border of the United States. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=343.64000000000004s)]
*  President Trump is racking up some wins. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=346.36s)]
*  And I think that she's been supportive of the president and his team, allowing them [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  all to do their jobs. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  Chuck, it's never too early to imagine a presidential campaign. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=355.52000000000004s)]
*  You know that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=359.40000000000003s)]
*  The Washington Post had a story over the weekend naming, name checking, 12 Democrats who might [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  be worthy of consideration. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=366.24s)]
*  I know it's way too early to ask this question. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=368.08s)]
*  So I won't ask who's the front runner. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=371.52s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=374.03999999999996s)]
*  But as Democrats try to figure out the way forward, what's the most important thing to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=375.44s)]
*  do strategically and legally block President Trump or begin to campaign for the nomination? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  Major Mearn, you've been on the campaign trail a lot. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=386.28s)]
*  You know, there's two things that these folks have to do. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=388.03999999999996s)]
*  You have to give the American people a reason to fire the Republican Party and Donald Trump. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=390.41999999999996s)]
*  But you also, and this is the part that Democrats have been missing, you have to give people [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=395.68s)]
*  a reason to hire you. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=398.92s)]
*  It's good enough to just say, we thought it was good enough just to say, Donald Trump [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=400.64000000000004s)]

*  But then you have to pivot and say, but this is our vision for America and our vision is [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=408.56s)]
*  better. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=412.92s)]
*  And you're going to start seeing more and more of these quote unquote front runners, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=413.92s)]
*  some of which may or may not have already called good old Chuck Rocha. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=416.32000000000005s)]
*  But let them know that you've got to get out there and distinguish yourself right now. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=419.24s)]
*  Hey, Chuck, over the weekend, Rahm Emanuel, someone I know, you know well, I know well, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=423.2s)]
*  wrote a piece in The Washington Post saying, you know, Democrats love to talk about kitchen [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=427.36s)]
*  table economic issues, but they don't talk about other things that bother Americans, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=431.47999999999996s)]
*  homelessness, culture, crime. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=435.64s)]
*  Agree? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=437.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=438.68s)]
*  And you got to get out there and get some scuffs on you. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=439.68s)]
*  The Republican Party has done a great job at messaging people, making them think that [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=441.24s)]
*  they feel their pain. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=445.24s)]
*  I don't think they feel it at all. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=446.24s)]
*  Democrats have to do a better job of old Bill Clinton looking in the camera and going, I [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=448.0s)]
*  feel your pain. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02cvuZfbG0&t=451.28s)]
