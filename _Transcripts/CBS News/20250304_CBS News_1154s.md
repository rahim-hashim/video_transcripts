# Trump says "America is back," touting accomplishments in joint address to Congress
**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI)
*  Thank you very much. Thank you very much. It's a great honor. Thank you very much. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=0.0s)]
*  Speaker Johnson, Vice President Vance, the First Lady of the United States. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=6.4s)]
*  Members of the United States Congress, thank you very much. And to my fellow citizens, America is back. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=30.0s)]
*  Six weeks ago I stood beneath the dome of this capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the golden age of America. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=60.0s)]
*  From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=86.28s)]
*  greatest and most successful era in the history of our country. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=93.42s)]
*  We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=99.4s)]
*  years or eight years. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=105.2s)]
*  And we are just getting started. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=107.58s)]
*  I return to this chamber tonight to report that America's momentum is back, our spirit [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=128.82s)]
*  is back, our pride is back, our confidence is back, and the American dream is surging [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=135.78s)]
*  bigger and better than ever before. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=141.58s)]
*  The American dream is unstoppable and our country is on the verge of a comeback the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=151.14s)]
*  likes of which the world has never witnessed and perhaps will never witness again. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=156.5s)]
*  It's never been anything like it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=163.38s)]
*  The presidential election of November 5th was a mandate like has not been seen in many [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=169.22s)]
*  decades. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=176.42s)]
*  We won all seven swing states, giving us an electoral college victory of 312 votes. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=178.1s)]
*  We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=192.5s)]
*  USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=215.3s)]
*  USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=222.5s)]
*  And won counties in our country 2,700 to 525 on a map that reads almost completely red [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=231.82s)]
*  for Republican. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=243.02s)]
*  Now for the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=248.02s)]
*  headed in the right direction than the wrong direction. In fact, it's an astonishing record. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=255.74s)]
*  27 points swing the most ever. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=262.74s)]
*  Likewise, small business optimism saw its single largest one month gain ever recorded. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=279.02s)]
*  A 41 point jump. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=287.26s)]
*  Members are directed to uphold and maintain decorum in the house and to cease any further [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=292.26s)]
*  disruptions. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=300.82s)]
*  That's your warning. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=302.34s)]
*  Members are engaged in a willful and continuing breach of decorum and the chair is prepared [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=303.5s)]
*  to direct the sergeant at arms to restore order to the joint session. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=313.46s)]
*  Mr. Green, take your seat. Take your seat, sir. Take your seat. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=333.34s)]
*  Finding that members continue to engage in willful and concerted disruption of proper [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=344.94s)]
*  decorum, the chair now directs the sergeant at arms to restore order. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=352.46s)]
*  Remove this gentleman from the chamber. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=355.46s)]
*  That is Congressman Green, the chair of the House of Representatives. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=363.34s)]
*  Mr. Green of Texas, 77 years old, he is being escorted out of the chamber at the order of [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=393.34s)]
*  the Speaker of the House because he was not maintaining decorum during the president's [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=398.34s)]
*  speech. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=403.82s)]
*  Over the past six weeks, I have signed nearly 100 executive orders and taken more than 400 [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=404.46s)]
*  executive actions, a record, to restore common sense, safety, optimism, and wealth all across [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=411.65999999999997s)]
*  our wonderful land. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=418.34s)]
*  The people elected me to do the job and I'm doing it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=420.58s)]
*  In fact, it has been stated by many that the first month of our presidency, it's our [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=427.58s)]
*  presidency, is the most successful in the history of our nation. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=450.53999999999996s)]
*  And what makes it even more impressive is that, do you know who number two is? George [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=457.58s)]
*  Washington. How about that? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=475.26s)]
*  I don't know about that list, but we'll take it. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=476.82s)]
*  Within hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=482.34s)]
*  border and I deployed the U.S. military and border patrol to repel the invasion of our [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=487.82s)]
*  country. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=494.94s)]
*  And what a job they've done. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=496.5s)]
*  As a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=498.58s)]
*  ever. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=506.26s)]
*  They heard my words and they chose not to come. Much easier that way. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=512.34s)]
*  In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=527.26s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month and virtually all of them, including [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=534.26s)]
*  murderers, drug dealers, gang members, and people from mental institutions and insane [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=539.94s)]
*  asylums were released into our country. Who would want to do that? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=545.62s)]
*  This is my fifth such speech to Congress. And once again, I look at the Democrats in [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=552.1400000000001s)]
*  front of me and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=557.58s)]
*  make them stand or smile or applaud. Nothing I can do. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=564.3s)]
*  I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=569.2199999999999s)]
*  nations or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history or the stoppage of crime [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=576.38s)]
*  to the lowest levels ever recorded. And these people sitting right here will not clap, will [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=583.66s)]
*  not stand, and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won't [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=590.66s)]
*  do it, no matter what. Five times I've been up here. It's very sad and it just shouldn't [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=596.2199999999999s)]
*  be this way. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=603.9399999999999s)]
*  So, Democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, why not join us in celebrating [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=621.3399999999999s)]
*  so many incredible wins for America? For the good of our nation, let's work together and [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=629.66s)]
*  let's truly make America great again. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=636.86s)]
*  Every day, my administration is fighting to deliver the change America needs to bring [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=650.66s)]
*  a future that America deserves. And we're doing it. This is a time for big dreams and [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=663.2199999999999s)]
*  bold action. Upon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=670.4599999999999s)]
*  a freeze on all new federal regulations, and a freeze on all foreign aid. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=677.26s)]
*  I terminated the ridiculous Green New Scam. I withdrew from the unfair Paris Climate Accord, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=687.62s)]
*  which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying. I withdrew [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=694.62s)]
*  from the corrupt World Health Organization. And I also withdrew from the anti-American [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=702.02s)]
*  UN Human Rights Council. I terminated the ridiculous Green New Scam. I withdrew from [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=709.78s)]
*  the anti-American UN Human Rights Council. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=717.78s)]
*  We ended all of Biden's environmental restrictions that were making our country far less safe [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=724.78s)]
*  and totally unaffordable. And importantly, we ended the last administration's insane [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=734.38s)]
*  electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto workers and companies from economic destruction. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=741.7s)]
*  To unshackle our economy, I have directed that for every one new regulation, ten old [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=759.9s)]
*  regulations must be eliminated, just like I did in my very successful first term. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=767.9s)]
*  And in that first term, we set records on ending unnecessary rules and regulations, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=780.9s)]
*  like no other president had done before. We ordered all federal workers to return to the [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=788.66s)]
*  office. They will either show up for work in person or be removed from their job. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=794.78s)]
*  And we have ended weaponized government, where as an example, a sitting president is allowed [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=804.78s)]
*  to viciously prosecute his political opponent, like me. How did that work? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=817.5799999999999s)]
*  It worked out. Not too good. Not too good. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=824.78s)]
*  And I have stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America. It's back. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=841.5s)]
*  And two days ago, I signed an order making English the official language of the United [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=855.78s)]
*  States of America. I renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=863.54s)]
*  And likewise, I renamed for a great president, William McKinley, Mount McKinley again. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=884.78s)]
*  Beautiful, Alaskan. I love Alaska. We've ended the tyranny of so-called diversity, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=898.3s)]
*  equity, and inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=906.3s)]
*  private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=915.38s)]
*  We believe that whether you are a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer, or an air traffic [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=922.38s)]
*  controller, you should be hired and promoted based on skill and competence, not race or [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=940.14s)]
*  gender. Very important. You should be hired based on merit. And the Supreme Court in a [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=947.14s)]
*  brave and very powerful decision has allowed us to do so. Thank you. Thank you very much. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=963.26s)]
*  We have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools, and I signed [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=971.26s)]
*  an order making it the official policy of the United States government that there are [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=979.14s)]
*  only two genders, male and female. And I have the honor of introducing the president of [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=984.8199999999999s)]
*  the United States, Mr. President. I also signed an executive order to ban men from playing [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=1001.26s)]
*  in women's sports. Three years ago, Peyton McNabb was an all-star high school athlete, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=1008.26s)]
*  one of the best, preparing for a future in college sports. But when her girls' volleyball [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=1015.26s)]
*  match was invaded by a male, he smashed the ball so hard in Peyton's face, causing traumatic [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=1033.34s)]
*  brain injury, partially paralyzing her right side, and ending her athletic career. It [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=1041.1399999999999s)]
*  was a shot like she's never seen before. She's never seen anything like it. Peyton is here [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=1048.1399999999999s)]
*  tonight in the gallery, and Peyton, from now on, schools will kick the men off the girls' [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=1054.8999999999999s)]
*  team or they will lose all federal funding. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=1060.5s)]
*  And if you really want to see numbers, just take a look at what happened in the women's [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=1070.34s)]
*  boxing, weightlifting, track and field, swimming, or cycling, where a male recently finished [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=1077.34s)]
*  a long-distance race, five hours and 14 minutes ahead of a woman, for a new record by five [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=1084.34s)]
*  hours. Broke the record by five hours and 15 minutes ahead of a woman. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=1097.06s)]
*  It's demeaning for women, and it's very bad for our country. We're not going to put up [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=1114.54s)]
*  with it any longer. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=1118.9399999999998s)]
*  What I have just described is only a small fraction of the common sense revolution that [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=1136.58s)]
*  is now, because of us, sweeping the entire world. Common sense has become a common theme, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=1140.94s)]
*  and we will never go back. Never. Never going to let that happen. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj2WUxsP8LI&t=1147.9s)]
