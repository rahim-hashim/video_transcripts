# Hamas says 4 bodies of Israeli hostages returned, the final release of phase one
**CBS News:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM)
*  Hamas says it has returned the bodies of four Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=0.0s)]
*  of Palestinian prisoners. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=4.88s)]
*  This was the final hostage release under the first phase of the ceasefire. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=6.92s)]
*  Negotiations have yet to begin on phase two. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=10.84s)]
*  Sebastian Asher with our partners at the BBC has more. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=13.52s)]
*  It looks like the big setback that there was at the very end of this first phase of the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has been overcome, that the last remaining four dead [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=24.04s)]
*  hostages who were to be returned as part of that first phase of the deal are being returned [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=30.68s)]
*  and the more than 600 Palestinian prisoners whose release was suspended last Saturday, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=36.44s)]
*  that they too are to be released. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=42.06s)]
*  So that is a movement forward, but there's still huge question marks over what comes [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=44.54s)]
*  next. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=51.4s)]
*  This was set out as a three-phase deal. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=52.44s)]
*  When phase one ends, phase two should begin. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=56.04s)]
*  Phase two would see the release of all the remaining Israeli hostages alive or dead. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=59.0s)]
*  It would see Israeli troops withdraw fully from Gaza and it would see an end to the current [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  hostilities there. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=68.88s)]
*  But there are still big differences between Hamas and Israel over this. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=70.44s)]
*  The Israeli government essentially does not want Hamas to play any role in Gaza anymore, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=74.84s)]
*  that it must be disarmed entirely and that it must not have any political role, any say [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=82.26s)]
*  in Gaza's future. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=89.46000000000001s)]
*  That's something that Hamas has so far rejected. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=90.46000000000001s)]
*  Those are the issues that negotiators have to get to grips with and the fact that they [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=92.86s)]
*  haven't even started those discussions doesn't raise hopes that this next phase will be able [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=98.5s)]
*  to go smoothly. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=105.7s)]
*  We've already had problems, we've had bumps all along the road of the first phase. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=107.34s)]
*  I think that is likely to get even more difficult as the more intractable issues have to be [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=110.86s)]
*  faced up to as the ceasefire hopefully continues. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=116.58s)]
*  Sebastian Usher, thank you. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAk5SSCtsrM&t=123.26s)]
