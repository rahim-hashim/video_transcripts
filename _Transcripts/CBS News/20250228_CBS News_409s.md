# Rep. Suzan DelBene on Trump-Zelenskyy meeting, potential Medicaid cuts and more
**CBS News:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8)
*  House Republicans [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=0.0s)]
*  Passed the budget resolution that sets in motion the largest [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=1.72s)]
*  Medicaid cut in American history [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=7.68s)]
*  Children will be devastated [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=12.64s)]
*  So I know this is a somewhat jarring turn [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=15.44s)]
*  But we're gonna go from rare earth minerals to Medicaid and its future that was house minority leader Hakeem Jeffries [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=17.48s)]
*  Today on the budget resolution house Republicans passed earlier this week [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=22.84s)]
*  I want to bring in Washington Democratic Congresswoman and chair of the Democratic Congressional [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=26.82s)]
*  campaign committee Susan DelBene will get to Medicaid in a second Congresswoman, but [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=30.82s)]
*  the Trump administration through senior officials talking to us is blaming Zelensky and his [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=36.260000000000005s)]
*  Obstructionist attitude for the blow-up today. What is your perspective? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=42.660000000000004s)]
*  You know what we saw from the president from the vice president was a disgrace here. We have [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=46.260000000000005s)]
*  Ukraine is an ally they're fighting for their democracy for their freedom [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=51.86s)]
*  and instead of supporting them we have a [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=57.82s)]
*  President a vice president who are petty and small and even Ronald Reagan would be horrified by what he saw in the White House today [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=61.5s)]
*  What do you think the implications of it are? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=68.94s)]
*  Well, I think it puts [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=71.94s)]
*  It's a very dangerous situation. We should be standing by our allies [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=74.38s)]
*  and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=79.7s)]
*  It's just disgraceful and shameful what we saw at the White House [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=81.46000000000001s)]
*  So Hakeem Jeffries and plenty of other Democrats have identified issues with the House Republican [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=85.62s)]
*  budget resolution which sends instructions to the Energy and Commerce Committee to look for somewhere in the range of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=91.82000000000001s)]
*  880 billion dollars in reductions to future Medicaid spending as you know [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=98.38s)]
*  Congresswoman Medicaid spending has been going up and up and up at a faster rate than Social Security and Medicare [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=103.62s)]
*  There are bipartisan analysts who've looked at that and said there are ways to save within Medicaid that do not necessarily would not necessarily [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=109.62s)]
*  Have to harm [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=116.98s)]
*  Beneficiaries directly are Democrats open to any of those reforms or is there political posture going to be you can't touch it at all [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=118.74000000000001s)]
*  Well, you know, I think budget is a reflection of your values and we saw that in the Republican budget [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=126.74000000000001s)]
*  They weren't focused on working families or helping children or seniors or veterans [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=133.02s)]
*  There one focus was tax cuts for the wealthiest and the well-connected and when you look at the cuts that they propose [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=138.29999999999998s)]
*  They're not talking about small changes. They're talking about slashing Medicaid [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=146.26s)]
*  Taking people off of health care and if we're talking about lowering costs, which this last election was all about [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=151.38s)]
*  They're doing nothing to Republicans are doing nothing to lower costs. It hasn't have been a priority [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=157.62s)]
*  This would raise costs for working families. So absolutely the Republican budget is [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=162.73999999999998s)]
*  not a reflection of what the American people want to see and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=169.57999999999998s)]
*  Just so disappointing and that's why you see so many people speaking loudly [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=173.17999999999998s)]
*  We should be fighting to lower costs and absolutely make sure people have affordable quality health care all across the country [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=177.29999999999998s)]
*  The D triple C which you lead and other Democratic organizations filed a lawsuit against the president's recent [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=183.85999999999999s)]
*  Executive actions to take over the Federal Elections Commission. What's that about? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=190.4s)]
*  Well, you know the Federal Election Commission supposed to be independent Commission [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=194.8s)]
*  Making sure that folks are following the laws so that we have free and fair elections [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=199.44s)]
*  The president is basically saying he wants to control that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  And that has nothing to do with free and fair elections that has to do with him wanting to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=207.32000000000002s)]
*  Be able to say things should be done in a way that he wants. He is not an independent [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=212.52s)]
*  Non-partisan person to be in charge there. So we think that Federal Elections Commission should be an independent Commission [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=217.72s)]
*  It should be upholding [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=224.6s)]
*  Election laws that have been put in place [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=226.12s)]
*  What are your concerns to the degree you have them Congresswoman about the efforts so far of the Department of Government Efficiency? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=228.44s)]
*  And have you heard from constituents because we've been picking this up in town halls across the country that alarmed [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=234.52s)]
*  Either federal workers or their family members or those who are supported by the salaries of those federal workers [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  Simply do not believe Democrats in Congress are sounding enough of an alarm or doing enough to reverse this [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=246.84s)]
*  Well, I think you're hearing from folks across the country because the impacts of what's happening with the executive orders from President Trump [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=253.12s)]
*  But kind of the kind of reckless [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=260.76s)]
*  impact of Elon Musk [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  Indiscriminately firing people and the federal government [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=266.6s)]
*  I mean we basically see the beginnings of a government shutdown right now between President Trump and Elon Musk [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=269.16s)]
*  The concerns are felt all across the country because they're threatening our public health our public safety [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=276.64s)]
*  We see workers being cut even bird flu inspectors at a time where this is an important issue [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  And they don't know what they're doing where they fire people and they say oh, maybe we need to bring these people back [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=288.84s)]
*  This has nothing to do with saving money or efficiency [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=294.4s)]
*  It's chaos it its dysfunction and and people are speaking out [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=297.84s)]
*  I had a town hall recently we had over 14,000 people on our telephone town hall, you know [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=303.76000000000005s)]
*  Normally a strong showing might be 2000 [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=309.32000000000005s)]
*  Will Democrats in negotiations and there must be negotiations to avert a government shutdown midway through March [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=312.6s)]
*  Seek legislative language to reverse efforts undertaken by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=319.6s)]
*  Well, let's be clear Congress controls the purse. And so what's very important is that we put together [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=326.76000000000005s)]
*  What program should be funded how money should be spent and the administration needs to follow that that's the law and [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=333.88000000000005s)]
*  And right now we see Republicans wanting to give [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=341.8s)]
*  Elon Musk more kind of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=345.48s)]
*  Authority to indiscriminately decide where money goes that won't work and we need Republicans and the administration to follow the law [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=347.64000000000004s)]
*  That's what we're going to focus on [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=355.16s)]
*  It's very important that we have government working for the people and we're going to continue to fight for that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=356.76000000000005s)]
*  Very quickly the midterms are a while away [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=363.8s)]
*  But do you believe Republicans will be running on government of efficiency cuts or Democrats running against them? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=365.8s)]
*  Come midterm election time [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=373.24s)]
*  I think we're seeing the chaos and dysfunction and the broken promises from Republicans right now [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=375.32000000000005s)]
*  And they're going to be accountable for that in the next election [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=381.24s)]
*  They are breaking promises by raising costs for working families. They said that that was their focus [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=384.52000000000004s)]
*  Clearly it's not the chaos the dysfunction not standing up for working families [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=390.6s)]
*  That's going to be what American people are going to be thinking about when they're at the ballot box [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=395.64s)]
*  And that's why you'll see us taking back the majority in the House of Representatives in 2026 [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=399.8s)]
*  We shall see congresswoman Susan DelBene. Thank you very much for your time [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0DHJsRNP8&t=405.56s)]
