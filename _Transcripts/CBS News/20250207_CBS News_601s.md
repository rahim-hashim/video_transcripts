# Trump appears to support Musk's DOGE accessing Americans' personal data
**CBS News:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8)
*  President Trump met with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba at the White House today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=0.0s)]
*  At a joint press conference this afternoon, President Trump revealed that Japan will be [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=5.92s)]
*  investing heavily in American company U.S. Steel instead of Japanese company Nippon Steel [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=9.26s)]
*  taking it over. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=15.16s)]
*  And nearly all of USAID is being laid off today, leaving thousands of workers around [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=16.76s)]
*  the world without a job. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=21.14s)]
*  The Trump administration ordered the dismantling of nearly the entire agency. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=22.6s)]
*  Fewer than 300 employees out of thousands of direct hires and contractors are expected [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=26.8s)]
*  to be exempt from the leave and furloughs. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  USAID personnel overseas were given 30 days to return to the U.S. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=34.56s)]
*  Unions at USAID are suing the administration to halt the efforts. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=39.2s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News Chief White House correspondent Nancy Cortez. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=43.64s)]
*  Nancy, the president making news again twice this week from the podium, this time in terms [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=46.84s)]
*  of that U.S. Nippon Steel deal. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=54.63999999999999s)]
*  And we're still waiting for the particulars, Lindsay, because what the president said in [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=55.63999999999999s)]
*  that press conference is that psychologically it's not a good concept for a Japanese company [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=59.4s)]
*  or any foreign company to come in and buy U.S. Steel, a company that he sees as so foundational [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=66.72s)]
*  to the U.S. identity. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=74.4s)]
*  And so therefore he said that what he had worked out was an investment by Nippon Steel [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=77.08s)]
*  in U.S. Steel instead. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=83.42s)]
*  What exactly that means, how that would differ from the ownership offer that has already [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=86.10000000000001s)]
*  been discussed for years remains to be seen. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=90.98s)]
*  We didn't get any details out of that press conference. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=93.78s)]
*  But that is fascinating because as we've been covering this story both throughout the Biden [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=96.42s)]
*  administration now into the Trump administration, one of the things that U.S. Steel has said [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=100.98s)]
*  is that if they don't get this cash infusion from Nippon Steel, that they will have to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=106.02000000000001s)]
*  lay off U.S. workers. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=109.9s)]
*  When the president was asked, is this a restructuring of the deal, he said it's investment, no longer [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=112.38s)]
*  a purchase. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=116.25999999999999s)]
*  He said he didn't want to do a purchase, but an investment. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=117.25999999999999s)]
*  I love that from the president. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=119.38s)]
*  Nancy, what did you take? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=121.06s)]
*  I'm guessing you have more calendar notes for Monday and Tuesday of next week in terms [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=122.42s)]
*  of these reciprocal tariffs. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=127.14s)]
*  What are you expecting in terms of that? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=128.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=130.74s)]
*  So that was one thing that President Trump said is that he's interested in reciprocal [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=131.74s)]
*  tariffs, apparently where the U.S. imposes tariffs on other countries and they impose [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=134.98s)]
*  tariffs in turn on the U.S. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=140.22s)]
*  What that would mean financially for both countries is kind of up in the air. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=142.89999999999998s)]
*  It was interesting when the Japanese prime minister was asked whether he would retaliate [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=147.14s)]
*  if the U.S. does indeed place tariffs on Japanese goods. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=152.05999999999997s)]
*  He gave a very carefully worded answer. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=156.73999999999998s)]
*  He said that I'm unable to answer a hypothetical question. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=159.89999999999998s)]
*  That's my official response. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=164.38s)]
*  And that actually drew laughter from the room. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=165.94s)]
*  Even President Trump seemed to approve of how carefully he was avoiding any type of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=168.46s)]
*  conflict with the president of the United States while they were standing side by side. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=174.66s)]
*  Nancy, you're also tracking developments with USAID. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=178.82s)]
*  Nearly all staff for the humanitarian aid group will be placed on leave by tonight. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=181.58s)]
*  What's the latest there? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=186.02s)]
*  Well, President Trump once again argued without proof that all of the payments that were being [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=187.34s)]
*  made by USAID were fraudulent and that the agency needs to more or less be shut down. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=193.57999999999998s)]
*  The White House has yet to provide evidence that USAID is involved in fraud. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=201.06s)]
*  In fact, in the previous Trump administration, both the president's daughter, Ivanka Trump, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=206.14s)]
*  and Melania Trump, his wife, were involved with USAID in various projects. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=212.01999999999998s)]
*  And the current U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been arguing for years before he [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=217.01999999999998s)]
*  took his current position that USAID was so important that it actually needed more funding, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=222.54000000000002s)]
*  not less. So this is a remarkable turnaround for President Trump. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=228.38s)]
*  He was asked a few times about Elon Musk and his Doge operation. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=231.82s)]
*  Elon Musk has also been slamming USAID any chance he gets. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=237.9s)]
*  President Trump was asked if there is anything that he has told Elon Musk not to do or that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=243.38s)]
*  he is not allowed to look into. And the president notably wasn't able to come up with anything. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=250.82000000000002s)]
*  He said he directs Elon Musk on where to go and where to find cuts. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=258.02s)]
*  And Elon follows through very quickly. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=264.1s)]
*  He was also asked, interestingly, at one point, whether why it was necessary for Doge to get [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=267.7s)]
*  access to personal information, reportedly things like Social Security numbers and bank accounts. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=273.86s)]
*  And he said, well, they don't need it, but it's so easy for them to get because our security [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=279.62s)]
*  systems are so bad. So not only did he not seem to have a problem with Doge getting access to [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=285.3s)]
*  Americans' private information, but he essentially suggested that it's kind of what Americans [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=293.38s)]
*  deserve, given the security that surrounds our private information when it's in government [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=299.22s)]
*  computers. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=307.38s)]
*  So clearly more questions there as well. Nancy Cortez, thank you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=308.1s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News. Chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett. So, Major, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=310.90000000000003s)]
*  what would be the significance? And I know we don't know any of the specifics of this [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=315.54s)]
*  Japanese investment into U.S. deal, but what would the significance of that be instead of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=320.58000000000004s)]
*  a takeover? And take us back a little bit about why the Biden administration first blocked that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=324.42s)]
*  acquisition. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=328.98s)]
*  Lindsay, I promise I will get to that in just a second. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=329.78000000000003s)]
*  Yes, you have it all on top of that personal information, so go for it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=331.78000000000003s)]
*  But please, let's go back to what Nancy just said. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=335.14000000000004s)]
*  She accurately quoted the president of the United States saying it was so easy for Elon Musk's [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=338.1s)]
*  associates operating under the Doge imprimatur from the White House to get access because our [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=343.70000000000005s)]
*  security is weak. That's not what happened. They were sent to these various federal agencies and [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=350.58000000000004s)]
*  they plugged themselves in to the systems under the order of the president of the United States. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=357.38s)]
*  That may or may not be legal. There will be lawsuits about that. But it's not because there [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=364.58s)]
*  was a cybersecurity failure. The president of the United States, through an executive order, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=369.21999999999997s)]
*  sent them to these agencies. They plugged in with servers we don't know the underlying security of [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=373.78s)]
*  those. So if there's a security compromise, Lindsay, it's not within the apparatus at the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=379.38s)]
*  agencies. It might be with the apparatus that was plugged into it at the direction of this president. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=385.3s)]
*  Let's just clarify that right straight up at the top. Now, U.S. Steel, Nippon. There is a committee [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=390.58s)]
*  in the Treasury Department called Committee on Foreign Investment of the United States. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=396.97999999999996s)]
*  The acronym here is CFIUS. CFIUS can block a transaction like this if it finds there are [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=400.82s)]
*  national security implications, meaning the national security of the United States would [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=407.14s)]
*  be threatened by this foreign ownership. Late in the Biden administration, that committee was [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=410.9s)]
*  deadlocked. They could not resolve whether or not Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=417.06s)]
*  would in fact constitute an undercutting of U.S. national security. President Biden said, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=421.38s)]
*  I'll make up my mind myself, said it is and blocked it. That's the only way this can be blocked [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=426.42s)]
*  legally in our country. And there is a lawsuit pending right now from Nippon Steel and U.S. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=431.38s)]
*  Steel saying that decision broke the law and cannot be defended in court. What this discussion [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=437.62s)]
*  that President Trump just had in full public view about investment, not acquisition, means to that, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=444.02s)]
*  I have no clue because the president did not specify it at all and significantly the Japanese [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=448.97999999999996s)]
*  prime minister did not say a word about it. So I think this is an open question. And just for the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=453.7s)]
*  audience's benefit, there already is this whole transaction is based on Nippon Steel investing [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=460.26s)]
*  substantial sums into U.S. Steel because it's aging blast furnaces located in two states, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=466.74s)]
*  Pennsylvania and Indiana, are costly and union supervised. If there is not that infusion of cash, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=473.06s)]
*  as Nancy indicated, those might have to close, costing U.S. Steel workers their jobs. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=478.9s)]
*  So this already is an investment process. The acquisition is. And what President Trump is saying, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=484.58s)]
*  I don't like the idea of U.S. Steel being anything other than U.S. Steel. That can probably be worked [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=490.34000000000003s)]
*  out. And Nippon Steel has already agreed to say the United States and the federal government can [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=496.1s)]
*  dictate future production out of any U.S. Steel property. So Nippon Steel has already conceded a [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=502.42s)]
*  lot of terrain, hoping to get President Trump's approval. It's now very much an open question. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=508.26s)]
*  And our audience will have to forgive us for ping ponging around, but this is where we find ourselves. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=515.62s)]
*  The president was asked about whether he intends to fire the FBI agents who filled out the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=519.14s)]
*  questionnaire saying affirmatively that they worked on January six cases. He said, I'll fire [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=523.54s)]
*  some of them. Some were corrupt, but we will be bringing back the reputation of the FBI. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=528.4200000000001s)]
*  What's the latest there? Because it's my understanding the DOJ has employee ID numbers, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMTV9N4zh8&t=533.0600000000001s)]
