# Sam Altman, Elon Musk feud over OpenAI bid
**CBS News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y)
*  All right, right now, a rivalry between big tech billionaires playing out as we speak. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=0.0s)]
*  We're talking about Elon Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=5.4s)]
*  Altman firing back after a Musk-led group submitted an unsolicited $97.4 billion bid [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=10.44s)]
*  to take over OpenAI. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=18.48s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=20.52s)]
*  Sam, should you have taken Elon's offer? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=21.52s)]
*  You refuse $1 billion for Elon Musk. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=24.88s)]
*  What do you want to say to Elon Musk? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=27.64s)]
*  Received what from him? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=28.64s)]
*  Almost $100 billion, right? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=30.28s)]
*  The company is not for sale. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=32.08s)]
*  Neither is the mission. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=33.08s)]
*  We're happy to buy Twitter if you can talk about that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=34.08s)]
*  Wow, okay. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=37.0s)]
*  Altman made that same message in a post to X saying he'll buy Twitter for just $9.74 [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=38.44s)]
*  billion. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=45.08s)]
*  CBS News correspondent, Money Watch correspondent Kelly O'Grady joins us live. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=46.08s)]
*  And Kelly, thanks for being here. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=50.72s)]
*  Altman is under mounting pressure right now to transform OpenAI from a nonprofit to a [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=52.6s)]
*  for-profit organization. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=58.8s)]
*  So does Musk's bid ramp up that pressure he's feeling? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=60.12s)]
*  To some extent, yes. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=66.24s)]
*  I mean, for one, even though this might have been a rather shocking number that he threw [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=67.24s)]
*  out there, we've seen this before with Twitter. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=73.08s)]
*  And we know how that story played out over a number of months. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=76.28s)]
*  The thing to remember here is that Musk and Sam Altman, they were co-founders of OpenAI [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=79.72s)]
*  and that was supposed to be an open source nonprofit company. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=84.84s)]
*  And now, as you mentioned, Sam Altman is spinning out this for-profit mission where there's [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  been a lot of controversy over that, even within his own company. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=95.52s)]
*  And so to some extent, this bid from Musk does put pressure because he is having to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=99.44s)]
*  go around to convince his current investors and sort of siphon this piece off that if [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=104.8s)]
*  some of them did find Musk's bid attractive, there would be some negotiation that would [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=110.8s)]
*  have to happen. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=115.92s)]
*  That being said, OpenAI has been very successful in its endeavors. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=116.92s)]
*  It does sound like their investors are happy with it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=120.84s)]
*  So how much pressure Musk's bid puts on the situation is a little bit hard to tell, but [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  certainly a lot of attention on the situation, Mugo. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=129.44s)]
*  A whole lot of attention. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=132.28s)]
*  Okay, Kelly, Elon Musk's name is also popping up on Capitol Hill right now. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  Lawmakers oppressing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over Elon Musk's Department [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=137.6s)]
*  of Government Efficiency gaining access to a payment system within the Treasury Department. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=142.92s)]
*  Let's take a listen to that first. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=148.4s)]
*  Is the system safe today? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=149.92s)]
*  I believe it is and I will tell you, we are very strongly committed to the integrity, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  efficacy, resilience and all those things of this system. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=156.84s)]
*  And you know, people do depend on this in a big way and we're committed to that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=160.88s)]
*  An unelected billionaire and his hackster's dangerous attempts to access Americans' private [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=164.4s)]
*  data and the Treasury Department's systems that control $6 trillion in annual payments [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=170.04s)]
*  to millions of American citizens, including Social Security, Medicare and tax refunds. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=176.24s)]
*  Quickly, yes or no. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=181.16s)]
*  Has Elon Musk or members of his team, to your knowledge, attempted to access the Fed's [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=182.4s)]
*  Okay, Kelly, we gotta know, what is your immediate reaction to these exchanges? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=191.08s)]
*  So look, there's always some drama when it comes to these hearings. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=205.28s)]
*  I think what's interesting to hear is someone who doesn't have a political affiliation, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=207.96s)]
*  you're not supposed to have a political affiliation at the head of the Federal Reserve. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=212.60000000000002s)]
*  There's been a lot of scrutiny on whether Musk does have access to these and you are [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  hearing from someone who has direct knowledge of it, that he's not worried about it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=220.76s)]
*  So that's what I'm taking away from that exchange. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=225.56s)]
*  All right, Kelly O'Grady, thank you so much for your time. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyzbSuK14Y&t=228.28s)]
