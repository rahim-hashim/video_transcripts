# Trump expected to issue executive order to eliminate Education Department
**CBS News:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg)
*  All right, we started in Washington this hour where CBS News has now learned President Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=0.0s)]
*  is expected to issue an executive order to shutter the Department of Education. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=5.84s)]
*  The department was created by Congress in 1979 and it would take an act of Congress [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=11.08s)]
*  to now fully dismantle it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=16.16s)]
*  For more on this story, I want to bring in CBS News correspondent Natalie Brand live [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=18.18s)]
*  at the White House for us. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=21.76s)]
*  Natalie, explain, could this executive order for the DOE lead to a showdown with Congress? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=23.28s)]
*  Well, absolutely, Chanel, because as you noted, this would require congressional approval [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=29.720000000000002s)]
*  to actually close the Department of Education. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=35.0s)]
*  But from what CBS News has confirmed about this executive order, we believe it would [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  aim to take steps to dissolve the Department of Education, noting to the extent appropriate [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=44.92s)]
*  and permitted by law. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  As we know, this was something that the newly confirmed Education Secretary Linda McMahon [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=55.31999999999999s)]
*  was grilled about during her confirmation hearing, in which she said that, you know, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=60.36s)]
*  she agrees with the president's goal, the administration's goal of returning more oversight [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  to the states. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=72.72s)]
*  Notably, she was asked if the Department of Education is downsized, would states and localities [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=73.92s)]
*  still receive the federal funding which they currently do receive? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=80.64s)]
*  And she responded, yes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  She also during that hearing acknowledged that this would take congressional approval. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=86.72s)]
*  So the big question that's outstanding is, you know, what steps could the administration [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=91.84s)]
*  legally take to continue to shrink the department? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=97.92s)]
*  We already know that there have been layoffs. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=101.44s)]
*  So what other directives could be issued? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=104.24s)]
*  In a new memo by Linda McMahon to staff, she alluded to an overhaul and again, increased [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=107.52s)]
*  state oversight. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=114.72s)]
*  Already, teachers groups and Democratic lawmakers, but notably teachers groups, are pushing back, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=115.91999999999999s)]
*  saying that they will fight this tooth and nail, saying that really the goal of the department [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=122.32s)]
*  is to level the playing field and they worry that any steps to dismantle it, you know, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=127.84s)]
*  would really hurt students in particular states where there are less state resources. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=134.88s)]
*  I want to read you a quote from the president of the American Federation of Teachers Union, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=140.8s)]
*  Randy Weingarten. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=146.16s)]
*  She says, trying to abolish it, which by the way only Congress can do, sends a message [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=149.28s)]
*  that the president, quote, doesn't care about opportunity for all kids. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=154.72s)]
*  She goes on to say, maybe he cares about it for his own kids or his friends' kids or donors' kids, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=159.44s)]
*  but not all kids. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=164.24s)]
*  So that's the message today from teachers unions, but certainly this order, when it is [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=165.68s)]
*  eventually signed, would face a lot of pushback. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=172.4s)]
*  Chanel. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=175.76s)]
*  And Natalie, we're also learning tens of thousands of veterans of fair jobs stand to be eliminated. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=176.16s)]
*  Explain why. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=182.8s)]
*  So in an internal memo obtained by CBS News, VA leaders say that they want to return the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  Veterans Affairs Agency to staffing levels from 2019. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=193.44s)]
*  This is part of efforts we know by the administration, by the Department of Government [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=198.8s)]
*  Efficiency to try to downsize the federal government telling agencies to submit plans [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  for downsizing. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  The department or the VA was significantly expanded during the Biden administration, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=210.96s)]
*  in part to try to provide more coverage for veterans through the PACT Act, which provides [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=216.08s)]
*  coverage for exposure to toxic burn pits, which you may remember. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=223.68s)]
*  So what we could be looking at is tens of thousands, up to 70,000 employees potentially [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=227.52s)]
*  cut, again, Democratic lawmakers, VA groups fighting back, particularly noting that a [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  number of these employees that have been fired are veterans themselves, Chanel. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=240.24s)]
*  All right, Natalie Brand live at the White House for us. Thank you. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-CTtgdBZVg&t=245.52s)]
