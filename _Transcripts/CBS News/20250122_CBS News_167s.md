# Enrique Tarrio arrives in Miami to cheers, boos
**CBS News:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s)
*  Enrique Tarrio, who led the far-right Proud Boys group during January 6th, is out of jail [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=0.0s)]
*  and has arrived back home in Miami. Tarrio is one of the roughly 1,500 January 6th defendants [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=4.64s)]
*  who President Trump pardoned on his first day in office. He was facing a 22-year prison sentence [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=10.0s)]
*  for his seditious conspiracy and other charges. Despite not physically being president at the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=14.72s)]
*  Capitol during the riot, prosecutors argued that Tarrio played a central role in orchestrating the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=20.0s)]
*  events from outside Washington, D.C. CBS News national correspondent Manuel Barajas is there. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=24.96s)]
*  Benny, I was watching. I know you were there in person watching. It looked like he got a hero's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  welcome. Yeah, in some ways he did, at least from family and friends who were here to greet him as [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=33.68s)]
*  he walked just a few minutes ago through this passenger walkway here at Miami International [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=40.72s)]
*  Airport. Of course, a throng of cameras and reporters as well. He didn't immediately stop [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=45.6s)]
*  to answer any questions, but later on did seem to answer some questions. Of course, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=50.24s)]
*  that 22-year sentence, the longest given to anybody associated with January 6th, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=54.96s)]
*  is now gone. So there were cheers from the family and friends here, but I can also tell you that [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=59.92s)]
*  there were people here at the airport who booed him because not everybody thinks that he should [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=65.6s)]
*  be deserving of such a homecoming here back to Miami. We do want to play some sound that we got [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=70.88s)]
*  with him. Our crews in Dallas when he boarded the flight there about what the pardons all mean and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=79.2s)]
*  whether this is an attempt to really rewrite what happened on January 6th. I don't think this changed [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=85.44s)]
*  the conversation. I think November 5th of last year changed the conversation. I think America woke [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=91.68s)]
*  up and I think America made the right decision. It wasn't just for this. It was for all of us. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  You guys, freedom of press, freedom of speech. I think it was a big win for America as well. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  And he also there mentioned that he was certain that when President Trump was elected and then [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=112.64s)]
*  sworn in that he would be pardoned and he also felt that the Justice Department did not treat [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=116.8s)]
*  many of those defendants fairly and that some of those cases should have been moved out of D.C. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=122.0s)]
*  The one question I had for him, which again he walked by too quickly to answer, is what does he [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=128.72s)]
*  think? What message does pardon send to the law enforcement officers who were injured that day? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=134.08s)]
*  We still don't have an answer to what he believes about that. Remind us his role in January 6th and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=140.16s)]
*  do we know what his role in the with the Proud Boys will be in the future? You know that's really up [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=144.48s)]
*  to debate and in the interviews that he's done since being released he has said you know many [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=149.92s)]
*  people in the media have referred to me as the ex-leader of the Proud Boys and he says soon you [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=154.16s)]
*  won't be saying ex but he hasn't elaborated so really we don't know. Okay my mobile work has. Thank you. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD9bElJpd9s&t=160.0s)]
