# A look at the destruction from the Los Angeles fires
**CBS News:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A)
*  The air above Los Angeles County is just filled with smoke still as crews battle multiple deadly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=0.0s)]
*  wildfires including some that have been burning for three days straight. At least 10 people have [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=5.84s)]
*  been killed and more than 10,000 structures destroyed. As of Friday evening more than [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=10.32s)]
*  300,000 people are under an evacuation order or warning. Now the two massive fires, the Palisades [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  fire near Malibu and the Eaton fire near Pasadena, they're still burning. Crews have started to make [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=21.92s)]
*  some progress containing the spread of those destructive flames. Fire officials are also [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=27.52s)]
*  responding to three other dangerous fires there including the Kenneth fire that sparked Thursday [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=32.56s)]
*  and exploded to around 1,000 acres. Meantime city officials are coming under intense increasing [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=37.44s)]
*  public scrutiny over the response to these fires and that includes an evacuation alert that was [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=44.0s)]
*  accidentally sent out to all Los Angeles County residents on Thursday when it was only meant for [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=49.2s)]
*  people with homes near the Kenneth fire. CBS News' Jonathan Vigliotti asked Mayor Karen Bass [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=54.96s)]
*  what she can do now to earn back the public's trust. I want the residents of Los Angeles [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=61.04s)]
*  region to have faith in what we are doing 24 hours a day. That is our number one job to protect [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=68.64s)]
*  people's homes, to protect people's businesses and to prepare to rebuild Los Angeles in a much [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=77.68s)]
*  better way. We're going to stand united, we're going to stand together and we are not going to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  allow politics to interfere and we're not going to allow people to divide us for political gain. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Tom Hanson continues his on the ground coverage as you see on your screens. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=98.16000000000001s)]
*  He joins us from Altadena now. Tom, I know that you've been bearing the conditions speaking to [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=103.68s)]
*  people who've been evacuated and lost their homes. Bring us up to speed on some of the stories you've [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=109.84s)]
*  been hearing today. Yeah, well, Errol, I can first and foremost say that after being around these [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  areas for two days, seeing block after block after block of all of the destruction, it never [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  ceases to leave me stunned when I'm going around these areas. You know, we've spoken to people who [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=126.56s)]
*  are growing frustrated, they are scared, you know, they see such a long road ahead of them [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=131.68s)]
*  as they look to what's next. They're not even really focusing on recovering, they're still [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=138.56s)]
*  focusing on the scope of the problem, just how much damage has been caused to their homes and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=143.44s)]
*  also what, if anything, they have left. And to give you an example of this, we're standing in [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=150.4s)]
*  front of what appears to be an apartment complex based on these two fireplaces that you can see. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=155.44s)]
*  The only thing left standing are these brick columns, everything else, unrecognizable, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=161.04s)]
*  indistinguishable, just a pile of debris, glass, nails, soot, you name it. In fact, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  it's incredibly disorienting to be around this area. The only thing we can see as a point of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=173.28s)]
*  reference are the mountains over there, which on the other side, there still burns the eaten fire. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  And so you can see a plume of smoke even happening as we speak. There are still hot spots. Now, one [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=185.44s)]
*  of the things that's so fickle about these flames, if you want to take a look over here, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=190.96s)]
*  you can see a row of buildings, one of which has highly flammable wooden shingles, would easily [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=195.52s)]
*  combust if an ember touched it, relatively untouched. Now the question shifts to for the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=202.24s)]
*  people who are lucky enough to not have damage to their buildings. The question is what are they [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=208.24s)]
*  going to return home to? And what we do know is that local authorities are now saying that they [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=213.28s)]
*  are letting residents in this area back in for a one-time shot to retrieve any precious belongings, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=218.0s)]
*  any important documentation that they may have left behind. But I can tell you from what I've [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=225.28s)]
*  seen on the ground, there are many, many more scenes that are exactly like this than the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=232.24s)]
*  alternative, which is standing buildings. And so it's just a really tragic and shocking scene on [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=239.2s)]
*  the ground here, Errol. And I think capping all of that, Tom, is the reality that the fires are [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=244.48s)]
*  not yet contained. What is the latest on their continued spread? Oh my gosh, the fires just keep [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=249.67999999999998s)]
*  on popping up here and there, hot spots popping up here and there, and there is little to no [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  containment in any of these areas. We are not looking at a 50% containment for any of these [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=264.4s)]
*  fires. We're looking at low double digits or even single digits upon my last look at the maps here. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=271.36s)]
*  Now what I can tell you is that the weather has been to blame for a lot of that. We've been [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=278.24s)]
*  facing those severe, strong, dangerous gusts of wind from the Santa Annas, which have prevented [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=283.76s)]
*  firefighters from tackling these flames. What we do know is that we're going to get a little bit of [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  reprieve. Firefighters are no doubt going to be seizing all that opportunity to try to get ahead [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=296.64s)]
*  of these flames over the coming days, Errol. Yeah, and those dry conditions just fuel these blazes. Tom [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=300.8s)]
*  Hanson, we really appreciate your coverage. You and the crew stay safe. Now as of Friday evening, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=306.48s)]
*  CAL FIRE reports that Eaton Fire burning near Pasadena, California is at about 3% contained. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=312.08s)]
*  CBS News national correspondent Chris Van Cleave is nearby in Altadena, where the devastation there [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=318.24s)]
*  is also catastrophic. Chris? Fire crews are taking advantage of a break in the winds here [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=324.32s)]
*  in the Pasadena area to mount an aerial attack on the Eaton Fire as it burns in the mountains [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=330.4s)]
*  behind Altadena and Pasadena. Also new today, we saw a much tighter security presence. National [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  Guard in armored vehicles manning a perimeter around the evacuation area as the Sheriff's [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  Department ramps up its patrols inside. They are looking for looters after nearly two dozen arrests [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=350.96s)]
*  in evacuation zones where looters had come in and broken into homes that had survived the fire. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=357.52s)]
*  Now you can hear the helicopters as they are circling this area. Those are water drops. That [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=364.79999999999995s)]
*  is a crucial part of the effort here to try to make progress in containing the Eaton Fire. They [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=368.79999999999995s)]
*  have managed to beat the fire back from a key communications hub, a transmission tower at the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=373.91999999999996s)]
*  top of Mount Wilson, the highest point in Los Angeles. That's good news, but of course there [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=380.4s)]
*  remains concern as long as that fire is burning. If the winds come back, so does the danger. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=384.8s)]
*  Back to you. Chris Van Cleave, thank you for that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQI_pbK44A&t=390.48s)]
