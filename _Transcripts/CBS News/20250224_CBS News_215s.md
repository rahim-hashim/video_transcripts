# How Germany's far-right party gained ground during elections
**CBS News:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM)
*  Right now we're following a political shift in Germany this morning where provisional [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=0.0s)]
*  results in the country's election over the weekend show the mainstream conservatives [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=4.4s)]
*  led by Friedrich Merz have the largest number of seats in the new parliament. However, an anti-immigration [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=8.56s)]
*  party endorsed by Elon Musk won an historic 20 percent of the vote, which is the strongest showing [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  for the far right in Germany since World War II. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=20.8s)]
*  Williams is in Berlin as you see on your screens and joins us now to discuss this. Holly, how close [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=26.16s)]
*  will the election results to expectations? Good morning, Errol. Well, the alternative for Germany [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=31.12s)]
*  or AFD has had its best ever result in a national election. They're on course to win about 20 percent [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=39.44s)]
*  of the vote and finish in second place. That's since the far right party was founded just 12 [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=45.28s)]
*  years ago. Now, during the campaign, the party's leader, Alis Vidal, pledged to carry out the mass [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=50.08s)]
*  deportation of immigrants, and that is popular with some voters in Germany who believe that [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=56.0s)]
*  their country has taken in too many too quickly. Their frustration has been further fueled by a [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=60.88s)]
*  series of violent attacks carried out by asylum seekers here. And Germany's stagnant economy, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=66.24s)]
*  I think, also probably helped the AFD at the polls. But many Germans are outraged by the rise of the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=71.52s)]
*  far right here. Their country has famously spent decades coming to terms with its Nazi history. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=78.8s)]
*  One of the AFD's regional leaders used a Nazi slogan at campaign events. German intelligence [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=85.04s)]
*  has placed the party under surveillance for suspected extremism. And Germany's mainstream [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=91.68s)]
*  parties have formed a pact vowing not to form a governing coalition with the AFD. But despite [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=96.64s)]
*  that, this month in Germany, Vice President JD Vance met with the AFD's leader, reportedly in [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  a hotel basement. In a speech, Vance also urged Europe to stop isolating far right parties. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=109.12s)]
*  And Elon Musk has gone even further, publicly endorsing the AFD and making a virtual appearance [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=116.48s)]
*  at one of their campaign events and saying, quote, I think you're really the best hope for Germany. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=122.56s)]
*  Now, this is part of a surge in popularity for far right parties in some countries here in Europe, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=128.08s)]
*  and they've had support from some in the US. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=133.68s)]
*  Holly, no party won an outright majority. So what happens now? What will the new [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=137.76000000000002s)]
*  parliament and new policy out of Germany look like? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  So, Errol, it's now up to Germany's mainstream parties to try and form a governing coalition. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=148.56s)]
*  The party with the highest number of votes, the Christian Democratic Union, or CDU, is sent [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  to right at one about 30% of the vote. Its leader, Friedrich Mertz, looks set to become Germany's new [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=158.24s)]
*  chancellor or leader. It seems likely that they will form or try to form a coalition with the SPD, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=163.36s)]
*  that is the Social Democratic Party. They are sent to left. They won about 16% of the vote. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=168.72000000000003s)]
*  Those two parties have governed together previously. If they cannot govern successfully, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=173.52s)]
*  that could further fuel the popularity of the AFD, because the AFD appears to have tapped into a kind [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=178.88000000000002s)]
*  of groundswell of grievances here in Germany, connected to the stagnant economy, to the sense [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=184.8s)]
*  that leaders are not listening, and most particularly on the topic of immigration. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=190.64s)]
*  It's worth pointing out, I think, that many German voters say that they want more controls, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  more curbs on immigration, but at the same time they are appalled by some of the things that the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=200.16s)]
*  AFD has said during the campaign. Errol? And we'll have a deeper dive on Germany's economy later [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=206.32s)]
*  this hour. Holly Williams in Berlin. Thank you very much, Holly. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiVvbAzMKM&t=211.67999999999998s)]
