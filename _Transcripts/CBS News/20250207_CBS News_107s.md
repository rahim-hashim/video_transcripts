# Trump issues sanctions against International Criminal Court
**CBS News:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A)
*  President Trump has imposed sanctions on the International Criminal Court, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=0.0s)]
*  accusing the body of quote, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=4.24s)]
*  illegitimate and baseless actions against the U.S. and against Israel. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=5.84s)]
*  The move came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=10.88s)]
*  met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill yesterday. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=13.56s)]
*  Netanyahu and his former defense minister, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=16.56s)]
*  they're both the subject of ICC arrest warrants [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=18.92s)]
*  for alleged war crimes committed in Gaza. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=22.16s)]
*  Israel denies those allegations. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=24.52s)]
*  Joe Inwood with our partners at BBC News brings us more now [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=26.84s)]
*  from Jerusalem. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  So it will come as no surprise that the decision to put sanctions [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  on the ICC was warmly welcomed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=35.12s)]
*  He said that the courts never had any legitimacy, as did his foreign minister. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=40.36s)]
*  They have previously accused the ICC of creating a moral equivalence [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas and said that their decisions are anti-Semitic, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  something, of course, the court denies. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=53.599999999999994s)]
*  In terms of those opposed to the sanctions, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=56.16s)]
*  well, Iran have said that it would be strongly critical of the decision [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=58.6s)]
*  to try and sanction the ICC, and the ICC itself has said [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=62.44s)]
*  that it will continue its work. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=65.72s)]
*  In terms of the practical implications, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=68.56s)]
*  I don't think it changes the calculation for Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=70.08s)]
*  as to where he can travel. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=73.2s)]
*  Despite what the U.S. has done, countries who are signatories [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=74.64s)]
*  to the ICC treaties would still be under an obligation to arrest him, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=77.4s)]
*  although the diplomatic consequences of doing so would be higher now. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=81.28s)]
*  It will potentially make the work of the ICC more difficult, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=85.4s)]
*  restricting their ability to travel and making moving resources around more difficult. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=88.68s)]
*  But what this really does do is it shows us once more [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  that Donald Trump is taking the side of Israel in its many [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  and increasing disputes with international bodies, including the ICC. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=99.68s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=104.36s)]
*  All right, Joe Inwood, thank you for that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1W4IhpGN0A&t=105.16s)]
