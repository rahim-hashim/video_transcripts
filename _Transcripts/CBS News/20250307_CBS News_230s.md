# Ex-FEMA chief financial officer says she's gotten threats after being fired
**CBS News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E)
*  The chief financial officer at FEMA was fired after Elon Musk alleged that she illegally [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=0.0s)]
*  sent funds to New York City to book luxury hotels for migrants. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  But in an interview with CBS Evening News co-anchor Maurice Dubois, Mary Komen says [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=11.6s)]
*  she was directed by a member of DOJ to make the payments. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=16.3s)]
*  I was directed by the Trump administration and the DOJ team to make that payment. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=21.2s)]
*  What if you said, okay, I'm not going to make that payment? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=27.62s)]
*  How would that have worked out? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=33.22s)]
*  The discussions and the dialogue that I had with the leadership at DHS as well as the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=35.58s)]
*  DOJ team, they were not looking for our feedback and input. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=40.5s)]
*  They were directing our action and letting us know what we can and cannot do. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=45.74s)]
*  So you're saying this is false. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=52.1s)]
*  Do you think the administration knows this is false? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=54.74s)]
*  That's really a question for the administration. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=59.06s)]
*  Do you think they had some other reason for firing you? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=65.7s)]
*  I think I was fired for political motivations. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=69.78s)]
*  What those are are really questions both for Secretary Noem and President Trump and Elon [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=73.72s)]
*  Musk. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=79.42s)]
*  I think it's unfortunate that myself and three other individuals were terminated by simply [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=80.5s)]
*  doing what we were told to do. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=87.66s)]
*  There was a tweet from the world's richest man, Elon Musk, saying what you did was a [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=90.42s)]
*  criminal action. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=94.74000000000001s)]
*  How'd you take that? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=96.34s)]
*  Again, it's hurtful. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=100.82000000000001s)]
*  But I know it's not true. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=109.3s)]
*  I've done nothing but serve with integrity and honor. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=112.5s)]
*  And it's unfortunate that words like that can be thrown around without recourse. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=118.89999999999999s)]
*  My name has been slandered. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=125.84s)]
*  I've been personally attacked. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=127.86s)]
*  My family has been harassed. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=129.96s)]
*  And my story is not unique. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=133.57999999999998s)]
*  It is the story of many public servants across the nation today. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=136.42s)]
*  And at some point, it has to stop. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=141.57999999999998s)]
*  And Maurice Dubois joins us now. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=145.22s)]
*  Maurice, what a powerful interview. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=147.22s)]
*  She said her family has been harassed. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=149.17999999999998s)]
*  Is she receiving threats that lead her to feel that she's in danger? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=151.39999999999998s)]
*  She certainly is and does feel in danger, Nancy. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=156.14s)]
*  You saw that passion, that emotion there. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=159.83999999999997s)]
*  Here's somebody who joined DHS in the years after 9-11. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=161.89999999999998s)]
*  She's very passionate about serving her country. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=166.01999999999998s)]
*  And ultimately, she becomes the CFO of FEMA. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=167.89999999999998s)]
*  And she thought she was doing the right thing, giving out money to people from disasters, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=172.39999999999998s)]
*  people who needed it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=176.14s)]
*  And now she finds herself the target of threats online. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=177.7s)]
*  She feels she has to change her movements. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=181.62s)]
*  And as you said there, she feels her family is threatened. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=183.45999999999998s)]
*  She's told the local police department to keep an eye on her and her family. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=186.78s)]
*  She's that terrified. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=190.5s)]
*  And so what does she want to see happen now? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=192.85999999999999s)]
*  Is she going to try to take Elon Musk to court over this? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=196.14s)]
*  She is suing DHS. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=200.18s)]
*  I have the suit here. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=201.66s)]
*  It's 11 pages, lawsuit. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=202.66s)]
*  She is alleging that she was illegally fired. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=204.57999999999998s)]
*  She is suing for damages, alleging defamation. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=208.22s)]
*  She even says she wants her job back. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=211.66s)]
*  I asked her how much money she wants. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=213.34s)]
*  She said she wouldn't get into that, obviously, at this point. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=215.22s)]
*  But she wants her name cleared and she wants to be made whole again. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=218.29999999999998s)]
*  One of many lawsuits resulting from these mass firings. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=222.66s)]
*  Maurice Dubois, thanks so much for bringing that story to us. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=226.58s)]
*  Thank you, Nance. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62sDcSCzB2E&t=229.38s)]
