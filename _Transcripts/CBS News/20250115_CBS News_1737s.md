# President Biden's farewell address to the nation | Special Report
**CBS News:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8)
*  This is a CBS News special report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Nora O'Donnell. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=13.36s)]
*  President Biden is about to deliver a farewell address to the nation as his five decades [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=14.92s)]
*  of public service nears an end. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  This address is actually a tradition that dates back to George Washington. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  The 46th president came into office during the height of the COVID pandemic, saying he [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=26.96s)]
*  would be a bridge to the next generation. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=31.44s)]
*  But his accomplishments have been overshadowed, and instead he becomes a bridge from one Trump [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=34.36s)]
*  administration to another. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=38.92s)]
*  We expect Mr. Biden to tout his accomplishments, including today's ceasefire deal between [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=41.04s)]
*  Israel and Hamas, and a historic investment in infrastructure. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=45.64s)]
*  Biden also spearheaded support for the Ukrainians in their war against Russia. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  But his approval rating hovers at just under 40 percent. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=55.42s)]
*  While Biden pulled America out of the war in Afghanistan, it was a violent and chaotic [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=58.7s)]
*  withdrawal. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=64.38s)]
*  The situation at the southern border also dominated the 2024 election. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=65.38s)]
*  Plus inflation has many Americans saying it's hard to make ends meet. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=70.1s)]
*  As you remember, President Biden fought for reelection until last summer, dropping out [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=74.1s)]
*  after a disastrous debate performance. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=78.1s)]
*  His critics say it was too little, too late. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=80.7s)]
*  We did get a farewell letter released by the White House this morning, and in that letter [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=83.62s)]
*  Mr. Biden said, I've given my heart and soul to the nation. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=87.14s)]
*  Here now, the president. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=90.34s)]
*  My fellow Americans, I'm speaking to you tonight from the Oval Office. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=91.34s)]
*  Before I begin, let me speak to important news from earlier today. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=96.94000000000001s)]
*  After eight months of nonstop negotiation by administration, by my administration, a [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=101.34s)]
*  ceasefire and a hostage deal has been reached by Israel and Hamas. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=107.7s)]
*  The elements of which I laid out in great detail in May of this year. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=112.5s)]
*  This plan was developed and negotiated by my team, and it will be largely implemented [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=117.94s)]
*  by the incoming administration. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=123.82s)]
*  That's why I told my team to keep the incoming administration fully informed, because that's [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=126.34s)]
*  how it should be, working together as Americans. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=131.3s)]
*  This will be my final address to you from the American people from the Oval Office, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=135.78s)]
*  from this desk as president. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=139.86s)]
*  And I've been thinking a lot about who we are, and maybe more importantly, who we should [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=141.94s)]
*  be. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=146.58s)]
*  Long ago in New York Harbor, an iron worker installed beam after beam, day after day. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=147.58s)]
*  He was joined by steelworkers, stonemasons, engineers. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=156.38000000000002s)]
*  They built not just a single structure, but a beacon of freedom. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=160.94s)]
*  The very idea of America was so big, we felt the entire world needed to see. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=166.26s)]
*  The Statue of Liberty, a gift from France after our Civil War. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=172.17999999999998s)]
*  Like the very idea of America, it was built not by one person, but by many people, from [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=177.57999999999998s)]
*  every background and from around the world. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=182.34s)]
*  Like America, the Statue of Liberty is not standing still. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=186.29999999999998s)]
*  Her foot literally steps forward atop a broken chain of human bondage. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=191.54s)]
*  She's on the march, and she literally moves. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=197.1s)]
*  She was built to sway back and forth to withstand the fury of stormy weather. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=201.5s)]
*  To stand the test of time because storms are always coming. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=206.54s)]
*  She sways a few inches, but she never falls into the current below. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=210.57999999999998s)]
*  An engineering marvel. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=214.94s)]
*  The Statue of Liberty is also an enduring symbol of the soul of our nation. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=217.08s)]
*  A soul shaped by forces that bring us together and by forces that pull us apart. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  And yet through good times and tough times, we've astute at all. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=227.8s)]
*  A nation of pioneers and explorers, of dreamers and doers, of ancestors native to this land, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=232.68s)]
*  of ancestors that came by force. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=240.76000000000002s)]
*  The nation of immigrants came to build a better life. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=243.4s)]
*  A nation holding the torch of the most powerful idea ever in the history of the world. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  That all of us, all of us are created equal. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=254.36s)]
*  That all of us deserve to be treated with dignity, justice, and fairness. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=257.32s)]
*  That democracy must defend and be defined and be imposed, moved in every way possible. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=263.48s)]
*  Our rights, our freedoms, our dreams. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=274.72s)]
*  But we know the idea of America, our institution, our people, our values that uphold it are [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=277.12s)]
*  constantly being tested. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=284.04s)]
*  Ongoing debates about power and the exercise of power. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=286.72s)]
*  But whether we lead by the example of our power or the power of our example, whether [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=291.0s)]
*  we show the courage to stand up to the abuse of power or we yield to it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=297.2s)]
*  After 50 years at the center of all of this, I know that believing in the idea of America [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=302.94s)]
*  means respecting the institution as a governed, a free society. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=309.76s)]
*  The presidency, the Congress, the courts, a free and independent press. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=315.0s)]
*  Institutions that are rooted, they just might not reflect the timeless words, but they echo [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=322.64000000000004s)]
*  the words of the Declaration of Independence. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=331.16s)]
*  We hold these truths to be self-evident. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=334.12s)]
*  Rooted in the timeless words of the Constitution, we the people. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=337.48s)]
*  Our system of separation of powers checks and balances. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=342.64s)]
*  It may not be perfect, but it's maintained our democracy for nearly 250 years, longer [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=346.08s)]
*  than any other nation in history that's ever tried such a bold experiment. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=353.4s)]
*  In the past four years, our democracy has held strong. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=359.12s)]
*  And every day I've kept my commitment to be president for all Americans. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=363.71999999999997s)]
*  Through one of the toughest periods in our nation's history. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=367.4s)]
*  I've had a great partner and Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=371.6s)]
*  It's been the honor of my life to see the resilience of essential workers getting this [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=374.48s)]
*  through once in a century pandemic. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=381.16s)]
*  The heroism of service members and first responders keeping us safe. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=383.72s)]
*  The determination of advocates standing up for our rights and our freedoms. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=388.72s)]
*  Instead of losing their jobs to an economic crisis that we inherited, millions of Americans [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=394.16s)]
*  now have the dignity of work. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=400.64000000000004s)]
*  Millions of entrepreneurs and companies creating new businesses and industries. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=402.8s)]
*  Hiring American workers, using American products. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=407.8s)]
*  Together we've launched a new era of American possibilities. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=412.12s)]
*  One of the greatest modernizations of infrastructure in our entire history. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  From new roads, bridges, clean water, affordable high speed internet for every American. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=421.36s)]
*  We invented the semiconductor, smaller than the tip of my little finger. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=428.76s)]
*  And now it's bringing those chip factories and those jobs back to America where they [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=433.44s)]
*  belong. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=437.15999999999997s)]
*  Creating thousands of jobs. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=439.0s)]
*  Finally, giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for millions [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=441.0s)]
*  of seniors. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=447.28s)]
*  And finally, doing something to protect our children and our families by passing the most [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=448.88s)]
*  significant gun safety law in 30 years. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=455.32s)]
*  And bringing violent crime to a 50 year low. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=458.76s)]
*  Meeting our sacred obligation to over one million veterans so far who are exposed to [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=462.28s)]
*  toxic materials. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=467.32s)]
*  And to their families providing medical care and education benefits and more for their [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=469.59999999999997s)]
*  families. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=474.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, it will take time to feel the full impact of all we've done together. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=475.71999999999997s)]
*  But the seeds are planted and they'll grow and they'll bloom for decades to come. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=483.52s)]
*  At home we've created nearly 17 million new jobs more than any other single administration, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=489.15999999999997s)]
*  single term. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=495.08s)]
*  More people have health care than ever before. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=497.12s)]
*  And overseas we've strengthened NATO. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  Ukraine is still free. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=502.88s)]
*  And we've pulled ahead of our competition with China. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=505.28s)]
*  And so much more. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=507.56s)]
*  I'm so proud of how much we've accomplished together for the American people. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=510.4s)]
*  And I wish the incoming administration success because I want America to succeed. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=514.48s)]
*  That's why I've held my duty to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition of power. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=521.48s)]
*  To ensure we lead by the power of our example. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=527.4s)]
*  I have no doubt that America is in a position to continue to succeed. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=531.4399999999999s)]
*  That's why my farewell address tonight. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=535.92s)]
*  I want to warn the country of some things that give me great concern. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=538.48s)]
*  This is a dangerous concentration and that's a dangerous concentration of power in the [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=543.84s)]
*  hands of a very few ultra wealthy people. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=547.88s)]
*  The dangerous consequences if their abuse of power is left unchecked. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=551.12s)]
*  Today an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=557.04s)]
*  literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms and a fair [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=563.1999999999999s)]
*  shot for everyone to get ahead. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=569.24s)]
*  We see the consequences all across America and we've seen it before. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=573.04s)]
*  More than a century ago the American people stood up to the robber barons back then and [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=578.1999999999999s)]
*  busted the trusts. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=585.0s)]

*  This was a warning, as you said, and that really is extraordinary. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1189.28s)]
*  It wasn't the fond farewell perhaps that we were prepared for. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1192.9199999999998s)]
*  With the president really just rattling off, as you said, a number of warnings of the guard [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1196.8799999999999s)]
*  rails of democracy that he says are in peril. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1201.5s)]
*  One of them are very industry. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1203.8799999999999s)]
*  He said the free press is crumbling, pointing to social media, making that connection back [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1205.28s)]
*  to technology and lack of fact checking. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1209.6399999999999s)]
*  He talked about the need to hold accountable social platforms. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1212.2s)]
*  All of this seemingly in that space framed around some of the political forces of the [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1215.8799999999999s)]
*  moment who are aligned with Donald Trump, although his successor was not named there. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1220.92s)]
*  Some of the CEOs who have come out and said that they're going to attend the inauguration. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1226.52s)]
*  You have to imagine he wrote this with them in mind. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1229.98s)]
*  But also warning on the national security front saying that this next generation is [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1232.58s)]
*  going to be really shaped by artificial intelligence. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1237.64s)]
*  A.I. said it is the most consequential technology and really called for safeguards there. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1240.72s)]
*  Having opened with the idea that we, he said, moved forward against China in that competition [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1247.88s)]
*  over this technology space. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1254.16s)]
*  Really warning that it's not just a foe from without that can weaponize technology, but [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1256.42s)]
*  from within the threats to the forces that are underpinning our democracy. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1261.68s)]
*  Fact checking and the basics. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1268.04s)]
*  Robert Costa is with us. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1269.44s)]
*  Well, you've covered the president interviewed him several months ago. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1270.96s)]
*  What did you make of his final speech? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1274.4s)]
*  At one level, it was deeply personal. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1276.76s)]
*  Norah, you did see the photos of the family sitting behind President Biden, including [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1278.52s)]
*  his late son, Bo Biden. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1282.4s)]
*  Earlier today, I was at the Capitol meeting with President Biden's close friends like [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1284.28s)]
*  And they expected him to advocate for his record. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1288.72s)]
*  But what was most striking was what you mentioned. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1291.76s)]
*  The echo of Dwight D. Eisenhower. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1293.76s)]
*  January 17th, 1961, President Eisenhower, in his own farewell address, warned the nation [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1296.08s)]
*  of a so-called military industrial complex. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1302.3600000000001s)]
*  Now President Biden, as he departs the presidency, is warning of a, quote, tech industrial complex. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1305.68s)]
*  And this comes as Elon Musk, the billionaire, and others like Jeff Bezos are prepared to [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1311.4s)]
*  sit on that dais at the inaugural for President-elect Donald Trump on January 20th. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1315.84s)]
*  And you see President Biden, who began his career as Scranton Joe, as someone who was [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1320.8799999999999s)]
*  an advocate for working people, ending his presidency as someone underscoring his own [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1325.36s)]
*  progressive values, really sending a signal to the left in this country that he stood [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1330.28s)]
*  with them on their core economic issues. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1335.76s)]
*  I want to bring in Weijia Jiang. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1338.24s)]
*  She is our senior White House correspondent outside the White House. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1340.0s)]
*  Weijia, you have covered this president so closely. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1344.08s)]
*  What do you make of how he made up this address? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1347.04s)]
*  Not only the accomplishments that he feels he did not get credit for, but also this warning [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1349.3999999999999s)]
*  in a very populous tone. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1354.6799999999998s)]
*  Well, Nora, frankly, I expected much more about his accomplishments and his personal [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1357.0s)]
*  story in this farewell address because White House sources had talked about, leading up [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1363.8799999999999s)]
*  to this moment, how this was not just an exit from the White House, but this was an [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1369.64s)]
*  exit from 50 years of his public service. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1373.72s)]
*  And he really wanted this to be personal and positive and nonpartisan. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1377.3600000000001s)]
*  But certainly his message was dark in many ways as he issued those warnings. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1383.4s)]
*  And even though he did not mention any of his political opponents by name, including [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1388.0s)]
*  Trump, even though he did not talk about those tech tycoons who are now weaved into the Trump [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1393.0s)]
*  administration, certainly almost every warning he had was a veiled strike at them, whether [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1398.44s)]
*  it was a miss and disinformation, talking about the lack of fact checking on social [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1405.16s)]
*  media platforms after Mark Zuckerberg announced their new policy, whether it was about the [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1410.3600000000001s)]
*  concentration of wealth, and you're talking about some of the richest men in the world [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1415.68s)]
*  now in his orbit, whether he's talking about AI safeguards. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1420.72s)]
*  So I thought it was really interesting that he chose to spend so much time on those things, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1425.12s)]
*  Nora, instead of his legacy. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1430.48s)]
*  But he will be making several more speeches this week, so he'll have more chances to do that. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1432.48s)]
*  Nora. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1437.44s)]
*  Nancy, thank you. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1438.48s)]
*  Want to bring in our chief White House correspondent, Nancy Cordes. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1439.6s)]
*  She is with President-elect Trump in West Palm Beach, Florida. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1442.72s)]
*  And Nancy, that warning from President Biden about what this new Trump White House may [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1446.8799999999999s)]
*  look like and in his words, to stand guard, as Margaret said, or stand up to abuse of [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1453.76s)]
*  power is what he was concerned about tonight. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1459.76s)]
*  Right, Nora. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1464.16s)]
*  In fact, he started this speech much in the same way he started his inaugural address [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1464.72s)]
*  nearly four years ago, talking about the need to defend democracy. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1469.84s)]
*  And the subtext there is not going to be lost on Donald Trump or his supporters here in West [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1474.72s)]
*  Palm Beach, because normally when Joe Biden talks about defending democracy, he is talking [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1480.72s)]
*  about Donald Trump, who he has described several times as a threat to democracy. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1486.08s)]
*  And what was fascinating was that even as Biden was speaking, Donald Trump was posting, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1492.24s)]
*  not on X, owned by Elon Musk, but on his site, Truth Social, that as he fills out the ranks [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1497.92s)]
*  of his administration, he doesn't want to hire anyone who has worked for someone he views as [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1504.64s)]
*  disloyal or as an enemy. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1511.3600000000001s)]
*  And he actually helpfully put out a list of people who fit that category. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1513.0400000000002s)]
*  He said, don't send me any names of anyone who has worked for Mike Pence, his former [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1518.3200000000002s)]
*  vice president, or Paul Ryan or Liz Cheney or her father, the former vice president, Dick Cheney. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1524.16s)]
*  I'm not hiring them. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1530.96s)]
*  The message he's clearly sending, I only want to hire people who are true believers. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1532.48s)]
*  Nancy Cordes in West Palm Beach, where that transition is underway. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1538.64s)]
*  Nancy, thank you. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1542.4s)]
*  Want to bring in our senior White House and political correspondent, Ed O'Keefe. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1543.76s)]
*  And, Ed, you heard President Biden mention the seeds are planted. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1548.88s)]
*  He's talking about the idea. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1553.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, you may not be feeling the benefit of all of my big policy ideas. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1554.72s)]
*  I know inflation still exists, but the seeds are there, and you will eventually feel them. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1559.28s)]
*  That's right. As you mentioned, 39% approval rating, not the greatest number to go out with. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1563.36s)]
*  But what he's hoping for, what he's signaling, is that history is going to be kinder to him. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1567.36s)]
*  In recent interviews, he's lamented the fact that when various COVID stimulus checks went out in the [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1572.3999999999999s)]
*  early years of his presidency, he didn't sign them and put his name on them to reinforce that [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1577.68s)]
*  it was him who was helping Americans, believing now in hindsight that that would have helped [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1582.16s)]
*  in the short term at least shore up the belief among Americans that he was doing what he could [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1586.4s)]
*  to help. And so saying the seeds are planted and they'll grow and bloom for generations to come. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1590.4s)]
*  He's speaking to his infrastructure plan, the COVID relief that was established, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1594.96s)]
*  the fact that his administration at least worked to support and protect Ukraine [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1599.52s)]
*  in its ongoing struggle with Russia. And it's a statement that other unpopular presidents have [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1603.6000000000001s)]
*  made as well. George W. Bush is the one that comes to mind most immediately, who said, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1608.8000000000002s)]
*  I'm more worried about what history will say about me. And even a few years removed since, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1612.16s)]
*  given the whims of the Republican Party and the way the world has gone, history is already [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1616.08s)]
*  treating him kinder than it was in the beginning. To the point about oligarchy, Nora, also important [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1620.56s)]
*  to remember, he's not the first American president to warn of this. John Adams wrote about the few, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1625.04s)]
*  the well-born and the rich, and concerns that this country was going to put too much emphasis on them. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1630.3999999999999s)]
*  This is a problem that's come up before and has been addressed, and he's signaling to his party [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1635.36s)]
*  tonight. Focus on that, that populist message, and maybe that's the way to win back the White House. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1639.04s)]
*  Ed O'Keefe, thank you. I also want to focus on the big news of the day carried out with the Biden [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1644.32s)]
*  administration. They've been working on this for months at the president's directive, this new [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1652.0s)]
*  ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and this hostage deal. Margaret, you've been at the forefront of [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1656.56s)]
*  this reporting. How will these three phases of this deal work? Well, this is a capstone for Joe [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1662.24s)]
*  Biden, foreign policy legacy so key to him, and it is Donald Trump who will have to execute it. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1667.6799999999998s)]
*  Two of the three Americans still in captivity would come out in phase one. The other American, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1673.44s)]
*  Idan Alexander, would come out if Donald Trump can see this all the way through to the end. But [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1678.64s)]
*  it's 33 hostages, 42 days. If they get to phase two, which would be negotiated over the next six [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1682.8s)]
*  weeks by the Trump administration as well as regional partners, Qatar, Egypt and Israel, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1688.8s)]
*  they'd be able to get to potentially a full withdrawal in that second phase if they can get [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1694.4s)]
*  there. Ultimately, by phase three, they would be able to bring back and reclaim the remains of some [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1699.68s)]
*  of the Americans who died in captivity. The president's incoming national security advisor [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1704.4s)]
*  suggested that hostages could be being hugged by their families as Donald Trump is sworn into [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1708.64s)]
*  office. Is that a possibility? Perhaps even the day prior. By Sunday, we expect to see the first [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1712.5600000000002s)]
*  female captives released. Thank you, Margaret Brennan, Robert Costa. To all of our correspondents, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1718.16s)]
*  our coverage will continue on CBS News 24 seven, your local news and some of you on CBS Evening [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1722.72s)]
*  News. I'm Nora O'Donnell. Thank you for joining us. Join us Monday for the inauguration of Donald Trump. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5CbbmsLE8&t=1728.16s)]
