# Marco Rubio blasts USAID, says he is agency's acting administrator
**CBS News:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g)
*  Welcome in. I'm Hugo Deepwe. Lots of moving pieces for the government's lead agency for humanitarian aid. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=0.0s)]
*  Sources now telling us CBS News, telling CBS News rather moments ago that Secretary of State Marco Rubio [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=6.5s)]
*  has been named the acting administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, also known as USAID. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=13.0s)]
*  Let's listen in. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=20.0s)]
*  Look, I mean, my frustration with USAID goes back to my time in Congress. It's a completely unresponsive agency. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=22.0s)]
*  It's supposed to respond to policy directives of the State Department, and it refuses to do so. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=28.0s)]
*  So the functions of USAID, there are a lot of functions of USAID that are going to continue, that are going to be part of American foreign policy, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=35.0s)]
*  but it has to be aligned with American foreign policy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=42.0s)]
*  I said very clearly during my confirmation hearing that every dollar we spend and every program we fund, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=44.0s)]
*  that will be aligned with the national interest of the United States. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=51.0s)]
*  And USAID has a history of sort of ignoring that and deciding that there's somehow a global charity separate from the national interest. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=55.0s)]
*  These are taxpayer dollars. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=62.0s)]
*  And so I'm very troubled by these reports that they've been unwilling to cooperate with people who are asking simple questions about [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=63.0s)]
*  what does this program do, who gets the money, who are our contractors, who's funded. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=70.0s)]
*  And that sort of level of insubordination makes it impossible to conduct a sort of mature and serious review that I think foreign aid writ large should have. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=74.0s)]
*  We're spending taxpayer money here. These are not donor dollars. These are taxpayer dollars. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=84.0s)]
*  And we owe the American people the assurances that every dollar we are spending abroad is being spent on something that furthers our national interest. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=88.0s)]
*  And so far a lot of the people that work at USAID have just simply refused to cooperate. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=98.0s)]
*  Are you currently in charge of USAID? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=102.0s)]
*  I'm the acting director of USAID. I've delegated that authority to someone, but I stay in touch with him. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=104.0s)]
*  And again, our goal was to go in and align our foreign aid to the national interest. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=109.0s)]
*  But if you go to mission after mission and embassy after embassy around the world, you will often find that in many cases USAID is involved in programs that run counter to what we're trying to do in our national strategy with that country or with that region. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=116.0s)]
*  That cannot continue. USAID is not an independent, non-governmental entity. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=129.0s)]
*  It is an entity that spends taxpayer dollars and it needs to spend it, as the statute says, in alignment with the policy directives that they get from the secretary of state, the National Security Council, and the president. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=134.0s)]
*  And it's been 20 or 30 years where people have tried to reform it, and it refuses to reform. It refuses to cooperate. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=145.0s)]
*  When we were in Congress, we couldn't even get answers to basic questions about programs. That will not continue. That's not going to continue. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bXmzcUC8g&t=151.0s)]
