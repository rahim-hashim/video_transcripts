# Largest California wildfires still less than 50% contained, but conditions improving
**CBS News:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro)
*  The National Weather Service says things are starting to look better for firefighting conditions in California. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=0.0s)]
*  Most of the LA area's red flag warnings expired as of Wednesday evening. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=6.0s)]
*  Winds are dying down and the conditions this weekend are expected to be less dry. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=11.0s)]
*  Still, tens of thousands of people remain under evacuation orders. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=16.0s)]
*  Firefighters are making progress containing the Eaton and Palisades fires, but they still have a long way to go. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=20.0s)]
*  By now, nearly 38,000 acres have been scorched between them. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=26.0s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Charlie Demar is live in one of the hardest hit communities we've seen so much of in Altadena. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=31.0s)]
*  Charlie, we're hearing some folks are having trouble getting back to their decimated neighborhoods. What's holding them up? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=36.0s)]
*  And Errol, good morning. That really has been one of the most frustrating parts for residents, is they really haven't been able to see this devastation for themselves. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=45.0s)]
*  Some know that their houses are gone and just want to see it for themselves. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=52.0s)]
*  Others don't know whether their houses are still standing. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=57.0s)]
*  And part of the reason for that is that the search and rescue process is currently underway. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=60.0s)]
*  We have seen crews, especially here in Altadena, going home by home, looking for the deceased, going through the rubble. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=65.0s)]
*  And there's over 7,000 destroyed structures here. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=72.0s)]
*  There's also downed power lines, gas lines that are still open. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=75.0s)]
*  So that is why authorities are keeping residents away. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=79.0s)]
*  But California Governor Gavin Newsom is trying to make it easier for those residents to come back. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=82.0s)]
*  He signed an executive order that is going to address handling a lot of this debris removal, getting this debris out of here first, and then also addressing some of the infrastructure issues, bridges, roads that need to be replaced and looked at because of this fire arrow. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=87.0s)]
*  All right. We'll keep checking in with you as this continues to unfold. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=102.0s)]
*  Charlie, thanks. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=106.0s)]
*  The woman who had to be rescued at the height of the Palisades fire just got to speak to the firefighter who saved her. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=107.0s)]
*  You see, Patti Phillips was driving down a hill last week and it was tough to see where she was going because of all of the smoke and fire. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=114.0s)]
*  She drove her car around over a boulder and as you see right here became stuck. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=121.0s)]
*  I thought I was going to die. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=127.0s)]
*  I was praying to God to let me die from smoke inhalation and please don't let me be burned alive. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=129.0s)]
*  Phillips called 911 for help and texted her family. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=136.0s)]
*  I love you. I'm in big trouble. My car won't move. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=140.0s)]
*  Just imagine that half an hour later, a fire truck arrived. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=143.0s)]
*  A firefighter named Malcolm saved her and it turns out that was L.A. County Fire Captain Malcolm Dix. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=147.0s)]
*  She wanted to get in touch with him to thank him after CBS News Los Angeles did the story. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=152.0s)]
*  They came. They each saw each other face to face over the phone. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=157.0s)]
*  I'm alive today because of your heroism. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=162.0s)]
*  I'll be excited to see her again and see the husband and the dog. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=167.0s)]
*  And I'm just glad they made it out safe because unfortunately a lot of other people didn't. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=170.0s)]
*  Phillips and Captain Dix are planning to reunite, but it'll be a while before they do. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=175.0s)]
*  He, of course, still has his hands full with those ongoing fires. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATZM8Vw1Ro&t=180.0s)]
