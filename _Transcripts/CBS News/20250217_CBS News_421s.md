# Delta plane upside down in Toronto after landing incident | Special Report
**CBS News:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA)
*  This is a CBS News special report. I'm John Dickerson in New York. We are coming on the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=0.0s)]
*  air with breaking news. There has been an incident involving a Delta Airlines flight into Toronto. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=4.72s)]
*  Flight 4819 appears to have flipped over following landing. The Toronto Pearson airport released a [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=11.44s)]
*  statement on X saying, quote, emergency teams are responding. All passengers and crew are accounted [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=19.44s)]
*  for. The flight originated from Minneapolis, St. Paul. Senior transportation correspondent [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=25.119999999999997s)]
*  Chris Van Cleave joins me now. Chris, what do we know? Well, John, we understand that some federal [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=29.84s)]
*  officials are hearing reports of some injuries here, but again, the airport says everyone is [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=38.48s)]
*  accounted for. There are images trickling out that show this CRJ 900, which is a regional jet. It was [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=44.16s)]
*  operated by Delta's regional carrier Endeavour, but operating as a Delta flight. The plane appears [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=51.76s)]
*  to be upside down. The wings and tail ripped off the nose landing gear still still in place. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=56.4s)]
*  People are being taken off the airplane. Medical crews have responded in Toronto. The Toronto [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=64.72s)]
*  Pearson airport had gotten a significant amount of snow over the last week. In fact, over the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=70.08s)]
*  weekend, they were working quite hard to clear. It had been about seven inches of snow going into [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=75.28s)]
*  yesterday. So weather conditions, there will be something that will certainly be looked at here. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=79.84s)]
*  But we're looking at another U.S. airliner. This one operated as a Delta connection flight [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=85.12s)]
*  that had an accident while or shortly after landing in this case in Toronto. We don't know [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=92.16s)]
*  how many people are on board yet, but the airport says everyone is accounted for. We hear that there [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=98.4s)]
*  may be some injuries, but it does look like the cabin of the airplane, the passenger area, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=103.92s)]
*  the plane remained intact fully when whatever went wrong went wrong. And it went wrong with [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=109.68s)]
*  enough force. It appears to have ripped the wings and the tail off the airplane, and it came to rest [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  there on a runway in Toronto. Obviously, this is an unfolding situation. A lot of questions [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  about how this could have happened. You know, what could have resulted in this plane essentially [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=127.76s)]
*  flipping over as it was touching down or shortly after touching down from Minneapolis, St. Paul. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  Chris, is there anything in that terminology all are accounted for that we should take any clues [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=137.84s)]
*  from or that can be put into any further context? Or are they just literally trying to give us the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=145.12s)]
*  limit of what they know without trying to get ahead of themselves, which is also something we won't do? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=150.64s)]
*  I think it's that. I think it's an effort to not get ahead of themselves. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=157.04s)]
*  We don't know how many people were on this aircraft. The airport says passengers and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=162.24s)]
*  crew all accounted for. Certainly, they're going to have to be assessed for injuries. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=166.72s)]
*  It would be almost unfathomable to think that no one was hurt in this kind of accident. So there [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=170.16s)]
*  will likely be some injuries. We are hearing that federal authorities are receiving some reports or [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=176.4s)]
*  some indications there were injuries. Because this incident happened in Canada, the Canadian [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=181.44s)]
*  version of the NTSB will lead this investigation. I've spoken with the U.S. NTSB. They are aware of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=186.48s)]
*  this incident. They will essentially be invited to join as a party. They will contribute whatever [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=193.04s)]
*  investigators or research investigative power that the Canadian equivalent may need. But [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=200.32s)]
*  this will be led by the Canadians with the NTSB assisting wherever they can here. You know, John, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=208.0s)]
*  this comes after a real startling period of aviation accidents involving U.S. aircraft. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=215.2s)]
*  If we think back, barely three weeks ago, you had the midair collision over Washington, D.C. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=222.39999999999998s)]
*  That killed 67 people. Two days later, you had that Learjet crash in Philadelphia in spectacular [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=227.92s)]
*  fashion, caught on camera. We saw that. That killed six people on board, one person on the ground, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  ten people in assessment citation flying in Alaska en route to Nome. And then just last week [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=239.68s)]
*  here in the Phoenix area, that plane that had a landing gear collapse on landing and crashed into [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  another plane, that killed at least one person and injured several others. Now we have this incident, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=250.64s)]
*  which, you know, fingers crossed, we are hoping what the airport means by accounted for is that [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=255.92s)]
*  everybody survived this crash. But we just don't know that. And we don't know the extent of any [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=260.8s)]
*  injuries just yet. Chris Van Cleave, senior transportation correspondent. Thank you very [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=265.04s)]
*  much, Chris. We're now going to talk to transportation safety expert and analyst Robert [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=269.92s)]
*  Sumwalt who joins us. Mr. Sumwalt served as the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=273.6s)]
*  What's your first reaction to this? CRJ 900. Chris reports the tail and wings have been [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=281.04s)]
*  sheared off. It's upside down. Your thoughts? Well, I think my first thoughts, John, are I'm [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=289.28s)]
*  glad to hear that everyone is accounted for. And hopefully, as you indicated, hopefully that does [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  mean that everybody is at least okay. And what's what does it suggest anything to you that it's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  that the plane is upside down? And obviously, we don't want to speculate about things [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=308.88s)]
*  beyond the pictures that we're seeing, but or go too far. But but a plane being upside down [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=313.36s)]
*  on on the tarmac there, does that suggest anything to you? Well, I think, as Chris indicated, it's a [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=321.2s)]
*  lot of snow there and on the airport. And I think that, you know, the airport could have been [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=329.04s)]
*  sliding and then somehow or another gone off the runway and gone upside down. So it's really, as [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=334.0s)]
*  you know, it's just a lot of speculation at this point. And we won't and we won't go any [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=339.2s)]
*  farther than that. Help me understand the coordination with the Canadian version of the NTSB. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=344.24s)]
*  Chris says they'll be taking the lead. But obviously, since the flight originated in [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=349.52s)]
*  in the states, I would assume there's a protocol for NTSB working hand in hand with them. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you're exactly right. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada does an excellent job, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=361.36s)]
*  and the NTSB will be invited in as an accredited representative since it is a U.S. registered [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=367.28s)]
*  airplane and U.S. operated airplane. NTSB will be invited in. So they will work hand in hand [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  together to to determine what happened here and most importantly, come up with recommendations [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=381.11999999999995s)]
*  to keep something like this from happening again. All right, Robert Somald, former chair of the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=386.96s)]
*  National Transportation Safety Board, thank you so much. Just to recap here, a plane landing at [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=391.52s)]
*  Toronto airport has flipped over. The airport says all passengers and crew are accounted for. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=397.52s)]
*  That's what we know at the moment. Our coverage will continue on CBS News 24-7, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirf9KM1FdA&t=404.64s)]
