# Trump says Zelenskyy "overplayed his hand" after contentious meeting
**CBS News:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw)
*  The President is a former president of the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=0.0s)]
*  He's the president of the United States. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=6.0s)]
*  He's the president of the United States. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=8.0s)]
*  So, thank you very much. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=10.0s)]
*  So, I just want to say we're going down to Florida. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=12.0s)]
*  We have a big event tomorrow night. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=14.0s)]
*  A big MAGA event, Make America Great Again. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=16.0s)]
*  And it's setting records and otherwise I'd rather be right now at the White House. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=20.0s)]
*  But we're doing the big event tomorrow night. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=25.0s)]
*  We had some big news this week, as you know, because Apple is investing $500 billion. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=28.0s)]
*  Think of that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=36.0s)]
*  And that's going to be a tremendous investment. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=38.0s)]
*  I guess the biggest investment anybody's ever made in the country at one time. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=42.0s)]
*  But they're going to be investing a lot of money, $500 billion. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=46.0s)]
*  We have many other companies that just announced they're coming in. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=50.0s)]
*  A lot of it's because of how we're doing. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=54.0s)]
*  We've done a great turnaround in a little more than 30 days. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=56.0s)]
*  But the country's really doing well. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=60.0s)]
*  Really doing well. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=62.0s)]
*  We're respected again all over the world. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=64.0s)]
*  If you look, we had the Japanese prime minister. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=66.0s)]
*  We had the prime minister yesterday of UK, as you know. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=68.0s)]
*  We had the prime minister of India. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=72.0s)]
*  We have another 20 prime ministers and presidents wanting to come. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=74.0s)]
*  And very good. Very good. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=78.0s)]
*  I think our country's really turned around. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=82.0s)]
*  We had a meeting today, as you know, with President Zelensky. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=84.0s)]
*  And I would say it didn't work out exactly great from his standpoint. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=87.0s)]
*  I think he very much overplayed his hand. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=92.0s)]
*  We're looking for peace. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=95.0s)]
*  We're not looking for somebody that's going to sign up a strong power [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=97.0s)]
*  and then not make peace because they feel emboldened. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=100.0s)]
*  And that's what I saw happening. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=103.0s)]
*  I'm looking for peace. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=105.0s)]
*  We're not looking to go into a 10-year war and play games. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=106.0s)]
*  We want peace. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=111.0s)]
*  And it was just my impression that if we do that, if we sign up, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=113.0s)]
*  he's looking for something that I'm not looking for. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=117.0s)]
*  He's looking to go on and fight, fight, fight. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=120.0s)]
*  We're looking to end the death. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=123.0s)]
*  Two thousand people died this week. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=126.0s)]
*  Soldiers, more than that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=129.0s)]
*  But two thousand, approximately, people died this week. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=131.0s)]
*  Young Ukrainians and Russians. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=135.0s)]
*  And somebody would say, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=138.0s)]
*  I don't care about Ukraine and Russian soldiers. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=140.0s)]
*  I care about them. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=143.0s)]
*  I care about everybody. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=145.0s)]
*  And we're not doing that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=147.0s)]
*  Now, if we don't do anything, he's going to have to make peace, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=150.0s)]
*  but he's dealing with a very weak set of cards. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=153.0s)]
*  If we sign, he's dealing with a very strong set of cards, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=156.0s)]
*  and then he doesn't want to make peace. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=159.0s)]
*  So that's where we are. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=161.0s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=162.0s)]
*  I'm not looking to get into anything protracted. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=163.0s)]
*  I want immediate peace. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=166.0s)]
*  The President is going to want to make, and he wants to make, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=168.0s)]
*  he wants to end it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=171.0s)]
*  And you saw what I saw today. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=173.0s)]
*  This is a man that wants to get us signed up and keep fighting. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=175.0s)]
*  And we're not doing that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=179.0s)]
*  Not for this country. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=181.0s)]
*  So we're setting a lot of records. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=182.0s)]
*  Economically, we're setting records, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=184.0s)]
*  and I think every way we're setting records. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=186.0s)]
*  One of the best is the right track, Rome track. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=189.0s)]
*  You saw that. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=192.0s)]
*  We're on the right track for the first time in over 27 years. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=193.0s)]
*  People are impressed with that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=198.0s)]
*  The other thing is the feeling about our country. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=201.0s)]
*  The feeling is great. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=205.0s)]
*  It's up 48 percent on feeling on business. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=207.0s)]
*  And that's the record we've never had. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=211.0s)]
*  There's never been a record where we've ever gone up that much [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=214.0s)]
*  in such a short period of time. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=218.0s)]
*  So we're doing really well. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=220.0s)]
*  And I guess some of you are coming with us. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=222.0s)]
*  And if you are, I hope you're going to have a good flight. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=226.0s)]
*  The Press. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=228.0s)]
*  What? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=229.0s)]
*  What is the President going to do to keep the peace [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=232.0s)]
*  going across the country? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=234.0s)]
*  He's got to say, I want to make peace. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=235.0s)]
*  He doesn't have to stand there and say about Putin this, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=237.0s)]
*  Putin that, all negative things. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=241.0s)]
*  He's got to say, I want to make peace. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=244.0s)]
*  I don't want to fight a war any longer. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=246.0s)]
*  His people are dying. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=248.0s)]
*  He doesn't have the cards, just so you understand it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=249.0s)]
*  Okay? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=252.0s)]
*  I can tell you what he's going to do. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=253.0s)]
*  The Press. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=254.0s)]
*  What do you think the White House will do? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=255.0s)]
*  I don't have to tell you that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=259.0s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=261.0s)]
*  I think you know the answer to it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=262.0s)]
*  What? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=264.0s)]
*  What do I know? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=265.0s)]
*  The Press. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=266.0s)]
*  Do you trust him? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=267.0s)]
*  Do you trust him? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=268.0s)]
*  Do you want to let him go? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=269.0s)]
*  Look, I don't trust or distrust anybody. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=271.0s)]
*  I just want to get a deal done. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=274.0s)]
*  And if the deal happens, good. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=276.0s)]
*  But you can't embolden somebody that does not have the cards. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=278.0s)]
*  And all of a sudden that person says, oh, well, now I can keep fighting. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=282.0s)]
*  We're not going to keep fighting. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=285.0s)]
*  We're going to get the war done or let them go and see what happens. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=287.0s)]
*  Let them fight it out. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=291.0s)]
*  The Press. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=292.0s)]
*  Do you want Biden to step down? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=293.0s)]
*  Do you want Biden to make the call? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=294.0s)]
*  I want anybody that's going to make peace. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=296.0s)]
*  If he's capable of making peace, which he may or may not be, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=299.0s)]
*  but I want somebody that's going to make peace. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=303.0s)]
*  Again, he doesn't have the cards. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=305.0s)]
*  When we sign up, he's got all of the cards. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=308.0s)]
*  That doesn't mean he can fight. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=310.0s)]
*  He's got to stop the fighting, stop the death. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=312.0s)]
*  He's losing hundreds of thousands of soldiers. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=316.0s)]
*  It's time to stop the death. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=319.0s)]
*  The Press. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=322.0s)]
*  How long do you think he can take? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=323.0s)]
*  How long do you think he can take from now? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=326.0s)]
*  Why does he think he might have to come back? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=329.0s)]
*  Well, he says he wants it now. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=331.0s)]
*  He wants to come back right now, but I can't do that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=333.0s)]
*  Do you want an immediate ceasefire? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=336.0s)]
*  Do you want an immediate ceasefire? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=338.0s)]
*  They should have an immediate ceasefire. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=340.0s)]
*  That was the other thing. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=342.0s)]
*  He didn't want to do about ceasefire. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=343.0s)]
*  A ceasefire could take place immediately. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=345.0s)]
*  A contract, if you want to end the war, you sign up an agreement, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=348.0s)]
*  that's going to take a period of time. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=352.0s)]
*  It takes time. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=354.0s)]
*  I want it to end immediately. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=355.0s)]
*  And I think if you had a ceasefire, it would be a ceasefire, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=357.0s)]
*  a real one that would end it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=360.0s)]
*  He doesn't want to do that? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=362.0s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=363.0s)]
*  Do what better to do. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=364.0s)]
*  I want it to end immediately. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=366.0s)]
*  I want a ceasefire now. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=368.0s)]
*  He said, oh, I don't want a ceasefire. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=370.0s)]
*  Well, all of a sudden, he's a big shot because he has the U.S. on his side. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=372.0s)]
*  Either we're going to end it or let him fight it out. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=377.0s)]
*  And if he fights it out, it's not going to be pretty. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=379.0s)]
*  Because without it, without us, he doesn't win. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=382.0s)]
*  Let me tell you. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=385.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter what I'm considering. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=391.0s)]
*  I'm just telling you. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=393.0s)]
*  You saw what I saw today. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=394.0s)]
*  That was not a man that wanted to make peace. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=396.0s)]
*  And I'm only interested if he wants to end the bloodshed. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=398.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=402.0s)]
*  That was President Trump on the South Lawn of the White House [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=406.0s)]
*  after what can only be described as a contentious meeting [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=409.0s)]
*  in the Oval Office with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=413.0s)]
*  He said, Zelensky, you just heard him, overplayed his hand [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=416.0s)]
*  and is dealing with a weak set of cards. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=419.0s)]
*  The president said repeatedly he wants Zelensky to stop the fighting, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=422.0s)]
*  to end the war. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=428.0s)]
*  It's worth noting, for history's sake, that Ukraine is not the aggressor in this. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=430.0s)]
*  And if the war were to end, Russia would have a lot to say about that. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=435.0s)]
*  It could stop bombing, sending missiles and other munitions and soldiers into Ukraine. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=439.0s)]
*  It could stop the war instantly. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=444.0s)]
*  As all this has gone on for the last couple of weeks, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=446.0s)]
*  the Russians have done quite the opposite, accelerating and intensifying missiles, bombs, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=448.0s)]
*  and fighting in the battle space in eastern Ukraine. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=454.0s)]
*  I want to bring in our chief White House correspondent, Nancy Cordes, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=458.0s)]
*  alongside our political panel. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=461.0s)]
*  Chuck Rocha, who you might well remember, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=463.0s)]
*  formerly served as senior advisor on Senator Bernie Sanders' [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=465.0s)]
*  2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=467.0s)]
*  and Danielle Alvarez, senior advisor on President Trump's 2024 campaigns. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=470.0s)]
*  Great to have all of you with us. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=475.0s)]
*  Nancy, you were just out there on the South On. Is that right? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=476.0s)]
*  I was, and I asked President Trump what Zelensky would need to do to restart talks [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=479.0s)]
*  after things went so disastrously off the rails today. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=486.0s)]
*  And what President Trump just said, you played it out there, is he's got to say, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=490.0s)]
*  I want to make peace. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=494.0s)]
*  He can't stand there and say Putin this, Putin that, all negative things. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=495.0s)]
*  He has to say, I don't want to fight a war any longer. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=500.0s)]
*  He doesn't have the cards. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=504.0s)]
*  President Trump, again and again in that Q&A with reporters, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=506.0s)]
*  said that he wants a ceasefire immediately. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=510.0s)]
*  He wants to end the war immediately. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=513.0s)]
*  And he seemed to be suggesting that Zelensky is holding out for things [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=515.0s)]
*  that he thinks would drag peace talks out too long, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=520.0s)]
*  and also that he thinks Zelensky doesn't have the leverage to ask for. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=525.0s)]
*  So basically, he seemed to be suggesting [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=530.0s)]
*  that Zelensky's got to take what he can get from me, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=532.0s)]
*  or I'm not interested in restarting talks. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=534.0s)]
*  Danielle Alvarez, your assessment of this day [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=537.0s)]
*  and where relations stand between the U.S. and Ukraine. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=541.0s)]
*  Here's what I'll say, and I've been fortunate to be in the room with President Trump [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=547.0s)]
*  as, you know, seeing him being fierce and relentless in negotiations. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=551.0s)]
*  He's going to do what is best for the American people, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=555.0s)]
*  and he's going to do what he promised on the campaign trail, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=558.0s)]
*  and that is bring peace through strength. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=560.0s)]
*  What you heard him say on the South Lawn was exactly that. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=563.0s)]
*  What he wants to make sure is that both nations can come to the table, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=566.0s)]
*  and it's hard to bring both to the table when each is the aggressor of the other. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=570.0s)]
*  Of course, Russia being the initial aggressor of Ukraine, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=575.0s)]
*  but Ukraine also has to want to strike a deal, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=578.0s)]
*  cannot make a deal and have an ally with America and the American people [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=581.0s)]
*  only to bring us to war. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=586.0s)]
*  We know that the American people don't want that. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=588.0s)]
*  They don't want to continue to spend billions of taxpayer dollars [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=590.0s)]
*  not only on an endless war, but on a war between other nations. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=594.0s)]
*  Danielle, do you think it matters to President Trump or the White House [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=599.0s)]
*  that immediately after this confrontation with Zelensky, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=602.0s)]
*  prominent members of the Russian government began to applaud the president [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=606.0s)]
*  and call Zelensky, among other things, an insolent pig who got slapped down? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=611.0s)]
*  I mean, to have immediate Kremlin applause for an American president [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=616.0s)]
*  dealing with a situation like that, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=620.0s)]
*  do you think that lands well with the president or senior advisors? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=622.0s)]
*  I think that the president, again, is focused on what is best for America. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=626.0s)]
*  He is trying to bring both parties to the table, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=631.0s)]
*  and both parties have to want to get to peace, have to want to end this war. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=634.0s)]
*  And what we can't have is President Zelensky entering the White House, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=641.0s)]
*  entering the West Wing, sitting in the Oval Office, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=644.0s)]
*  trying to use the American media to promote his propaganda, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=647.0s)]
*  and trying to bring America into this fight and bring it into war, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=651.0s)]
*  when again, the deal is very clear. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=655.0s)]
*  President Trump will get involved and will deliver peace [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=657.0s)]
*  should both nations want to reach that agreement. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=660.0s)]
*  Very quickly, Danielle, what was propagandistic about what Zelensky said? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=663.0s)]
*  He wanted to rehash everything that has happened, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=669.0s)]
*  and what we need to do is move forward. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=672.0s)]
*  President Trump, again, has said that he will not continue to support chaos abroad. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=674.0s)]
*  He will not continue to support war. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=681.0s)]
*  And the same way that he was able to strike a deal between Israel and Hamas and a ceasefire, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=683.0s)]
*  he is very focused on making sure that the same can be accomplished between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=688.0s)]
*  He said it on the campaign trail. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=694.0s)]
*  He has not wavered from his commitment, and that is to stop the loss of lives. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=696.0s)]
*  And in order to do that, America is going to make sure that everyone can have a seat at the table [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=701.0s)]
*  and is going to make sure that the end result is peace, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=706.0s)]
*  and President Trump will not waver from that. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=709.0s)]
*  Chuck, your thoughts? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=712.0s)]
*  Contentious. Contentious is an understatement. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=713.0s)]
*  Where I come from, anybody gets that loud and that close to you, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=716.0s)]
*  normally there's some furniture moving around. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=719.0s)]
*  Let me just say this. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=721.0s)]
*  The only one who won today was a dictator in Russia. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=722.0s)]
*  We have to support the folks that are our friends. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=726.0s)]
*  That's why they're called allies. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=729.0s)]
*  Do we need to give every bit of dollars that we have to every foreign country? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=730.0s)]
*  I could not disagree with what's being said on the Internet right now. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=733.0s)]
*  There's a way to be an adult. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=737.0s)]
*  And if you watch today, if you go back and watch that again, watch JD Vance. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=738.0s)]
*  This thing was almost over. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=742.0s)]
*  We were going to get something done. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=744.0s)]
*  And then he was like, no, no, no, no. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=745.0s)]
*  I want to go in and poke the bears and blow this whole thing up. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=747.0s)]
*  And he did exactly what he wanted to. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=750.0s)]
*  And then we went on this rampage. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=752.0s)]
*  Things are really tough when you have folks coming after each other. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=754.0s)]
*  But there's a way through history to act like a president, act like you're in head of this country, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=758.0s)]
*  and make sure you're not putting America's lives. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=763.0s)]
*  I want to fight the Russians over there. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=765.0s)]
*  I don't want to fight the Russians right here. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=767.0s)]
*  Do you think when President Zelensky said the United States might feel threatened by Russia in the future [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=769.0s)]
*  and President Trump jumped in and said, don't tell us what we're going to feel, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=776.0s)]
*  that there was something about what Zelensky said that bruised President Trump's sense of America first ego? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=780.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=787.0s)]
*  Donald Trump ain't never been in a fight in his whole life. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=788.0s)]
*  And when you poke at a bully, it makes him upset. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=790.0s)]
*  And that's exactly what he did because he said the same thing that a lot of folks have said [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=792.0s)]
*  all around the national security apparatus is sure there's an ocean there. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=796.0s)]
*  That's why we want to fight the war on the other side of it. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=800.0s)]
*  Nancy Cordes, Chuck Rocha and Danielle Alvarez. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=802.0s)]
*  Thank you very, very much. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v10EdrIrIfw&t=807.0s)]
