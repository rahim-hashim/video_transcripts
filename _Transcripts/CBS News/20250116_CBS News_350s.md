# Options Trump could have to potentially stop the TikTok ban
**CBS News:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI)
*  Welcome back to CBS News 24 seven tick tock for social media giant tick tock's future in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=0.0s)]
*  United States. So we are in the midst of knowing that there is a nationwide ban that could be just [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=4.48s)]
*  days away at play. That is unless the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes or an American buyer swoops in [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=10.0s)]
*  at the 11th hour really to rescue the app. If that doesn't happen tick tock will go dark in [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  the palm of your hand Sunday. Some tick tockers hope that President-elect Donald Trump will use [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=20.32s)]
*  presidential powers to rescue the app. But because of that this very much caught our eye. Tick tock's [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=25.76s)]
*  CEO plans to attend Trump's inauguration. In fact he's not alone. A lot of big tech leaders are [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=31.6s)]
*  lining up to attend the president-elect swearing in. Tesla's Elon Musk, Metta's Mark Zuckerberg, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=37.28s)]
*  Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Open AIs Sam Altman all expected to attend. Senator Mark Warner shared his [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=43.36s)]
*  thoughts about tick tock's looming ban. Here's a listen. I don't get it. 80 percent of the congress [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=50.88s)]
*  democrats and republicans agreed that tick tock is a huge national security concern. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=57.2s)]
*  I can't think of a potentially more powerful propaganda tool. Now tick tock's creativity is [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  great. I think influencers they ought to be able to continue. All we're looking for is a way to say [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=68.4s)]
*  at the end of the day tick tock ought to be controlled not by an entity that pays first [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=73.84s)]
*  allegiance to the communist party of china and the irony in all this was donald trump was the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=78.48s)]
*  first guy to point out this problem matter of fact his administration had to convince me they [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=84.0s)]
*  did a great job of convincing me and the overwhelming members of congress so um we'll see. So this [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  influences a lot of people who make money on tick tock so let's go live to cbs news money watch [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  correspondent kelly o'grady hi kelly nice to have you here today so what could donald trump do to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=100.72s)]
*  help prevent tick tock from going dark in the palm of our hands because we know [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=106.48s)]
*  in recent weeks he has warmed up to tick tock quite a bit [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=110.72s)]
*  yeah i mean he saw a lot of success during his campaign read on the app and and that does seem [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=115.76s)]
*  to have changed his opinion about whether it should continue to exist he's even said he [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=121.2s)]
*  has a soft spot for the app and of course as you mentioned the ceo will be at the inauguration [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=126.48s)]
*  there's a lot of talk about a potential executive order that he could sign now i actually spoke to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  a number of legal experts today about whether that would have teeth and there is some concern that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=137.36s)]
*  that wouldn't actually do a lot and and the reason is that the president's word [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=143.28s)]
*  some legal experts are saying wouldn't overcome a bill that has been approved by congress and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=147.68s)]
*  that had bipartisan support i mean many members in his own party were very much for banning the app [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=154.08s)]
*  for national security reasons i also thought it was very interesting yesterday in pam bondy who [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=160.24s)]
*  is president-elect trump's pick for attorney general she had her hearing which is ongoing today [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=165.68s)]
*  she declined to comment on whether she would commit to enforcing the legislation that is going [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=170.8s)]
*  to ban tick tock on sunday so you're kind of seeing some cracks i mean we we do know that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  there does seem to be momentum in order to try and make sure that tick tock is not banned there's a [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=182.56s)]
*  bipartisan effort to delay this an act that has been put forth by 270 days but as of now [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=189.2s)]
*  that executive order talk it doesn't seem like it would be very clear cut read okay so we will stay [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=196.72s)]
*  tuned we know you'll bring it and break it right here on cbs news 24 7 i want to switch gears a [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=202.88s)]
*  little bit we know that president trump's cabinet picks are going through confirmation hearings yet [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=206.88s)]
*  again today one we want to ask you about and that is u.s secretary rick scott pick scott besant [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=211.44s)]
*  we want to roll some sound and then talk to you on the other side of this let's listen [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  today i believe that president trump has a generational opportunity to unleash a new economic [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=223.67999999999998s)]
*  golden age that will create more jobs wealth and prosperity for all americans new golden age for [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=231.83999999999997s)]
*  all americans but kelly we know the devil really is in the details what are the details or do we [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=240.64s)]
*  even know what the specific one-by-one plan is here so actually in his hearing he did emphasize [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=245.84s)]
*  that ensuring that those tax cuts that were first put in place under the trump administration that [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  those are renewed because they are coming up this year that's been a very big talk and i'll actually [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=260.48s)]
*  read you a quote from his hearing he said quote if we do not renew and extend then we will be facing [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=266.16s)]
*  an economic calamity so very different than a golden age so we do know that that's going to [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=271.12s)]
*  be the first order of business for him and and certainly many folks in the republican party [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=275.44s)]
*  after monday the other thing that we do know is what he has said is the 333 plan so in interviews [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=280.72s)]
*  leading up to his announcement as the pick he said he wants to reduce the federal budget deficit to [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=287.92s)]
*  three percent of gross domestic product gdp also wants to get real gdp growth to three percent [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=294.56s)]
*  and produce an additional three million barrels of oil a day by 2028 so certainly if he's able [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=300.96s)]
*  to achieve those things there would be economic growth it could be a golden age read i think [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=307.12s)]
*  though the budget deficit getting that to three percent of gdp just for context right now we're [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=312.32s)]
*  about six and a half percent so that would require a lot of spending cuts we do have the department [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=318.8s)]
*  of governmental efficiency that's going to be doing a lot of that but a lot of the folks and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=324.4s)]
*  i'm talking to they're very concerned about where those cuts would come and if that would [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=328.72s)]
*  actually stifle economic growth on the whole besant's looked at as measured he's respected [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=332.32000000000005s)]
*  by the investor community so there is a lot of excitement but as you say the devil is in the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  details and we will be watching it kelly o'grady cbs news money watch correspondent always great [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tj4E4f3kJI&t=342.56s)]
