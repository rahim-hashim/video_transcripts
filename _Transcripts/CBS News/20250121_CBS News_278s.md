# These Jan. 6 rioters are out of prison after Trump pardons
**CBS News:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U)
*  So let's go deeper now, specifically on the pardons that President Trump issued for those January 6 people who were convicted. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=0.0s)]
*  CBS News Homeland Security correspondent Nicole Skanga was at the Capitol that day, saw the actions of those insurrectionists. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=8.0s)]
*  Trump now calls them hostages. Many went to jail over this. Many pled guilty. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=14.56s)]
*  So the big question, how does this work and when will they be released? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=19.76s)]
*  Yeah, some have already been released. Read just last night, two brothers convicted in connection to that Capitol attack became really the first of the rioters to be freed. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=22.56s)]
*  Andrew and Matthew Valentin. They're from Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, and they were released from the D.C. jail. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=34.0s)]
*  There was a big crowd outside. We had a CBS News team on the ground. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=38.92s)]
*  Both had previously pled guilty to two counts each of assaulting police. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  And Andrew's plea included, you know, one count of assaulting police with a dangerous weapon. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  He had allegedly struck an officer with a thrown folding chair and he was convicted and sentenced to jail time. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=52.28s)]
*  The Trump administration officials actually made the announcement outside of the D.C. jail last night, adding that Elon Musk, the ex and tech billionaire, was the quote unquote mastermind behind their sort of sudden freedom. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=61.28s)]
*  Trump also, though, commuted the sentences for 14 other defendants, and that includes Stuart Rhodes. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=76.76s)]
*  He was the former leader of the Oath Keepers militia. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=83.4s)]
*  He had received the second longest sentence for his role in the riot, a whopping 18 years. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=86.84s)]
*  And Rhodes actually left a federal prison in Cumberland, Maryland, early this morning. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=92.92s)]
*  As for the future releases, they're ongoing and we expect even more today. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=97.6s)]
*  Trump ordered his attorney general, currently acting attorney general, to make sure that those who are currently held in prison are, quote, released immediately. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=101.84s)]
*  And also, by the way, to dismiss all of those pending indictments, too. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=111.84s)]
*  Wow. What are you hearing on Capitol Hill from lawmakers here, especially through the lens of precedent? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=116.48s)]
*  Yeah, well, with the stroke of a pen, the legal consequences, you know, the largest criminal probe in American history virtually undone. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=124.2s)]
*  You know, you mentioned that the sweeping pardon includes those who assaulted police officers, those who were convicted of really a historic crime of seditious conspiracy, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=134.32s)]
*  which, to remind our viewers, means that two or more people literally conspired to overthrow the federal government by force. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=143.88s)]
*  We've seen some criticism by Republicans. Senator Tom Tillis speaking out this morning. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=151.28s)]
*  Others have really shifted their view on this when asked about the pardon. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=156.4s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader John Thune today pointing the finger back at former President Joe Biden, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=159.88s)]
*  stating that the former president opened the floodgates by pardoning his own son, Hunter. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=165.44s)]
*  But we should also point out in this all read that this is not what Trump administration officials, transition officials, had signaled. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=170.84s)]
*  In fact, just a week ago, you know, then vice president elect J.D. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=178.4s)]
*  Vance said that Trump, quote, obviously would not pardon those who committed violence last week. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=182.28s)]
*  Trump's pick for attorney general Pam Bonding, Pam, Pam Bondi, excuse me, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=188.88000000000002s)]
*  while testifying on the Hill said that while she wasn't going to speak for the president, he, quote, does not like people who abuse police officers either. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=193.4s)]
*  You know, obviously, this blanket pardon stands in direct contradiction to that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=201.96s)]
*  We also know that you have some fresh reporting on the killing of a border agent yesterday. Where did it happen? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=207.68s)]
*  What's the news there, Nicole? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, a U.S. Border Patrol agent fatally shot yesterday on a highway in northern Vermont, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=215.4s)]
*  south of the Canadian border authorities, confirmed to us, and that death was confirmed by not only the FBI, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=221.36s)]
*  but the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Benjamin Huffman, in Washington, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=227.60000000000002s)]
*  really just moments after he assumed that position. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  And in a statement, the FBI said that in addition to that agent, there was a suspect in the shooting who was also killed and a second suspect who was wounded and then later taken into custody. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=237.67999999999998s)]
*  And that encounter happened along Interstate I-91 in Coventry, about 20 miles from the Canadian border. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=248.39999999999998s)]
*  The FBI said there was no ongoing threat there, so some relief for the public. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=255.12s)]
*  But they have launched an investigation, as they do, into any law enforcement death. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=259.96s)]
*  So has the Department of Homeland Security. And so we await further details on that read. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=264.64s)]
*  Nicole Skanga, thank you so much for your live report and streaming with us from our nation's capital. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=269.2s)]
*  We know it's been a busy week for you and will likely continue to be a busy week. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsNQdTuK8U&t=273.64s)]
