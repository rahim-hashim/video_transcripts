# Zelenskyy meets U.S. envoy to Ukraine and Russia after Trump calls him a dictator
**CBS News:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA)
*  Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky has met with US officials one day now after, you could call it a war of words, escalated with President Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=0.0s)]
*  Yesterday, the president described Zelensky as a dictator, accusing him of duping America into providing billions of dollars in assistance. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=9.28s)]
*  A dictator without elections, Zelensky better move faster. He's not going to have a country left. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=17.36s)]
*  Got to move, got to move fast because that war is going in the wrong direction. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=23.92s)]
*  CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer joins us now live from London with more on this. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=29.12s)]
*  Liz Zelensky says he's supposed to meet with Trump's special envoy to Ukraine and Russia in Kiev today. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  And I believe we're just learning there's a planned press conference that has been canceled per a US request. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=41.04s)]
*  This is according to Kiev. Bring us up to speed on these latest developments. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=47.04s)]
*  Well, retired General Keith Kellogg has been there. He arrived yesterday and has been there today. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=51.28s)]
*  We have no idea what they've discussed or even who was present at the meetings. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  General Kellogg went in with a fairly dovish position. He said, I'm going to listen. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  I do recognize that Ukraine wants security guarantees that will be written into a peace agreement. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=71.6s)]
*  So very much in contrast to what we've been hearing from President Trump, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=80.4s)]
*  why the press conference today was canceled is anybody's guess. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=85.04s)]
*  Look, it could be that there's just nothing to report. They haven't been able to come to any [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  constructive agreement. But equally, it could be that General Kellogg is trying to keep his head [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  below the parapet while these furious salvos are issuing from President Trump in America. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=100.72s)]
*  And he doesn't want to say anything to inflame the president even further. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=108.48s)]
*  We were just looking at some live pictures of Zelensky meeting with the US envoy. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=113.44s)]
*  We just lost some of it as we were chatting with you, Liz, but all of this happening in real time. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=117.84s)]
*  And President Trump is warning Zelensky to, quote, move fast toward reaching a deal. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=122.56s)]
*  I'm wondering how President Zelensky is responding and reacting to what is a sharp turn in US policy [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=128.0s)]
*  toward Ukraine. It's hard to imagine. He must be reeling because this came from nowhere, apparently. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=134.4s)]
*  All the analysts say that speed is going to play into Russia's hands, that a really well-crafted [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  peace agreement should have Ukraine at the table and it will be complex and it will take time. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=152.8s)]
*  And in fact, the Russians have signaled that. They're saying, oh, you know, this is going to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=158.56s)]
*  take some time. It's going to take some setup and so on. When President Trump says [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=163.12s)]
*  Ukrainian President Zelensky has to move fast, it's not clear what he's talking about. I mean, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=168.88s)]
*  Zelensky has been sidelined. So what is he supposed to do quickly? Anybody's guess. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=173.92s)]
*  I want to quickly ask you about Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz reacting to Trump's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=180.32s)]
*  comments, calling them dangerous. Germany is Europe's largest economy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=184.72s)]
*  Scholz is incredibly influential in what happens. What do you make of that? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=190.48s)]
*  Well, I think he's referring to the fact that President Trump called President Zelensky a [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=196.39999999999998s)]
*  dictator and unjustly because it's true, Ukraine didn't have elections when it was meant to last [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=201.67999999999998s)]
*  May. But can you imagine holding elections under these circumstances in the middle of a war with [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=209.6s)]
*  millions of people outside the country? The country is under martial law and under Ukrainian [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=215.36s)]
*  law. If there is martial law, there are no elections. So he was perfectly correct in not [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=220.08s)]
*  holding the election last spring. That's not to say he isn't a leader with huge credibility. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  And I think the Germans are getting at the fact that this is the wrong time to erode President [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  Zelensky's standing internationally by calling him a dictator and erode his credibility with [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=236.0s)]
*  his own people because he's in a tight spot. And he is going to be going into negotiations [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=241.92s)]
*  and asking Ukrainians for compromise. He needs all the credibility he can get right now, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=247.2s)]
*  not being splattered with unjust and unmerited insults. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=253.11999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, uncharted territory here for all involved. Liz Palmer, great to have you with us. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  Joining us from our London bureau. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22iBgRyAJHA&t=265.76s)]
