# Trump plan for Gaza raises several questions
**CBS News:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE)
*  Now, as we've been reporting all morning, President Trump is proposing the U.S. takeover [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=0.0s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=5.4s)]
*  Let's bring in our CBS News senior White House correspondent, Weijia Zhang, to help understand [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=6.4s)]
*  what this really means, Weijia. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=10.6s)]
*  It was really quite a shocking statement. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  How, if this ever comes to fruition, would this work? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=14.84s)]
*  Well, Errol, we don't know how it would work, because there are so many outstanding questions [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=18.36s)]
*  about the legality and about the logistics. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=23.94s)]
*  But I can tell you, President Trump's vision for what he wants to see happen in Gaza, he [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=26.36s)]
*  thinks that the U.S. should own it for a long term and control it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  He says that the country would level off the territory and then rebuild, which he claims [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=36.92s)]
*  would stimulate a new economy and give people a peaceful place to live. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=44.2s)]
*  So essentially, you know, turning this into a real estate development and building from [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=50.8s)]
*  the bottom up. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=56.36s)]
*  But, Errol, you know, there's so many things that the president did not answer. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=57.36s)]
*  For example, what authority he has to take over a sovereign territory and what you do [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=63.08s)]
*  with the some two million Palestinians who currently live there and would be displaced. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=68.4s)]
*  You know, earlier in the day, he said that they should permanently resettle, and he has [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=74.88s)]
*  talked about moving the Palestinians out of there to other places, other countries that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=80.16s)]
*  would be willing to take them. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=86.24s)]
*  But then when he made this proposal, Errol, he also said that eventually after Gaza was [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=88.16s)]
*  rebuilt, everybody would live there, the, quote, world's people, including Palestinians. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=93.52s)]
*  So as you mentioned, this was a stunning idea, one that he hadn't really elaborated on before. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=99.4s)]
*  And it leaves a lot of questions about how it could all work. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=107.44s)]
*  And it strangely enough feeds into the suspicion some people in the region had that Israel's [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=111.44s)]
*  ultimate aim during the war was to clear out Gaza. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=116.48s)]
*  So interesting that this remark will be made during the meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=119.92s)]
*  What else did they discuss? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=124.28s)]
*  Well, this was certainly the top of the agenda, not necessarily this new proposal, but certainly [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=126.32s)]
*  the ceasefire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=133.76s)]
*  And, Errol, just to really add some context here, under the current ceasefire deal, rebuilding [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  Gaza is part of phase three. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=146.0s)]
*  That is the last of three phases of the deal. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=148.56s)]
*  Phase two is the really critical one, because that includes a permanent ceasefire. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=151.84s)]
*  That includes returning all the remaining hostages and withdrawing all IDF troops from [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  Gaza, because before you can talk about rebuilding, you have to talk about how you're going to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=163.68s)]
*  end the war. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=168.16000000000003s)]
*  And that's really not something that the two leaders elaborated on. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, when asked whether he was optimistic that could even happen, Netanyahu said that, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=173.68s)]
*  you know, we'll try to get there. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  And the president said, I don't know if that ceasefire will hold. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=181.44s)]
*  And so it seems like, you know, they are getting ahead of their skis talking about [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=184.84s)]
*  the future of Gaza, when in reality it is still a war-torn area. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=188.28s)]
*  They also talked about Iran, because obviously they're trying to work toward peace and stability [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=193.96s)]
*  in the region. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=198.56s)]
*  And they talked about Iran, specifically their nuclear ambitions and their desire to build [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=200.04s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=206.28s)]
*  This comes after the president yesterday signed an executive order to, quote, maximize pressure [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=207.5s)]
*  on Iran. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=213.72s)]
*  And he imposed tough sanctions because he says he wants to drive the oil export to zero. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=214.96s)]
*  So essentially they don't have any money to work on any nuclear capability, Errol. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  A lot of big headlines during Trump's first 100 days this of his second term. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=227.12s)]
*  Weijia Zhang, thanks so much for joining us from the White House. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIiMhar4VsE&t=231.28s)]
