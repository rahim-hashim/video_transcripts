# Fact-checking Trump's claims on Social Security fraud, DOGE cuts
**CBS News:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo)
*  All right, switching back now to the address last night, President Trump's congressional [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=0.0s)]
*  address to Congress was so long, it made history and it gave us lots to unpack after a whirlwind [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=4.28s)]
*  six weeks in office. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=11.08s)]
*  Let's bring in Rona Tarrant, the executive editor of CBS News confirmed, Rona, great [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  to see you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=16.98s)]
*  Your team had a late night last night. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=18.2s)]
*  They spent all night fact checking President Trump's speech. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=19.96s)]
*  So let's begin with Trump's claim that millions of people over the age of 100 are receiving [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=23.36s)]
*  Social Security. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=28.919999999999998s)]
*  Let's listen to his remarks from last night. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=30.4s)]
*  We'll catch him with you on the other side. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=31.799999999999997s)]
*  Believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=34.36s)]
*  aged 100 to 109 years old. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=41.36s)]
*  It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  I don't know any of them. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=57.68s)]
*  I know some people that are rather elderly, but not quite that elderly. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=58.68s)]
*  3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=63.68s)]
*  Millions of people over the age of 100 are receiving Social Security. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=73.16s)]
*  Rona, what did your team find? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=76.48s)]
*  Well this is something that President Trump and Elon Musk have said for a number of weeks. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=80.32s)]
*  The idea that there are a lot of people over the age of 100, 120, 150 even, who are receiving [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=84.04s)]
*  Social Security payments. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=89.72s)]
*  Now we have been looking into this. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  There is no evidence for this. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  And there's a few things to point to here. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=94.84s)]
*  One the most recent thing is there was a statement actually from the acting chief of the Social [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=97.04s)]
*  Security Administration. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  And he said in sort of this long statement, there was one line that was quite interesting. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  Just because you're in the system for the Social Security Administration does not mean [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  that you're receiving benefits. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=111.28s)]
*  Now what that means is they have databases of people who, everybody who for example has [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=112.96s)]
*  received a Social Security number. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=116.94s)]
*  That does not mean that you're receiving payments. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=119.22s)]
*  There are also people in the system for example who they have no death record on file for. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  Or for some people who were in the system a long time ago, no birth record for. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=125.88s)]
*  So just because those people are in the system does not necessarily mean they're getting [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=130.48s)]
*  payments. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=133.84s)]
*  Now we also kind of digged into a few things. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=134.84s)]
*  Now what are the checks and balances in place? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=136.56s)]
*  They have a system in place where once you pass 115 years old, your payments actually [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=138.8s)]
*  get cut off. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=143.28s)]
*  We also looked at previous reports from the Office of the Inspector General. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=145.0s)]
*  Now their whole job is to figure out waste and abroad in the Social Security Administration. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  And there was a few interesting things. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=153.84s)]
*  One is a report from 2023. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=155.88000000000002s)]
*  They said there are around 44,000 people above the age of 100 who are receiving payments. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=157.58s)]
*  Now we compare that to the census of 2020 and there are around 80,000 people. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=163.0s)]
*  So that's very much within that realm. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=166.8s)]
*  And the final thing to say is it's not that there's no fraud within Social Security. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  There was a report back in 2024 where they looked at fraud and they found that these [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  were payments about less than 1% of total payments between 2015 and 2022 were fraudulent. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=177.72s)]
*  We looked for any example in that report that maybe for example it was somebody over 150 [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  years old and we could find no evidence of it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  So for that reason we found that to be false. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=191.72000000000003s)]
*  Alright well, Elon Musk, Rona, was also in the audience and Trump thanked him and claimed [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=194.12s)]
*  that DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, has been finding widespread fraud. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=198.48s)]
*  Let's play back some of his comments on that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=203.8s)]
*  Many more have been found out and exposed and swiftly terminated by a group of very [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=206.84s)]
*  intelligent, mostly young people headed up by Elon and we appreciate it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=211.36s)]
*  We found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=217.4s)]
*  Rona, your team actually looked into the data surrounding those DOGE cuts. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=222.44s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=226.23999999999998s)]
*  So President Trump was claiming there were hundreds of billions of dollars worth of fraud. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=229.72s)]
*  Now we have seen no evidence for this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=233.67999999999998s)]
*  The best insight we have is this DOGE website and they have like a thing called Wall of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=235.76s)]
*  Receipts where they're itemizing all of these contracts they say they're cutting. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  Now that itemization, it's less than 9 billion dollars, so certainly not hundreds of billions. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  And even within that 9 billion, there are numerous errors. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=249.67999999999998s)]
*  So the I unit here at CBS and the confirmed team actually dug into this and we found that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  for example, some contracts were counted multiple times or they were citing incorrect figures. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=257.32s)]
*  So we know that within that there are numerous errors. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=263.56s)]
*  So there's no evidence so far that we have seen that they have actually identified hundreds [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=266.59999999999997s)]
*  of thousands of dollars or billions of dollars worth of fraud. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=271.15999999999997s)]
*  I asked when the White House was asked about this, the press secretary Caroline Levitt [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=274.28s)]
*  said that, you know, they believe that all of these are waste and abuse and fraud, that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=277.84s)]
*  arguably any of these contracts are a waste of American taxpayer dollars, but none of [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=282.52s)]
*  them actually called out fraud specifically. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=287.52s)]
*  We also heard Trump talk about retaking the Panama Canal. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=290.23999999999995s)]
*  This is a goal that he's talked about since the start of his presidency and he made this [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=292.91999999999996s)]
*  claim last night. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=298.0s)]
*  Let's play back those comments. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=299.12s)]
*  The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others, but others could [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=301.4s)]
*  use it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  But it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=313.23999999999995s)]
*  They died of malaria. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=318.28s)]
*  They died of snake bites and mosquitoes. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=319.4s)]
*  Not a nice place to work. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=322.0s)]
*  They paid them very highly to go there knowing there was a 25% chance that they would die. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=324.52s)]
*  So what did CBS News confirm find out about that? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=331.06s)]
*  So it is true that a large number of people died building the Panama Canal, but historical [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=335.56s)]
*  records don't line up with that 38,000 figure. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=339.98s)]
*  Now during the French era of building the Panama Canal, we know around 22,000 workers [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=343.22s)]
*  died. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=347.58s)]
*  Following that, there was an American led era of building the Panama Canal. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=348.58s)]
*  Now we dug through those historical records last night. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=352.3s)]
*  We found that on record around 5,600 workers died during that American era, but they weren't [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=355.18s)]
*  all American. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=361.90000000000003s)]
*  Around 350 of them were American, but a lot of them were from the West Indies. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=362.90000000000003s)]
*  So even if you count up the French era and the American era, it doesn't add up to 38,000 [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=368.02s)]
*  and they certainly weren't all Americans. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=372.74s)]
*  Rhona Tarrant with CBS News confirmed. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=375.1s)]
*  Thank you so much for all that hard work last night. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e3rP-vj5Wo&t=377.02s)]
