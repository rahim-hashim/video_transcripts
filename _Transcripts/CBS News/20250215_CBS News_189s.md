**CBS News:** [February 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA)
*  Today a bold call from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During his address at the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=0.0s)]
*  Munich Security Council, Zelensky said the time has come to create a European army. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=4.64s)]
*  A day after Vice President JD Vance gave remarks scolding European leaders, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=10.16s)]
*  Zelensky warned Europe could not rely on America's support for its defense. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=14.72s)]
*  Elizabeth Palmer is in Munich with more. Elizabeth, good morning. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=19.44s)]
*  Good morning. It took Vice President JD Vance just a few minutes to infuriate many of Europe's top [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=22.88s)]
*  politicians. This morning on this side of the Atlantic, the papers are calling his keynote [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  address here in Munich vengeful, preachy, unkind, and they're saying that it really serves to deepen [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=36.64s)]
*  the risk between the United States and some of its oldest staunchest allies. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  Vice President Vance accused mainstream European politicians of failing to control immigration [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=49.52s)]
*  and then eroding free speech by muzzling anti-immigration parties from the far right. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=55.2s)]
*  The threat that I worry the most about vis-a-vis Europe is not Russia, it's not China, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=60.96s)]
*  it's not any other external actor, and what I worry about is the threat from within. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=66.48s)]
*  The speech got a chilly reaction in the room. The press was very upset. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=72.48s)]
*  The speech got a chilly reaction in the room and provoked red hot anger afterwards. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=77.36s)]
*  He compared parts of Europe to authoritarian regimes, said Germany's defense minister [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=84.32s)]
*  Boris Pistorius, and that is unacceptable. Vance then went on to meet Alice Weidel, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=89.44s)]
*  the leader of Germany's far-right AFD party. Her party, which is threatened to deport migrants of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=96.88s)]
*  non-German ethnic heritage, is polling well going into national elections next weekend. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=103.68s)]
*  All eyes had been on a meeting between the U.S. vice president, the secretary of state, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=110.56s)]
*  and Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky. We want the war to come to a close. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=115.28s)]
*  We want only half an hour. The meeting ended with no new information on how the U.S. would help [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=120.56s)]
*  bring an end to Russia's war with Ukraine or what role Ukraine would play in negotiations. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=125.76s)]
*  In a speech this morning, Zelensky didn't give any more hints on that. Instead, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=132.64s)]
*  he referred back to the Vance keynote address. Yesterday here in Munich, the U.S. vice president [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=137.84s)]
*  made it clear. Decades, he said, decades of the old relationship between Europe and America are [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  ending. The U.S. would no longer ensure security in Europe, he said, so it was urgent that Europe [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=152.48s)]
*  create its own standing army. There is a little news on a possible way ahead for talks that would [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=159.6s)]
*  end Russia's war in Ukraine, and it comes from the Saudi government, which tweeted this morning [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=168.72s)]
*  that it, I quote, commended the phone call between presidents Putin and Trump and the talk of a [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=174.56s)]
*  summit in Saudi to discuss the issue further sometime soon. Michelle, Liz Palmer, thank you. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_v4e979VHA&t=180.95999999999998s)]
