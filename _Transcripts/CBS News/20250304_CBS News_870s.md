# Full details on Trump tariffs against Mexico, Canada and China
**CBS News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY)
*  So let's start with a deep dive on these fresh new tariffs levied by the Trump administration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=0.0s)]
*  Canada, Mexico, China, all impacted by this and its sparking fears of a trade war that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=4.4s)]
*  ultimately will have an impact on the price of what you pay for goods. Global markets are on edge [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=10.16s)]
*  as imports from Canada and Mexico are now to be taxed at 25%. Tariffs on Chinese imports have [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=15.52s)]
*  doubled to 20% and in response, China and Canada have retaliated with their own tariffs on U.S. goods [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=23.04s)]
*  and Mexico is vowing to do the same come Sunday. Let's bring in CBS News Senior White House and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  political correspondent Ed O'Keefe. Ed, we just heard from the Mexican president this morning saying [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=37.28s)]
*  that she is cooperating with the U.S. on things like narcotics and counterterrorism. She's vowing [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=43.36s)]
*  to respond economically Sunday. How is the president justifying these tariffs? Some are [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=49.36s)]
*  describing them as a punishment. And the Mexican president is saying she hopes to speak with [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=54.96s)]
*  President Trump on Thursday. We are waiting for formal confirmation from the White House that there [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=59.92s)]
*  may be such a conversation. Look, we are in essence in the middle of a trade war now between these four [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  countries essentially started by the United States and now we're anticipating retaliation that is [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=73.28s)]
*  essentially going to lead to higher prices overall on goods coming from Canada and goods coming from [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=79.76s)]
*  China and if Mexico makes good on it, goods coming from Mexico as well unless the United States [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  suddenly backs off. Remember, these kinds of disputes can be temporary, they can last a while [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=88.72s)]
*  and they can be retaliated against again. So we start it, Canada retaliates, we could retaliate [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=93.92s)]
*  and it could keep going like that for a while. We'll have to wait and see. But the president [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=100.48s)]
*  insisting that this is something that has to happen, he casts it, his administration likes to cast it in [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  part as a war on drugs because of the concern about the illegal shipment of fentanyl into the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=109.44s)]
*  United States. Certainly most of it coming from Mexico in some cases by way of parts of fentanyl [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=114.72s)]
*  produced in Canada or in China, forgive me, China. Canada then has just a minuscule amount [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  comparably that comes in from the north into the United States. The president trying again, casting [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=128.24s)]
*  this as if you don't work on helping us fight the drug problem, we're going to continue to retaliate [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=132.56s)]
*  with these tariffs and we've seen some progress certainly on the Mexican side of the border, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=137.76000000000002s)]
*  the Canadians insisting that they have amped up their border security and anti-drug operations as [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=142.56s)]
*  well in the last month or so but regardless it's now underway and we're going to watch today, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=148.96s)]
*  Erroll, among other things to see how the markets react to this because that is a gauge that the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=152.88s)]
*  president is quite sensitive to in part because he likes to track it and because a lot of the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=157.44s)]
*  people around him are close to him that phone into him are also of course invested heavily in the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=162.4s)]
*  stock market. Yeah we're looking at the Dow Jones pulling back 600 points this morning already. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=166.8s)]
*  Ed, there's another way in which President Trump is pulling economic levers to get what he wants [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=171.92s)]
*  from other nations. The Trump administration now freezing aid to Ukraine, walk us through this [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=176.4s)]
*  decision and how it's working. Well so let's remember that there's about 3.85 billion dollars [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=182.48s)]
*  left in what's called presidential drawdown authority or money a president can tap to spend [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=189.6s)]
*  on Ukraine's defense that's left over from the Biden years all but 385 billion of the authority [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=196.56s)]
*  has been spent. No new money has been spent by the Trump administration since he took office on [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=202.48s)]
*  January 20th so in essence what he's now declaring has already sort of been policy [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=208.56s)]
*  for the last month plus anyway and that he's not authorizing anything new. A lot of the money [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=214.08s)]
*  that was authorized by President Biden is still in essence being spent and things are still being [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=219.36s)]
*  delivered and there's been some indication from the Ukrainians that they've got about six months [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=224.16s)]
*  worth of supply before they really start running into shortages and so conceivably again another [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  potentially temporary problem if you were to see a resumption of talks between the United States [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=236.08s)]
*  and Ukraine which of course the president says only happens if Zelensky somehow signals remorse [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  or apology for what happened last Friday here at the White House then conceivably he could turn the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=246.96s)]
*  spigot back on and then of course you have the Europeans working towards coming up with a new [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=251.36s)]
*  defense pact that would also assist Ukraine but of course they want to do that in concert with the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=255.68s)]
*  United States so a lot there to be sorted out as well. And it's worth acknowledging that for a lot [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=260.0s)]
*  of Republican voters and Republican representatives they were weary of endless aid to Ukraine so that [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=264.72s)]
*  they could make priorities for Americans and voters and when it comes to the president's [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=270.88000000000005s)]
*  address tonight Ed as you've emphasized so many times all politics is local if people are [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=276.0s)]
*  experiencing increasing costs for things like eggs inflation continues to rear its ugly head [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=281.12s)]
*  how will the president overall justify his moves? Well the White House says he's expected to focus [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=286.56s)]
*  much of the speech tonight on the economy on fighting inflation and on his decision to impose [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=292.72s)]
*  these tariffs that would be wise because our recent CBS News polling suggests most American [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=296.88000000000005s)]
*  voters still chiefly concerned about inflation and the economy and while he has spent much of [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=301.44000000000005s)]
*  the last several days focused on things like tariffs like the war in Ukraine or like downsizing [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=306.24s)]
*  the federal government those issues rank lower in concern or interest than the economy and inflation [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  so the White House claiming at this hour at least that that'll be a big focus of the speech tonight [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=316.48s)]
*  let's remember though whether it was his campaign whether it was his previous White House whether [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=320.48s)]
*  it's his current White House they may say one thing during the day ahead of a big moment [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=324.64000000000004s)]
*  he'll do whatever it is he wants to do later tonight when he speaks but for now at least [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=328.64000000000004s)]
*  they're signaling much of the address will focus on the economy and an explanation of the changes [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=333.36s)]
*  the real huge changes he's made in foreign policy over the last 45 days or so. Yeah that's why it's [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=338.24s)]
*  always good to watch the speech live because those unscripted moments can say much more than some of [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=343.68s)]
*  the talking points ahead of time. Ed O'Keefe from the White House for us great to see you this morning [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=348.64s)]
*  Ed thank you for that and do stay with CBS News 24 seven all day for continuing coverage of the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=353.12s)]
*  president's address to congress join us at 5 p.m eastern for a special edition of America Decides [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=358.24s)]
*  the speech is at 9 p.m followed by the Democratic response and then of course we'll have analysis [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  and highlights from our team of correspondents and contributors. All right let's dive further now into [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=368.47999999999996s)]
*  the tariffs we discussed earlier in the show is that long anticipated measure by the U.S. against [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=373.76s)]
*  Canada Mexico and China and now in effect you're looking at a live look at the Dow Jones industrial [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=379.2s)]
*  average this morning but what does this really mean for you for me for our wallets CBS News [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=384.96s)]
*  business analyst Jill Schlesinger joins me now from studio 57 she also has a wallet but she knows [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=391.12s)]
*  more than the rest of us so Jill for folks who are uninitiated just break down for us how this tariff [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=396.08s)]
*  top line makes its way to our wallets when we pay for goods eventually you know when you have a U.S. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=402.48s)]
*  company that imports a good say from Canada or Mexico that company is now going to have to pay [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=408.88s)]
*  this fee this tariff and what normally will happen this is what happened when we had the last round [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  of tariffs is that the company will pass along either all of that fee to the consumers or part [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=419.68s)]
*  of it and what usually will happen is that the categories of goods that come from places like [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=425.44s)]
*  China and Canada or Mexico will trickle down to us and we'll pay more for those things so what are [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=431.68s)]
*  we talking about we're talking about something like a house we know from the National Association [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=438.16s)]
*  of Home Builders that we get about 25 percent of housing from Canada or Mexico so maybe it's [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=442.72s)]
*  lumber from Canada gypsum from Mexico that could add to pressure in the housing market we know that [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=449.2s)]
*  autos that you know we assembled them in the United States but to get to a finished product [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=455.28000000000003s)]
*  we can go back and forth between Canada Mexico up to eight times so that means a fee will get paid [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=459.84s)]
*  eight different times it could raise the price of a car by about three thousand dollars per vehicle [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=466.47999999999996s)]
*  and of course food costs we know so much of our fruits and vegetables they come from Mexico I [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=471.35999999999996s)]
*  think that's where you start to see the prices jump pretty quickly with perishable items and poor me [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=477.59999999999997s)]
*  because of course there's also going to be a problem with tequila so tequila drinkers will [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=484.0s)]
*  be looking elsewhere I think because it will start to cost more to drink anything imported [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=488.56s)]
*  from Mexico well you know we you make a lighthearted joke but it's a great point overall that this [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=493.44s)]
*  impacts every aspect of life in some way shape or form we noted that you know Wall Street pulled [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=499.68s)]
*  back yesterday and this morning on news of this hitting but what is the short and long-term [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=506.08s)]
*  impact are we likely to see greater costs down the line rather than anything happening this week [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=511.44s)]
*  well I'm not sure we'll see anything this week except that stock market volatility that big down [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=516.5600000000001s)]
*  day yesterday and down today I think what we're likely to see is that prices will drift higher [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=521.36s)]
*  we could see the inflation rate move from around three percent to say three and a half maybe even [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=526.16s)]
*  four percent if these tariffs stay in place for a really long period of time now of course nobody [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=530.88s)]
*  wants that but we're not going back to the worst of the COVID inflation spike where we had nine [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=536.32s)]
*  percent annual inflation I also think that people have to understand that these tariffs could slow [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=541.52s)]
*  down growth and what do we mean by that doesn't mean we're going to propel into a recession [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=547.84s)]
*  tomorrow but if the economy was set to grow by say two and a half percent this year these tariffs [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=553.12s)]
*  will start to change the way people individuals and businesses spend money that could mean that [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=559.28s)]
*  we see them pull back growth could start to pull back it does not necessarily mean again we're [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=565.28s)]
*  it's going to be the worst thing ever but I think we should be prepared that it's going to be a [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=571.76s)]
*  bumpy ride if you're an individual and you're freaked out about these market moves I would [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=575.92s)]
*  encourage you not so much to mess around with your retirement account but do look at your cash [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=580.72s)]
*  position do you have six to twelve months of emergency reserves built up have you tried to [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=585.92s)]
*  really pay down that debt that's outstanding I think those are critical things that you can do [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=591.44s)]
*  today to prepare for an uncertain future messing around with your retirement account moving from [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=596.32s)]
*  stocks to bonds or cash you're not going to time the market so try to avoid making any big decisions [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=602.32s)]

*  business owners on both sides of the northern border are really bracing for what's next as [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=629.04s)]
*  Jill alluded to there let's bring in CBS News national correspondent Lana Zaxi is in Windsor, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=633.52s)]
*  Ontario in Canada for us Lana great to have you in the focal point of one side of this trade war [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=639.1999999999999s)]
*  what are Canadians telling you about how they see this economic battle [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=646.16s)]
*  so they're devastated they thought that the United States and Canada were on the same team [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=651.12s)]
*  look just over my shoulder here this is the ambassador bridge Errol 2.3 million trucks [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=658.0s)]
*  pass over this bridge between the United States here in Windsor and Detroit just over the border [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=664.24s)]
*  there and it has been a it has been a border that has been built on cooperation and I spoke with [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=670.0s)]
*  the CEO of Laval manufacturing John as a party yesterday and he told me more about how he's [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=675.84s)]
*  feeling take a listen what I would say is that it feels similar to what I would describe as a funeral [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=682.64s)]
*  most people say well that seems very eerie and odd considering this is a this is a trade [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=689.92s)]
*  negotiation but you have to understand that for many years we've done everything we could [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=693.84s)]
*  to make the relationship between us and the United States grow we've invested in each other's [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=698.56s)]
*  economies most of us have family on both sides of the border some of us have the most fondest [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=704.48s)]
*  memories on the other side of the border so to hear that we're putting this this this impediment [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=709.12s)]
*  between our two countries it seems like a wedge and I can only describe it like losing a family [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=713.9200000000001s)]
*  a family member or somebody you would you know a loved one [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=718.48s)]
*  and he went on to explain that it isn't just a one-time tariff of 25 percent especially now [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=723.6800000000001s)]
*  that those tariffs look to become reciprocal between Canada and the United States he described [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=729.52s)]
*  that in his manufacturing process he imports U.S. Steel so those trucks come over the border with [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=734.88s)]
*  U.S. Steel that's looking at potentially a 25 percent tariff on that part on on the wholesale [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=739.92s)]
*  prices of that they build a mold here and then they send it back over to the United States where [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=745.4399999999999s)]
*  it's going to get another 25 percent tariff it's refined there in Detroit comes back over to him [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=749.52s)]
*  another 25 percent tariff and back and forth five times before it finally makes it into those [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=754.8s)]
*  consumer goods that you and I are purchasing and as much as possible he says he's going to try and [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=759.5999999999999s)]
*  absorb those tariffs but of course that is not sustainable his company he says can only survive [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=764.64s)]
*  that for about six to nine months stunning to hear him describe it as grief and what is Prime [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=769.5999999999999s)]
*  Minister Trudeau saying about claims from President Trump that large amounts of fentanyl is being [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=774.8s)]
*  trafficked from the northern border we know that the Mexican president says she's already working [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=779.76s)]
*  with the U.S. to stamp out the trade of illicit drugs and weapons but what's happening on the [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=784.0s)]
*  Canadian side well that's where there's complete disbelief Trudeau said there is no justification [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=788.8s)]
*  for these actions because there is very little fentanyl that actually crosses this border [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=796.24s)]
*  in fact the Canadian government here has invested more than a billion dollars in trying to stop any [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=802.72s)]
*  fentanyl from going over the border into the United States and let's be real fentanyl is a [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=809.52s)]
*  problem we should be all trying to address it but they have been working to address it and as a [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=814.8s)]
*  result in the period between December and January there was a near zero apprehension of fentanyl by [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=820.16s)]
*  U.S. border customs and protection actually the amount I'll give it to you 0.03 pounds were seized [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=826.96s)]
*  and so they don't understand at this point what they're supposed to be doing in addition to the [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=836.16s)]
*  helicopters and the patrols and the additional staffing that they have sent to make sure that [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=842.0s)]
*  there is no fentanyl that crosses especially given that they've had these positive results [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=846.7199999999999s)]
*  and that's why we're seeing these reciprocal tariffs coming from Canada as well so interesting [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=851.68s)]
*  Lana Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expected to make an address later this hour we'll see how [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=856.4s)]
*  much he touches on those stats that you've referenced a very interesting angle of all this [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=861.6s)]
*  Lana's at great to see you thanks so much for your reporting [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEujg6Q4uXY&t=866.72s)]
