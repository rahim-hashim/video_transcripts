# Border agents instructed to deport migrants without granting asylum hearings
**CBS News:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk)
*  US border agents have now been directed by the Trump White House to deport migrants crossing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=0.0s)]
*  into the US without any asylum requests allowed. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=5.4s)]
*  So CBS News immigration reporter Camilo Montoya Galvez, you obtained an internal memo about [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=9.48s)]
*  these changes. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=14.88s)]
*  What are the details here? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=15.88s)]
*  I read according to the internal Customs and Border Protection memo that we obtained here [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=18.76s)]
*  at CBS News, officials along the US Mexico border, along the US Canada border, and in [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=22.8s)]
*  coastal sectors like Florida are now directed to swiftly and summarily deport migrants who [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=28.64s)]
*  are entering the country illegally, importantly, without affording them the opportunity read [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=34.96s)]
*  to request asylum in a US immigration court. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=40.92s)]
*  That traditionally has been an obligation under domestic and international refugee law [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=45.32s)]
*  designed to ensure that governments are not sending people to places where they could [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=50.84s)]
*  be persecuted. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  But that asylum law under again domestic and international treaties has now been suspended [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=57.5s)]
*  effectively by this order by President Trump that cites an authority known as 212F that [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=64.02s)]
*  allows presidents read to suspend the entry of foreigners who are determined to pose a [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=71.42s)]
*  detrimental impact to US interests and so border patrol agents across the country can [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=76.98s)]
*  now enforce this directive by the president. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=82.78s)]
*  Some people may ask Reed that the Biden administration had already imposed restrictions on asylum [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=86.26s)]
*  and whether that policy is still in place and the answer to that question is that yes [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=93.62s)]
*  the Biden administration had imposed significant restrictions on asylum but that policy still [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=98.78s)]
*  allowed some people who expressed concern and fear of being harmed in their home countries [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=103.94s)]
*  to be interviewed by an asylum officer that will no longer happen. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=108.74s)]
*  Additionally that Biden administration asylum crackdown read included one major exemption [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=114.38s)]
*  and that was the CBP one app that is the smartphone application that the Biden administration [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=120.5s)]
*  used to allow people waiting in Mexico to request a time to be processed in a legal [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=126.14s)]
*  and orderly way at official border crossings. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=131.78s)]
*  The Trump administration read has shut that down. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=134.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=137.3s)]
*  So just to boil it to the bones you come in you will go directly out regardless of any [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=138.3s)]
*  asylum claim. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=142.3s)]
*  Camilo thank you so much for that breaking news we appreciate it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=143.42000000000002s)]
*  We're glad that you have that memo we'll be watching for your social media for more [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=146.66000000000003s)]
*  articulation on this story throughout the afternoon. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWKB009iELk&t=149.38000000000002s)]
