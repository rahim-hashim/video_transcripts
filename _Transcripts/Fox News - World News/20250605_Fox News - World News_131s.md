# BREAKING: Trump holds phone call with China's Xi
**Fox News - World News:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg)
*  So we got some breaking news from the White House. There has been a phone call between President Trump and President Xi of China [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=0.0s)]
*  It lasted about an hour and a half and apparently it was about trade and only trade [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=7.16s)]
*  There was a post coming on through social here and I'll try and hit the highlights for you [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=13.48s)]
*  Just concluded a very good phone call with Xi of China [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Discussing some of the intricacies of our recently made and agreed to trade deal the call lasted approximately one and a half hours [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=21.72s)]
*  Result on a very positive conclusion for both countries. There should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of rare earth products [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=28.12s)]
*  Our respective teams meeting shortly at a location to be determined [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=36.68s)]
*  We will be represented by Treasury Secretary Scott Besson's Howard Lutnick and Ambassador Jameson Greer [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=40.08s)]
*  during the conversation [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=46.8s)]
*  Xi graciously invited the first lady and me to visit China and I reciprocated [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=48.28s)]
*  As presidents of two great nations and something that we both look forward to the conversation was focused almost entirely on trade [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=54.44s)]
*  Nothing discussed concerning Russia Ukraine or Iran will inform the media as the scheduling the location and soon to be meeting [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=61.44s)]
*  thank you for your attention to this matter, which has been a [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  way to conclude a lot of the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=73.2s)]
*  True social posts Jackie you're there every day. Yeah, what do you make of what we just heard? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=75.4s)]
*  Well, I think it's probably the news that everyone's looking for in terms of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=80.36s)]
*  Where things are headed with the trade talks after the president posted overnight the other night that he likes G [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  He's known for a long time, but he's a really tough guy to make a deal with so this sounds a lot more optimistic about the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=90.8s)]
*  Direction that the trade talks are going and I do find it kind of interesting that he [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  Noted specifically that there was no discussion about Iran Russia and Ukraine [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=100.96s)]
*  Because China is going to be playing a role in you know trying to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=106.8s)]
*  Figure out how to resolve some of those issues and if they can work together, that'll be really important [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=111.64s)]
*  So no doubt. We'll see just watching the markets. They've had a bit of a turnaround not too dramatic [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=117.04s)]
*  But they have gone to green since this [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=121.2s)]
*  Was posted just barely in the green [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtbEDUeGdg&t=125.16s)]
