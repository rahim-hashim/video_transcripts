# Iran was moving forward with plans to destroy Israel, US: Ambassador
**Fox News - World News:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg)
*  Let's bring in Israel's ambassador to the union, Danny Danon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  It was a successful operation yesterday from Israel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  What intelligence did you gain through the Mossad that made this attack so imminent that [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=11.28s)]
*  you guys felt like you all had to take action yesterday? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=17.36s)]
*  Well, I agree with you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=20.68s)]
*  It was a historic night last night. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=22.2s)]
*  For years we hear the threats coming from Iran to destroy Israel, to destroy the U.S. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=24.84s)]
*  But we gathered the intelligence that they're actually moving forward. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=29.7s)]
*  Basically, there are a few ideas that we realized that are going to implement them. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=32.74s)]
*  One that we all talk about is the nuclear capabilities. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=37.74s)]
*  They already have it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=40.22s)]
*  It's a matter of days. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=41.5s)]
*  Second, is the ballistic missiles. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=42.5s)]
*  We don't speak a lot about it, but they had a mass production of ballistic missiles. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=44.7s)]
*  They wanted to be at the same level of the U.S. and Russia in terms of the number of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=49.54s)]
*  ballistic missiles, to produce every month hundreds of missiles, and to threaten Israel [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=53.14s)]
*  with a mega power of ballistic missiles. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=58.5s)]
*  And third, the proxies. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=62.14s)]
*  They were going to initiate another attack like October 7th. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=63.5s)]
*  Once we gathered the information about that, we decided not to wait. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=67.18s)]
*  We believed their intentions. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=70.9s)]
*  History have taught us to take very seriously threats from radical regimes. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=73.14s)]
*  And also, look what happened there last night. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=77.5s)]
*  One hundred bombs. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=80.18s)]
*  We expect very intense days ahead of us. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=81.4s)]
*  We expect ballistic missiles that will fly into Israel. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=84.02000000000001s)]
*  It will be very challenging for us. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=87.34s)]
*  But we took that risk because we realized the option to wait for Iran to actually assemble [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=89.25999999999999s)]
*  the nuclear capability on the ballistic missiles, we cannot wait for that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=95.38s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, did you destroy their entire nuclear program? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=99.62s)]
*  Is the nuclear threat gone now? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=103.38s)]
*  Well, it's still not over. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=105.3s)]
*  It's going to be a long operation. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=108.06s)]
*  You know, Iran is a huge country, and they spread the facilities all around Iran. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=109.58s)]
*  It will require more efforts from our side. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=115.78s)]
*  And we are determined. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=118.46000000000001s)]
*  We are determined to finish the job. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  We know it will require not only major efforts from our military and air force. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=121.34s)]
*  You know, last night, more than 200 aircrafts took part in the operation. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=125.78s)]
*  But also the civilians in Israel. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=131.02s)]
*  We have to be strong. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=133.14s)]
*  We have to be brave. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=134.14s)]
*  And we are ready for that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=135.62s)]
*  We prepared them last night. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=136.68s)]
*  We told them to get ready. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=138.18s)]
*  It's going to be hard for the population, but it's worth it because it will allow us [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=140.02s)]
*  to stay and to live and to prosper. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=144.1s)]
*  So this action has been going on for not quite 12 hours yet. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=146.34s)]
*  Has anything happened over the last 12 hours that has surprised you? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=150.68s)]
*  Is there anything that you thought that Iran was capable of or was not capable of that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  has happened? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=159.98s)]
*  First, you know, without getting into details, you know, we have to give credit to our intelligence. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=160.98s)]
*  You know, the activities of the Mossad, you know, the actions that were taking in Iran, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=165.34s)]
*  not only with aircrafts. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=170.34s)]
*  You know, and I think today that way you look at the leadership of Iran this morning, it's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=172.78s)]
*  a different one. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=176.58s)]
*  Many of the bad actors are not with us anymore. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=177.9s)]
*  And that makes the world a better place for all of us. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=180.82s)]
*  Regarding Iran, you know, they move slowly. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=184.22s)]
*  Also, when we had another operation, it took them a few days to react. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=186.62s)]
*  So we expect to see more coming from Iran into Israel. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=192.02s)]
*  How were you able to find out where these sites were, where these military leaders were? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=195.14s)]
*  Well, you know, the sites, you know, it's we knew for years about the locations of the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=199.86s)]
*  site. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=203.62s)]
*  Regarding the leadership, you know, we have very good intelligence and we showed them, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=204.62s)]
*  but we can actually get to them. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=208.06s)]
*  And you know, we attacked only people who were involved with the nuclear program or [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=209.98000000000002s)]
*  people who were involved in the military, and we targeted them. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=213.62s)]
*  But we proved to the Iranians that we can get anywhere into Iran today. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=216.96s)]
*  We have nothing against the Iranian people. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=221.9s)]
*  You know, we pray that they will have a better leadership and a better future. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=223.66000000000003s)]
*  But we definitely, we went after the leaders of the regime. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=227.66s)]
*  How confident are you that you've avoided any civilian targets? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=230.85999999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, we look at the time that the attack took place, you know, middle of the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=234.46s)]
*  night. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=239.46s)]
*  So usually you don't have people in the streets. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=240.46s)]
*  And we took the precautions to minimize casualties. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=242.78s)]
*  So, Mr. Ambassador, I guess this is a two-part question. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=245.3s)]
*  You said part of the intelligence that you gathered was they were planning some other [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=249.85999999999999s)]
*  attack like October 7. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=253.34s)]
*  And then you had the United States that was trying to negotiate peace as well. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=256.54s)]
*  At what point in the conversation did you realize that the Iranians were not interested [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=260.90000000000003s)]
*  in peace? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=267.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, you know, we have experience with the Iranians. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=268.52000000000004s)]
*  They are masters in deception, in talks, and at the same time moving very fast. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=271.42s)]
*  And once we realized that they are lying and that they are actually moving forward, you [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=277.22s)]
*  mentioned October 7. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=281.46000000000004s)]
*  Let's remind everybody what happened on October 7. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=282.94s)]
*  Thousands of rockets flew into Israel. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=285.58s)]
*  And at the same time, Hamas invaded our communities in the south. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=287.82s)]
*  So imagine Iran would have the capability to send thousands of ballistic missiles into [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=291.26s)]
*  Israel. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=296.14s)]
*  Everyone would have to be in shelters. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=297.14s)]
*  And then they wanted to actually send their proxies to invade Israel again. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=298.8s)]
*  So we didn't wait this time. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=301.97999999999996s)]
*  We were caught by surprise on October 7 with Iran. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=303.74s)]
*  We decided that we were not going to wait. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=306.58s)]
*  So did y'all stop that follow-up attack, or did y'all have intelligence of that future [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=308.46s)]
*  attack happening? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=314.04s)]
*  So we knew that they had the intention. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=315.04s)]
*  And as I mentioned earlier, they wanted to build the capabilities of the ballistic missiles, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=317.32s)]
*  to send everybody into the shelters, to allow their proxies to invade Israel. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=321.92s)]
*  So it was a preemptive attack to defend Israel. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=326.76000000000005s)]
*  And I think the world will thank us. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=330.04s)]
*  Maybe not today. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=331.64000000000004s)]
*  We were going to hear condemnation. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=332.64000000000004s)]
*  I'm sure that the UN today is going to be a rough day for me and my team. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=333.64000000000004s)]
*  But you know, look what happened in the 80s when we attacked the nuclear reactor in Iraq. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=337.42s)]
*  And then everybody praised Israel. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=342.92s)]
*  Same happened when we attacked the nuclear reactor in Syria. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=345.74s)]
*  And I'm sure that in the future, people will recognize that what we did last night was [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=348.64000000000004s)]
*  a historic moment not only for Israel, but for Western civilization. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=352.92s)]
*  Yeah, the most significant attack on Iran since the 80s during the war with Iraq. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=356.16s)]
*  Thank you so much, Ambassador, for coming on. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=361.0s)]
*  We're praying for y'all. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=363.08000000000004s)]
*  God bless you. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=364.08000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=365.08000000000004s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=366.08000000000004s)]
*  The, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, said the longer that they waited [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=367.08000000000004s)]
*  the greater the odds that Iran would have thousands of long-range deadly rockets and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=371.24s)]
*  possible nukes. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=376.8s)]
*  And he said this is a clear and present danger to Israel's very survival. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Uia8TfYVg&t=377.8s)]
